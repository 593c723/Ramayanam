       " 'BOOK 1': 'Canto I. Nárad.(7)OM.(8)To sainted Nárad, prince of thoseWhose lore in words of wisdom flows.Whose constant care and chief delightWere Scripture and ascetic rite,The good Válmíki, first and bestOf hermit saints, these words addressed:(9)\"In all this world, I pray thee, whoIs virtuous, heroic, true?Firm in his vows, of grateful mind,To every creature good and kind?Bounteous, and holy, just, and wise,Alone most fair to all men eyes?Devoid of envy, firm, and sage,Whose tranquil soul ne\\'er yields to rage?Whom, when his warrior wrath is high,Do Gods embattled fear and fly?Whose noble might and gentle skillThe triple world can guard from ill?Who is the best of princes, heWho loves his people good to see?The store of bliss, the living mineWhere brightest joys and virtues shine?Queen Fortune(10) best and dearest friend,Whose steps her choicest gifts attend?Who may with Sun and Moon compare,With Indra,(11) Vishnu,(12) Fire, and Air?Grant, Saint divine,(13) the boon I ask,For thee, I ween, an easy task,To whom the power is given to knowIf such a man breathe here below.\"Then Nárad, clear before whose eyeThe present, past, and future lie,(14)Made ready answer: \"Hermit, whereAre graces found so high and rare?Yet listen, and my tongue shall tellIn whom alone these virtues dwell.From old Ikshváku(15) line he came,Known to the world by Ráma name:With soul subdued, a chief of might,In Scripture versed, in glory bright,His steps in virtue paths are bent,Obedient, pure, and eloquent.In each emprise he wins success,And dying foes his power confess.Tall and broad-shouldered, strong of limb,Fortune has set her mark on him.Graced with a conch-shell triple line,His throat displays the auspicious sign.(16)High destiny is clear impressedOn massive jaw and ample chest,His mighty shafts he truly aims,And foemen in the battle tames.Deep in the muscle, scarcely shown,Embedded lies his collar-bone.His lordly steps are firm and free,His strong arms reach below his knee;(17)All fairest graces join to deckHis head, his brow, his stately neck,And limbs in fair proportion set:The manliest form e\\'er fashioned yet.Graced with each high imperial mark,His skin is soft and lustrous dark.Large are his eyes that sweetly shineWith majesty almost divine.His plighted word he ne\\'er forgets;On erring sense a watch he sets.By nature wise, his teacher skillHas trained him to subdue his will.Good, resolute and pure, and strong,He guards mankind from scathe and wrong,And lends his aid, and ne\\'er in vain,The cause of justice to maintain.Well has he studied o\\'er and o\\'erThe Vedas(18)and their kindred lore.Well skilled is he the bow to draw,(19)Well trained in arts and versed in law;High-souled and meet for happy fate,Most tender and compassionate;The noblest of all lordly givers,Whom good men follow, as the riversFollow the King of Floods, the sea:So liberal, so just is he.The joy of Queen Kausalyá(20)heart,In every virtue he has part:Firm as Himálaya(21) snowy steep,Unfathomed like the mighty deep:The peer of Vishnu power and might,And lovely as the Lord of Night;(22)Patient as Earth, but, roused to ire,Fierce as the world-destroying fire;In bounty like the Lord of Gold,(23)And Justice self in human mould.With him, his best and eldest son,By all his princely virtues wonKing Dasaratha(24) willed to shareHis kingdom as the Regent Heir.But when Kaikeyí, youngest queen,With eyes of envious hate had seenThe solemn pomp and regal statePrepared the prince to consecrate,She bade the hapless king bestowTwo gifts he promised long ago,That Ráma to the woods should flee,And that her child the heir should be.By chains of duty firmly tied,The wretched king perforce complied.Ráma, to please Kaikeyí wentObedient forth to banishment.Then Lakshman truth was nobly shown,Then were his love and courage known,When for his brother sake he daredAll perils, and his exile shared.And Sítá, Ráma darling wife,Loved even as he loved his life,Whom happy marks combined to bless,A miracle of loveliness,Of Janak royal lineage sprung,Most excellent of women, clungTo her dear lord, like RohiníRejoicing with the Moon to be.(25)The King and people, sad of mood,The hero car awhile pursued.But when Prince Ráma lighted downAt Sringavera pleasant town,Where Gangá holy waters flow,He bade his driver turn and go.Guha, Nishádas\\' king, he met,And on the farther bank was set.Then on from wood to wood they strayed,O\\'er many a stream, through constant shade,As Bharadvája bade them, tillThey came to Chitrakúta hill.And Ráma there, with Lakshman aid,A pleasant little cottage made,And spent his days with Sítá, dressedIn coat of bark and deerskin vest.(26)And Chitrakúta grew to beAs bright with those illustrious threeAs Meru(27) sacred peaks that shineWith glory, when the Gods reclineBeneath them: Siva(28) self betweenThe Lord of Gold and Beauty Queen.The aged king for Ráma pined,And for the skies the earth resigned.Bharat, his son, refused to reign,Though urged by all the twice-born(29) train.Forth to the woods he fared to meetHis brother, fell before his feet,And cried, \"Thy claim all men allow:O come, our lord and king be thou.\"But Ráma nobly chose to beObservant of his sire decree.He placed his sandals(30) in his handA pledge that he would rule the land:And bade his brother turn again.Then Bharat, finding prayer was vain,The sandals took and went away;Nor in Ayodhyá would he stay.But turned to Nandigráma, whereHe ruled the realm with watchful care,Still longing eagerly to learnTidings of Ráma safe return.Then lest the people should repeatTheir visit to his calm retreat,Away from Chitrakúta hillFared Ráma ever onward tillBeneath the shady trees he stoodOf Dandaká primeval wood,Virádha, giant fiend, he slew,And then Agastya friendship knew.Counselled by him he gained the swordAnd bow of Indra, heavenly lord:A pair of quivers too, that boreOf arrows an exhaustless store.While there he dwelt in greenwood shadeThe trembling hermits sought his aid,And bade him with his sword and bowDestroy the fiends who worked them woe:To come like Indra strong and brave,A guardian God to help and save.And Ráma falchion left its traceDeep cut on Súrpanakhá face:A hideous giantess who cameBurning for him with lawless flame.Their sister cries the giants heard.And vengeance in each bosom stirred:The monster of the triple head.And Dúshan to the contest sped.But they and myriad fiends besideBeneath the might of Ráma died.When Rávan, dreaded warrior, knewThe slaughter of his giant crew:Rávan, the king, whose name of fearEarth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:He bade the fiend Márícha aidThe vengeful plot his fury laid.In vain the wise Márícha triedTo turn him from his course aside:Not Rávan self, he said, might hopeWith Ráma and his strength to cope.Impelled by fate and blind with rageHe came to Ráma hermitage.There, by Márícha magic art,He wiled the princely youths apart,The vulture(31) slew, and bore awayThe wife of Ráma as his prey.The son of Raghu(32) came and foundJatáyu slain upon the ground.He rushed within his leafy cot;He sought his wife, but found her not.Then, then the hero senses failed;In mad despair he wept and wailed.Upon the pile that bird he laid,And still in quest of Sítá strayed.A hideous giant then he saw,Kabandha named, a shape of awe.The monstrous fiend he smote and slew,And in the flame the body threw;When straight from out the funeral flameIn lovely form Kabandha came,And bade him seek in his distressA wise and holy hermitess.By counsel of this saintly dameTo Pampá pleasant flood he came,And there the steadfast friendship wonOf Hanumán the Wind-God son.Counselled by him he told his griefTo great Sugríva, Vánar chief,Who, knowing all the tale, beforeThe sacred flame alliance swore.Sugríva to his new-found friendTold his own story to the end:His hate of Báli for the wrongAnd insult he had borne so long.And Ráma lent a willing earAnd promised to allay his fear.Sugríva warned him of the mightOf Báli, matchless in the fight,And, credence for his tale to gain,Showed the huge fiend(33) by Báli slain.The prostrate corse of mountain sizeSeemed nothing in the hero eyes;He lightly kicked it, as it lay,And cast it twenty leagues(34) away.To prove his might his arrows throughSeven palms in line, uninjured, flew.He cleft a mighty hill apart,And down to hell he hurled his dart.Then high Sugríva spirit rose,Assured of conquest o\\'er his foes.With his new champion by his sideTo vast Kishkindhá cave he hied.Then, summoned by his awful shout,King Báli came in fury out,First comforted his trembling wife,Then sought Sugríva in the strife.One shaft from Ráma deadly bowThe monarch in the dust laid low.Then Ráma bade Sugríva reignIn place of royal Báli slain.Then speedy envoys hurried forthEastward and westward, south and north,Commanded by the grateful kingTidings of Ráma spouse to bring.Then by Sampáti counsel led,Brave Hanumán, who mocked at dread,Sprang at one wild tremendous leapTwo hundred leagues across the deep.To Lanká(35) town he urged his way,Where Rávan held his royal sway.There pensive \\'neath Asoka(36) boughsHe found poor Sítá, Ráma spouse.He gave the hapless girl a ring,A token from her lord and king.A pledge from her fair hand he bore;Then battered down the garden door.Five captains of the host he slew,Seven sons of councillors o\\'erthrew;Crushed youthful Aksha on the field,Then to his captors chose to yield.Soon from their bonds his limbs were free,But honouring the high decreeWhich Brahmá(37) had pronounced of yore,He calmly all their insults bore.The town he burnt with hostile flame,And spoke again with Ráma dame,Then swiftly back to Ráma flewWith tidings of the interview.Then with Sugríva for his guide,Came Ráma to the ocean side.He smote the sea with shafts as brightAs sunbeams in their summer height,And quick appeared the Rivers\\' King(38)Obedient to the summoning.A bridge was thrown by Nala o\\'erThe narrow sea from shore to shore.(39)They crossed to Lanká golden town,Where Ráma hand smote Rávan down.Vibhishan there was left to reignOver his brother wide domain.To meet her husband Sítá came;But Ráma, stung with ire and shame,With bitter words his wife addressedBefore the crowd that round her pressed.But Sítá, touched with noble ire,Gave her fair body to the fire.Then straight the God of Wind appeared,And words from heaven her honour cleared.And Ráma clasped his wife again,Uninjured, pure from spot and stain,Obedient to the Lord of FireAnd the high mandate of his sire.Led by the Lord who rules the sky,The Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,And honoured him with worthy meed,Rejoicing in each glorious deed.His task achieved, his foe removed,He triumphed, by the Gods approved.By grace of Heaven he raised to lifeThe chieftains slain in mortal strife;Then in the magic chariot throughThe clouds to Nandigráma flew.Met by his faithful brothers there,He loosed his votive coil of hair:Thence fair Ayodhyá town he gained,And o\\'er his father kingdom reigned.Disease or famine ne\\'er oppressedHis happy people, richly blestWith all the joys of ample wealth,Of sweet content and perfect health.No widow mourned her well-loved mate,No sire his son untimely fate.They feared not storm or robber hand;No fire or flood laid waste the land:The Golden Age(40) had come againTo bless the days of Ráma reign.From him, the great and glorious king,Shall many a princely scion spring.And he shall rule, beloved by men,Ten thousand years and hundreds ten,(41)And when his life on earth is pastTo Brahmá world shall go at last.\"Whoe\\'er this noble poem readsThat tells the tale of Ráma deeds,Good as the Scriptures, he shall beFrom every sin and blemish free.Whoever reads the saving strain,With all his kin the heavens shall gain.Bráhmans who read shall gather henceThe highest praise for eloquence.The warrior, o\\'er the land shall reign,The merchant, luck in trade obtain;And Súdras listening(42) ne\\'er shall failTo reap advantage from the tale.(43)Canto II. Brahmá VisitVálmíki, graceful speaker, heard,To highest admiration stirred.To him whose fame the tale rehearsedHe paid his mental worship first;Then with his pupil humbly bentBefore the saint most eloquent.Thus honoured and dismissed the seerDeparted to his heavenly sphere.Then from his cot Válmíki hiedTo Tamasá(44) sequestered side,Not far remote from Gangá tide.He stood and saw the ripples rollPellucid o\\'er a pebbly shoal.To Bharadvája(45) by his sideHe turned in ecstasy, and cried:\"See, pupil dear, this lovely sight,The smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright,With not a speck or shade to mar,And clear as good men bosoms are.Here on the brink thy pitcher lay,And bring my zone of bark, I pray.Here will I bathe: the rill has not,To lave the limbs, a fairer spot.Do quickly as I bid, nor wasteThe precious time; away, and haste.\"Obedient to his master hestQuick from the cot he brought the vest;The hermit took it from his hand,And tightened round his waist the band;Then duly dipped and bathed him there,And muttered low his secret prayer.To spirits and to Gods he madeLibation of the stream, and strayedViewing the forest deep and wideThat spread its shade on every side.Close by the bank he saw a pairOf curlews sporting fearless there.But suddenly with evil mindAn outcast fowler stole behind,And, with an aim too sure and true,The male bird near the hermit slew.The wretched hen in wild despairWith fluttering pinions beat the air,And shrieked a long and bitter cryWhen low on earth she saw him lie,Her loved companion, quivering, dead,His dear wings with his lifeblood red;And for her golden crested mateShe mourned, and was disconsolate.The hermit saw the slaughtered bird,And all his heart with ruth was stirred.The fowler impious deed distressedHis gentle sympathetic breast,And while the curlew sad cries rangWithin his ears, the hermit sang:\"No fame be thine for endless time,Because, base outcast, of thy crime,Whose cruel hand was fain to slayOne of this gentle pair at play!\"E\\'en as he spoke his bosom wroughtAnd laboured with the wondering thoughtWhat was the speech his ready tongueHad uttered when his heart was wrung.He pondered long upon the speech,Recalled the words and measured each,And thus exclaimed the saintly guideTo Bharadvája by his side:\"With equal lines of even feet,With rhythm and time and tone complete,The measured form of words I spokeIn shock of grief be termed a sloke.\"(46)And Bharadvája, nothing slowHis faithful love and zeal to show,Answered those words of wisdom, \"BeThe name, my lord, as pleases thee.\"As rules prescribe the hermit tookSome lustral water from the brook.But still on this his constant thoughtKept brooding, as his home he sought;While Bharadvája paced behind,A pupil sage of lowly mind,And in his hand a pitcher boreWith pure fresh water brimming o\\'er.Soon as they reached their calm retreatThe holy hermit took his seat;His mind from worldly cares recalled,And mused in deepest thought enthralled.Then glorious Brahmá,(47) Lord Most High,Creator of the earth and sky,The four-faced God, to meet the sageCame to Válmíki hermitage.Soon as the mighty God he saw,Up sprang the saint in wondering awe.Mute, with clasped hands, his head he bent,And stood before him reverent.His honoured guest he greeted well,Who bade him of his welfare tell;Gave water for his blessed feet,Brought offerings,(48) and prepared a seat.In honoured place the God Most HighSate down, and bade the saint sit nigh.There sate before Válmíki eyesThe Father of the earth and skies;But still the hermit thoughts were bentOn one thing only, all intentOn that poor curlew mournful fateLamenting for her slaughtered mate;And still his lips, in absent mood,The verse that told his grief, renewed:\"Woe to the fowler impious handThat did the deed that folly planned;That could to needless death devoteThe curlew of the tuneful throat!\"The heavenly Father smiled in glee,And said, \"O best of hermits, see,A verse, unconscious, thou hast made;No longer be the task delayed.Seek not to trace, with labour vain,The unpremeditated strain.The tuneful lines thy lips rehearsedSpontaneous from thy bosom burst.Then come, O best of seers, relateThe life of Ráma good and great,The tale that saintly Nárad told,In all its glorious length unfold.Of all the deeds his arm has doneUpon this earth, omit not one,And thus the noble life recordOf that wise, brave, and virtuous lord.His every act to day displayed,His secret life to none betrayed:How Lakshman, how the giants fought;With high emprise and hidden thought:And all that Janak child(49) befellWhere all could see, where none could tell.The whole of this shall truly beMade known, O best of saints, to thee.In all thy poem, through my grace,No word of falsehood shall have place.Begin the story, and rehearseThe tale divine in charming verse.As long as in this firm-set landThe streams shall flow, the mountains stand,So long throughout the world, be sure,The great Rámáyan shall endure.(50)While the Rámáyan ancient strainShall glorious in the earth remain,To higher spheres shalt thou ariseAnd dwell with me above the skies.\"He spoke, and vanished into air,And left Válmíki wondering there.The pupils of the holy man,Moved by their love of him, beganTo chant that verse, and ever moreThey marvelled as they sang it o\\'er:\"Behold, the four-lined balanced rime,Repeated over many a time,In words that from the hermit brokeIn shock of grief, becomes a sloke.\"This measure now Válmíki choseWherein his story to compose.In hundreds of such verses, sweetWith equal lines and even feet,The saintly poet, lofty-souled,The glorious deeds of Ráma told.Canto III. The Argument.The hermit thus with watchful heedReceived the poem pregnant seed,And looked with eager thought aroundIf fuller knowledge might be found.His lips with water first bedewed,(51)He sate, in reverent attitudeOn holy grass,(52) the points all bentTogether toward the orient;(53)And thus in meditation heEntered the path of poesy.Then clearly, through his virtue might,All lay discovered to his sight,Whate\\'er befell, through all their life,Ráma, his brother, and his wife:And Dasaratha and each queenAt every time, in every scene:His people too, of every sort;The nobles of his princely court:Whate\\'er was said, whate\\'er decreed,Each time they sate each plan and deed:For holy thought and fervent riteHad so refined his keener sightThat by his sanctity his viewThe present, past, and future knew,And he with mental eye could grasp,Like fruit within his fingers clasp,The life of Ráma, great and good,Roaming with Sítá in the wood.He told, with secret-piercing eyes,The tale of Ráma high emprise,Each listening ear that shall entice,A sea of pearls of highest price.Thus good Válmíki, sage divine,Rehearsed the tale of Raghu line,As Nárad, heavenly saint, beforeHad traced the story outline o\\'er.He sang of Ráma princely birth,His kindness and heroic worth;His love for all, his patient youth,His gentleness and constant truth,And many a tale and legend oldBy holy Visvámitra told.How Janak child he wooed and won,And broke the bow that bent to none.How he with every virtue fraughtHis namesake Ráma(54) met and fought.The choice of Ráma for the throne;The malice by Kaikeyí shown,Whose evil counsel marred the planAnd drove him forth a banisht man.How the king grieved and groaned, and cried,And swooned away and pining died.The subjects\\' woe when thus bereft;And how the following crowds he left:With Guha talked, and firmly sternOrdered his driver to return.How Gangá farther shore he gained;By Bharadvája entertained,By whose advice he journeyed stillAnd came to Chitrakúta hill.How there he dwelt and built a cot;How Bharat journeyed to the spot;His earnest supplication made;Drink-offerings to their father paid;The sandals given by Ráma hand,As emblems of his right, to stand:How from his presence Bharat wentAnd years in Nandigráma spent.How Ráma entered Dandak woodAnd in Sutíkhna presence stood.The favour Anasúyá showed,The wondrous balsam she bestowed.How Sarabhanga dwelling-placeThey sought; saw Indra face to face;The meeting with Agastya gained;The heavenly bow from him obtained.How Ráma with Virádha met;Their home in Panchavata set.How Súrpanakhá underwentThe mockery and disfigurement.Of Trisirá and Khara fall,Of Rávan roused at vengeance call,Márícha doomed, without escape;The fair Videhan(55) lady rape.How Ráma wept and raved in vain,And how the Vulture-king was slain.How Ráma fierce Kabandha slew;Then to the side of Pampá drew,Met Hanumán, and her whose vowsWere kept beneath the greenwood boughs.How Raghu son, the lofty-souled,On Pampá bank wept uncontrolled,Then journeyed, Rishyamúk to reach,And of Sugríva then had speech.The friendship made, which both had sought:How Báli and Sugríva fought.How Báli in the strife was slain,And how Sugríva came to reign.The treaty, Tára wild lament;The rainy nights in watching spent.The wrath of Raghu lion son;The gathering of the hosts in one.The sending of the spies about,And all the regions pointed out.The ring by Ráma hand bestowed;The cave wherein the bear abode.The fast proposed, their lives to end;Sampati gained to be their friend.The scaling of the hill, the leapOf Hanumán across the deep.Ocean command that bade them seekMaináka of the lofty peak.The death of Sinhiká, the sightOf Lanká with her palace brightHow Hanumán stole in at eve;His plan the giants to deceive.How through the square he made his wayTo chambers where the women lay,Within the Asoka garden cameAnd there found Ráma captive dame.His colloquy with her he sought,And giving of the ring he brought.How Sítá gave a gem o\\'erjoyed;How Hanumán the grove destroyed.How giantesses trembling fled,And servant fiends were smitten dead.How Hanumán was seized;

The Rhapsodists.When to the end the tale was brought,Rose in the sage mind the thought;\"Now who throughout this earth will go,And tell it forth that all may know?\"As thus he mused with anxious breast,Behold, in hermit raiment dressed,Kusá and Lava(56) came to greetTheir master and embrace his feet.The twins he saw, that princely pairSweet-voiced, who dwelt beside him thereNone for the task could be more fit,For skilled were they in Holy Writ;And so the great Rámáyan, fraughtWith lore divine, to these he taught:The lay whose verses sweet and clearTake with delight the listening ear,That tell of Sítá noble lifeAnd Rávan fall in battle strife.Great joy to all who hear they bring,Sweet to recite and sweet to sing.For music sevenfold notes are there,And triple measure,(57) wrought with careWith melody and tone and time,And flavours(58) that enhance the rime;Heroic might has ample place,And loathing of the false and base,With anger, mirth, and terror, blentWith tenderness, surprise, content.When, half the hermit grace to gain,And half because they loved the strain,The youth within their hearts had storedThe poem that his lips outpoured,Válmíki kissed them on the head,As at his feet they bowed, and said;\"Recite ye this heroic songIn tranquil shades where sages throng:Recite it where the good resort,In lowly home and royal court.\"The hermit ceased. The tuneful pair,Like heavenly minstrels sweet and fair,In music art divinely skilled,Their saintly master word fulfilled.Like Ráma self, from whom they came,They showed their sire in face and frame,As though from some fair sculptured stoneTwo selfsame images had grown.Sometimes the pair rose up to sing,Surrounded by a holy ring,Where seated on the grass had metFull many a musing anchoret.Then tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,As transport took them and surprise,And as they listened every oneCried in delight, Well done! Well done!Those sages versed in holy lorePraised the sweet minstrels more and more:And wondered at the singers\\' skill,And the bard verses sweeter still,Which laid so clear before the eyeThe glorious deeds of days gone by.Thus by the virtuous hermits praised,Inspirited their voice they raised.Pleased with the song this holy manWould give the youths a water-can;One gave a fair ascetic dress,Or sweet fruit from the wilderness.One saint a black-deer hide would bring,And one a sacrificial string:One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,And one, a twisted munja cord.(59)One in his joy an axe would find,One braid, their plaited locks to bind.One gave a sacrificial cup,One rope to tie their fagots up;While fuel at their feet was laid,Or hermit stool of fig-tree made.All gave, or if they gave not, noneForgot at least a benison.Some saints, delighted with their lays,Would promise health and length of days;Others with surest words would addSome boon to make their spirit glad.In such degree of honour thenThat song was held by holy men:That living song which life can give,By which shall many a minstrel live.In seat of kings, in crowded hall,They sang the poem, praised of all.And Ráma chanced to hear their lay,While he the votive steed(60) would slay,And sent fit messengers to bringThe minstrel pair before the king.They came, and found the monarch highEnthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;While many a minister below,And noble, sate in lengthened row.The youthful pair awhile he viewedGraceful in modest attitude,And then in words like these addressedHis brother Lakshman and the rest:\"Come, listen to the wondrous strainRecited by these godlike twain,Sweet singers of a story fraughtWith melody and lofty thought.\"The pair, with voices sweet and strong,Rolled the full tide of noble song,With tone and accent deftly blentTo suit the changing argument.Mid that assembly loud and clearRang forth that lay so sweet to hear,That universal rapture stoleThrough each man frame and heart and soul.\"These minstrels, blest with every signThat marks a high and princely line,In holy shades who dwell,Enshrined in Saint Válmíki lay,A monument to live for aye,My deeds in song shall tell.\"Thus Ráma spoke: their breasts were fired,And the great tale, as if inspired,The youths began to sing,While every heart with transport swelled,And mute and rapt attention heldThe concourse and the king.Canto V. Ayodhyá.\"Ikshváku sons from days of oldWere ever brave and mighty-souled.The land their arms had made their ownWas bounded by the sea alone.Their holy works have won them praise,Through countless years, from Manu days.Their ancient sire was Sagar, heWhose high command dug out the sea:(61)With sixty thousand sons to throngAround him as he marched along.From them this glorious tale proceeds:The great Rámáyan tells their deeds.This noble song whose lines containLessons of duty, love, and gain,We two will now at length recite,While good men listen with delight.On Sarjú(62) bank, of ample size,The happy realm of Kosal lies,With fertile length of fair champaignAnd flocks and herds and wealth of grain.There, famous in her old renown,Ayodhyá(63) stands, the royal town,In bygone ages built and plannedBy sainted Manu(64) princely hand.Imperial seat! her walls extendTwelve measured leagues from end to end,And three in width from side to side,With square and palace beautified.Her gates at even distance stand;Her ample roads are wisely planned.Right glorious is her royal streetWhere streams allay the dust and heat.On level ground in even rowHer houses rise in goodly show:Terrace and palace, arch and gateThe queenly city decorate.High are her ramparts, strong and vast,By ways at even distance passed,With circling moat, both deep and wide,And store of weapons fortified.King Dasaratha, lofty-souled,That city guarded and controlled,With towering Sál trees belted round,(65)And many a grove and pleasure ground,As royal Indra, throned on high,Rules his fair city in the sky.(66)She seems a painted city, fairWith chess-board line and even square.(67)And cool boughs shade the lovely lakeWhere weary men their thirst may slake.There gilded chariots gleam and shine,And stately piles the Gods enshrine.There gay sleek people ever throngTo festival and dance and song.A mine is she of gems and sheen,The darling home of Fortune Queen.With noblest sort of drink and meat,The fairest rice and golden wheat,And fragrant with the chaplet scentWith holy oil and incense blent.With many an elephant and steed,And wains for draught and cars for speed.With envoys sent by distant kings,And merchants with their precious thingsWith banners o\\'er her roofs that play,And weapons that a hundred slay;(68)All warlike engines framed by man,And every class of artisan.A city rich beyond compareWith bards and minstrels gathered there,And men and damsels who entranceThe soul with play and song and dance.In every street is heard the lute,The drum, the tabret, and the flute,The Veda chanted soft and low,The ringing of the archer bow;With bands of godlike heroes skilledIn every warlike weapon, filled,And kept by warriors from the foe,As Nágas guard their home below.(69)There wisest Bráhmans evermoreThe flame of worship feed,And versed in all the Vedas\\' lore,Their lives of virtue lead.Truthful and pure, they freely give;They keep each sense controlled,And in their holy fervour liveLike the great saints of old.Canto VI. The King.There reigned a king of name revered,To country and to town endeared,Great Dasaratha, good and sage,Well read in Scripture holy page:Upon his kingdom weal intent,Mighty and brave and provident;The pride of old Ikshváku seedFor lofty thought and righteous deed.Peer of the saints, for virtues famed,For foes subdued and passions tamed:A rival in his wealth untoldOf Indra and the Lord of Gold.Like Manu first of kings, he reigned,And worthily his state maintained.For firm and just and ever trueLove, duty, gain he kept in view,And ruled his city rich and free,Like Indra Amarávatí.And worthy of so fair a placeThere dwelt a just and happy raceWith troops of children blest.Each man contented sought no more,Nor longed with envy for the storeBy richer friends possessed.For poverty was there unknown,And each man counted as his ownKine, steeds, and gold, and grain.All dressed in raiment bright and clean,And every townsman might be seenWith earrings, wreath, or chain.None deigned to feed on broken fare,And none was false or stingy there.A piece of gold, the smallest pay,Was earned by labour for a day.On every arm were bracelets worn,And none was faithless or forsworn,A braggart or unkind.None lived upon another wealth,None pined with dread or broken health,Or dark disease of mind.High-souled were all. The slanderous word,The boastful lie, were never heard.Each man was constant to his vows,And lived devoted to his spouse.No other love his fancy knew,And she was tender, kind, and true.Her dames were fair of form and face,With charm of wit and gentle grace,With modest raiment simply neat,And winning manners soft and sweet.The twice-born sages, whose delightWas Scripture page and holy rite,Their calm and settled course pursued,Nor sought the menial multitude.In many a Scripture each was versed,And each the flame of worship nursed,And gave with lavish hand.Each paid to Heaven the offerings due,And none was godless or untrueIn all that holy band.To Bráhmans, as the laws ordain,The Warrior caste were ever fainThe reverence due to pay;And these the Vaisyas\\' peaceful crowd,Who trade and toil for gain, were proudTo honour and obey;And all were by the Súdras(70) served,Who never from their duty swerved,Their proper worship all addressedTo Bráhman, spirits, God, and guest.Pure and unmixt their rites remained,Their race honour ne\\'er was stained.(71)Cheered by his grandsons, sons, and wife,Each passed a long and happy life.Thus was that famous city heldBy one who all his race excelled,Blest in his gentle reign,As the whole land aforetime swayedBy Manu, prince of men, obeyedHer king from main to main.And heroes kept her, strong and brave,As lions guard their mountain cave:Fierce as devouring flame they burned,And fought till death, but never turned.Horses had she of noblest breed,Like Indra for their form and speed,From Váhlí(72) hills and Sindhu(73) sand,Vanáyu(74) and Kámboja land.(75)Her noble elephants had strayedThrough Vindhyan and Himálayan shade,Gigantic in their bulk and height,Yet gentle in their matchless might.They rivalled well the world-spread fameOf the great stock from which they came,Of Váman, vast of size,Of Mahápadma glorious line,Thine, Anjan, and, Airávat, thine.(76)Upholders of the skies.With those, enrolled in fourfold class,Who all their mighty kin surpass,Whom men Matangas name,And Mrigas spotted black and white,And Bhadras of unwearied might,And Mandras hard to tame.(77)Thus, worthy of the name she bore,(78)Ayodhyá for a league or moreCast a bright glory round,Where Dasaratha wise and greatGoverned his fair ancestral state,With every virtue crowned.Like Indra in the skies he reignedIn that good town whose wall containedHigh domes and turrets proud,With gates and arcs of triumph decked,And sturdy barriers to protectHer gay and countless crowd.Canto VII. The Ministers.Two sages, holy saints, had he,His ministers and priests to be:Vasishtha, faithful to advise,And Vámadeva, Scripture-wise.Eight other lords around him stood,All skilled to counsel, wise and good:Jayanta, Vijay, Dhrishti boldIn fight, affairs of war controlled:Siddhárth and Arthasádhak trueWatched o\\'er expense and revenue,And Dharmapál and wise AsokOf right and law and justice spoke.With these the sage Sumantra, skilledTo urge the car, high station filled.All these in knowledge duly trainedEach passion and each sense restrained:With modest manners, nobly bredEach plan and nod and look they read,Upon their neighbours\\' good intent,Most active and benevolent:As sit the Vasus(79) round their king,They sate around him counselling.They ne\\'er in virtue loftier prideAnother lowly gifts decried.In fair and seemly garb arrayed,No weak uncertain plans they made.Well skilled in business, fair and just,They gained the people love and trust,And thus without oppression storedThe swelling treasury of their lord.Bound in sweet friendship each to each,They spoke kind thoughts in gentle speech.They looked alike with equal eyeOn every caste, on low and high.Devoted to their king, they sought,Ere his tongue spoke, to learn his thought,And knew, as each occasion rose,To hide their counsel or disclose.In foreign lands or in their ownWhatever passed, to them was known.By secret spies they timely knewWhat men were doing or would do.Skilled in the grounds of war and peaceThey saw the monarch state increase,Watching his weal with conquering eyeThat never let occasion by,While nature lent her aid to blessTheir labours with unbought success.Never for anger, lust, or gain,Would they their lips with falsehood stain.Inclined to mercy they could scanThe weakness and the strength of man.They fairly judged both high and low,And ne\\'er would wrong a guiltless foe;Yet if a fault were proved, each oneWould punish e\\'en his own dear son.But there and in the kingdom boundNo thief or man impure was found:None of loose life or evil fame,No tempter of another dame.Contented with their lot each casteCalm days in blissful quiet passed;And, all in fitting tasks employed,Country and town deep rest enjoyed,With these wise lords around his throneThe monarch justly reigned,And making every heart his ownThe love of all men gained.With trusty agents, as beseems,Each distant realm he scanned,As the sun visits with his beamsEach corner of the land.Ne\\'er would he on a mightier foeWith hostile troops advance,Nor at an equal strike a blowIn war delusive chance.These lords in council bore their partWith ready brain and faithful heart,With skill and knowledge, sense and tact,Good to advise and bold to act.And high and endless fame he wonWith these to guide his schemes,As, risen in his might, the sunWins glory with his beams.Canto VIII. Sumantra Speech.But splendid, just, and great of mind,The childless king for offspring pined.No son had he his name to grace,Transmitter of his royal race.Long had his anxious bosom wrought,And as he pondered rose the thought:\"A votive steed \\'twere good to slay,So might a son the gift repay.\"Before his lords his plan he laid,And bade them with their wisdom aid:Then with these words Sumantra, bestOf royal counsellors, addressed:\"Hither, Vasishtha at their head,Let all my priestly guides be led.\"To him Sumantra made reply:\"Hear, Sire, a tale of days gone by.To many a sage in time of old,Sanatkumár, the saint, foretoldHow from thine ancient line, O King,A son, when years came round, should spring.\"Here dwells,\" \\'twas thus the seer began,\"Of Kasyap(80) race, a holy man,Vibhándak named: to him shall springA son, the famous Rishyasring.Bred with the deer that round him roam,The wood shall be that hermit home.To him no mortal shall be knownExcept his holy sire alone.Still by those laws shall he abideWhich lives of youthful Bráhmans guide,Obedient to the strictest ruleThat forms the young ascetic school:And all the wondering world shall hearOf his stern life and penance drear;His care to nurse the holy fireAnd do the bidding of his sire.Then, seated on the Angas\\'(81) throne,Shall Lomapád to fame be known.But folly wrought by that great kingA plague upon the land shall bring;No rain for many a year shall fallAnd grievous drought shall ruin all.The troubled king with many a prayerShall bid the priests some cure declare:\"The lore of Heaven \\'tis yours to know,Nor are ye blind to things below:Declare, O holy men, the wayThis plague to expiate and stay.\"Those best of Bráhmans shall reply:\"By every art, O Monarch, tryHither to bring Vibhándak child,Persuaded, captured, or beguiled.And when the boy is hither ledTo him thy daughter duly wed.\"But how to bring that wondrous boyHis troubled thoughts will long employ,And hopeless to achieve the taskHe counsel of his lords will ask,And bid his priests and servants bringWith honour saintly Rishyasring.But when they hear the monarch speech,All these their master will beseech,With trembling hearts and looks of woe,To spare them, for they fear to go.And many a plan will they declareAnd crafty plots will frame,And promise fair to show him there,Unforced, with none to blame.On every word his lords shall say,The king will meditate,And on the third returning dayRecall them to debate.Then this shall be the plan agreed,That damsels shall be sentAttired in holy hermits\\' weed,And skilled in blandishment,That they the hermit may beguileWith every art and amorous wileWhose use they know so well,And by their witcheries seduceThe unsuspecting young recluseTo leave his father cell.Then when the boy with willing feetShall wander from his calm retreatAnd in that city stand,The troubles of the king shall end,And streams of blessed rain descendUpon the thirsty land.Thus shall the holy RishyasringTo Lomapád, the mighty king,By wedlock be allied;For Sántá, fairest of the fair,In mind and grace beyond compare,Shall be his royal bride.He, at the Offering of the Steed,The flames with holy oil shall feed,And for King Dasaratha gainSons whom his prayers have begged in vain.\"\"I have repeated, Sire, thus far,The words of old Sanatkumár,In order as he spoke them thenAmid the crowd of holy men.\"Then Dasaratha cried with joy,\"Say how they brought the hermit boy.\"Canto IX. Rishyasring.The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,Unfolded at the king behestThe plan the lords in council laidTo draw the hermit from the shade:\"The priest, amid the lordly crowd,To Lomapád thus spoke aloud:\"Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,A harmless trick by all unblamed.Far from the world that hermit childLives lonely in the distant wild:A stranger to the joys of sense,His bliss is pain and abstinence;And all unknown are women yetTo him, a holy anchoret.The gentle passions we will wakeThat with resistless influence shakeThe hearts of men; and heDrawn by enchantment strong and sweetShall follow from his lone retreat,And come and visit thee.Let ships be formed with utmost careThat artificial trees may bear,And sweet fruit deftly made;Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,And flowers, and many a bird be thereBeneath the leafy shade.Upon the ships thus decked a bandOf young and lovely girls shall stand,Rich in each charm that wakes desire,And eyes that burn with amorous fire;Well skilled to sing, and play, and danceAnd ply their trade with smile and glanceLet these, attired in hermits\\' dress,Betake them to the wilderness,And bring the boy of life austereA voluntary captive here.\"He ended; and the king agreed,By the priest counsel won.And all the ministers took heedTo see his bidding done.In ships with wondrous art preparedAway the lovely women fared,And soon beneath the shade they stoodOf the wild, lonely, dreary wood.And there the leafy cot they foundWhere dwelt the devotee,And looked with eager eyes aroundThe hermit son to see.Still, of Vibhándak sore afraid,They hid behind the creepers\\' shade.But when by careful watch they knewThe elder saint was far from view,With bolder steps they ventured nighTo catch the youthful hermit eye.Then all the damsels, blithe and gay,At various games began to play.They tossed the flying ball aboutWith dance and song and merry shout,And moved, their scented tresses boundWith wreaths, in mazy motion round.Some girls as if by love possessed,Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,Up starting quickly to pursueTheir intermitted game anew.It was a lovely sight to seeThose fair ones, as they played,While fragrant robes were floating free,And bracelets clashing in their gleeA pleasant tinkling made.The anklet chime, the Koďl(82) cryWith music filled the placeAs \\'twere some city in the skyWhich heavenly minstrels grace.With each voluptuous art they stroveTo win the tenant of the grove,And with their graceful forms inspireHis modest soul with soft desire.With arch of brow, with beck and smile,With every passion-waking wileOf glance and lotus hand,With all enticements that exciteThe longing for unknown delightWhich boys in vain withstand.Forth came the hermit son to viewThe wondrous sight to him so new,And gazed in rapt surprise,For from his natal hour till thenOn woman or the sons of menHe ne\\'er had cast his eyes.He saw them with their waists so slim,With fairest shape and faultless limb,In variegated robes arrayed,And sweetly singing as they played.Near and more near the hermit drew,And watched them at their game,And stronger still the impulse grewTo question whence they came.They marked the young ascetic gazeWith curious eye and wild amaze,And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,And shrill their merry laughter rang.Then came they nearer to his side,And languishing with passion cried:\"Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,Come suddenly to join us now?And why dost thou all lonely dwellIn the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,We wish to know thee, gentle youth;Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.\"He gazed upon that sight he ne\\'erHad seen before, of girls so fair,And out of love a longing roseHis sire and lineage to disclose:\"My father,\" thus he made reply,\"Is Kasyap son, a saint most high,Vibhándak styled; from him I came,And Rishyasring he calls my name.Our hermit cot is near this place:Come thither, O ye fair of face;There be it mine, with honour due,Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.\"They heard his speech, and gave consent,And gladly to his cottage went.Vibhándak son received them wellBeneath the shelter of his cellWith guest-gift, water for their feet,And woodland fruit and roots to eat,They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,Delighted with his courtesies:\"We too have goodly fruit in store,Grown on the trees that shade our door;Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, hasteThe produce of our grove to taste;And let, O good Ascetic, firstThis holy water quench thy thirst.\"They spoke, and gave him comfits sweetPrepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;And many a dainty cate besideAnd luscious mead their stores supplied.The seeming fruits, in taste and look,The unsuspecting hermit took,For, strange to him, their form beguiledThe dweller in the lonely wild.Then round his neck fair arms were flung,And there the laughing damsels clung,And pressing nearer and more nearWith sweet lips whispered at his ear;While rounded limb and swelling breastThe youthful hermit softly pressed.The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,The touch of a tender limb,Over his yielding spirit stoleAnd sweetly vanquished him.But vows, they said, must now be paid;They bade the boy farewell,And, of the aged saint afraid,Prepared to leave the dell.With ready guile they told him whereTheir hermit dwelling lay:Then, lest the sire should find them there,Sped by wild paths away.They fled and left him there aloneBy longing love possessed;And with a heart no more his ownHe roamed about distressed.The aged saint came home, to findThe hermit boy distraught,Revolving in his troubled mindOne solitary thought.\"Why dost thou not, my son,\" he cried,\"Thy due obeisance pay?Why do I see thee in the tideOf whelming thought to-day?A devotee should never wearA mien so sad and strange.Come, quickly, dearest child, declareThe reason of the change.\"And Rishyasring, when questioned thus,Made answer in this wise:\"O sire, there came to visit usSome men with lovely eyes.About my neck soft arms they woundAnd kept me tightly heldTo tender breasts so soft and round,That strangely heaved and swelled.They sing more sweetly as they danceThan e\\'er I heard till now,And play with many a sidelong glanceAnd arching of the brow.\"\"My son,\" said he, \"thus giants roamWhere holy hermits are,And wander round their peaceful homeTheir rites austere to mar.I charge thee, thou must never layThy trust in them, dear boy:They seek thee only to betray,And woo but to destroy.\"Thus having warned him of his foesThat night at home he spent.And when the morrow sun aroseForth to the forest went.But Rishyasring with eager paceSped forth and hurried to the placeWhere he those visitants had seenOf daintly waist and charming mien.When from afar they saw the sonOf Saint Vibhándak toward them run,To meet the hermit boy they hied,And hailed him with a smile, and cried:\"O come, we pray, dear lord, beholdOur lovely home of which we toldDue honour there to thee we\\'ll pay,And speed thee on thy homeward way.\"Pleased with the gracious words they saidHe followed where the damsels led.As with his guides his steps he bent,That Bráhman high of worth,A flood of rain from heaven was sentThat gladdened all the earth.Vibhándak took his homeward road,And wearied by the heavy loadOf roots and woodland fruit he boreEntered at last his cottage door.Fain for his son he looked around,But desolate the cell he found.He stayed not then to bathe his feet,Though fainting with the toil and heat,But hurried forth and roamed aboutCalling the boy with cry and shout,He searched the wood, but all in vain;Nor tidings of his son could gain.One day beyond the forest boundThe wandering saint a village found,And asked the swains and neatherds thereWho owned the land so rich and fair,With all the hamlets of the plain,And herds of kine and fields of grain.They listened to the hermit words,And all the guardians of the herds,With suppliant hands together pressed,This answer to the saint addressed:\"The Angas\\' lord who bears the nameOf Lomapád, renowned by fame,Bestowed these hamlets with their kineAnd all their riches, as a signOf grace, on Rishyasring: and heVibhándak son is said to be.\"The hermit with exulting breastThe mighty will of fate confessed,By meditation eye discerned;And cheerful to his home returned.A stately ship, at early morn,The hermit son away had borne.Loud roared the clouds, as on he sped,The sky grew blacker overhead;Till, as he reached the royal town,A mighty flood of rain came down.By the great rain the monarch mindThe coming of his guest divined.To meet the honoured youth he went,And low to earth his head he bent.With his own priest to lead the train,He gave the gift high guests obtain.And sought, with all who dwelt withinThe city walls, his grace to win.He fed him with the daintiest fare,He served him with unceasing care,And ministered with anxious eyesLest anger in his breast should rise;And gave to be the Bráhman brideHis own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.Thus loved and honoured by the king,The glorious Bráhman RishyasringPassed in that royal town his lifeWith Sántá his beloved wife.\"Canto X. Rishyasring Invited.\"Again, O best of kings, give ear:My saving words attentive hear,And listen to the tale of oldBy that illustrious Bráhman told.\"Of famed Ikshváku line shall spring(\\'Twas thus he spoke) a pious king,Named Dasaratha, good and great,True to his word and fortunate.He with the Angas\\' mighty lordShall ever live in sweet accord,And his a daughter fair shall be,Sántá of happy destiny.But Lomapád, the Angas\\' chief,Still pining in his childless grief,To Dasaratha thus shall say:\"Give me thy daughter, friend, I pray,Thy Sántá of the tranquil mind,The noblest one of womankind.\"The father, swift to feel for woe,Shall on his friend his child bestow;And he shall take her and departTo his own town with joyous heart.The maiden home in triumph led,To Rishyasring the king shall wed.And he with loving joy and prideShall take her for his honoured bride.And Dasaratha to a riteThat best of Bráhmans shall inviteWith supplicating prayer,To celebrate the sacrificeTo win him sons and Paradise,(83)That he will fain prepare.From him the lord of men at lengthThe boon he seeks shall gain,And see four sons of boundless strengthHis royal line maintain.\"\"Thus did the godlike saint of oldThe will of fate declare,And all that should befall unfoldAmid the sages there.O Prince supreme of men, go thou,Consult thy holy guide,And win, to aid thee in thy vow,This Bráhman to thy side.\"Sumantra counsel, wise and good,King Dasaratha heard,Then by Vasishtha side he stoodAnd thus with him conferred:\"Sumantra counsels thus: do thouMy priestly guide, the plan allow.\"Vasishtha gave his glad consent,And forth the happy monarch wentWith lords and servants on the roadThat led to Rishyasring abode.Forests and rivers duly past,He reached the distant town at lastOf Lomapád the Angas\\' king,And entered it with welcoming.On through the crowded streets he came,And, radiant as the kindled flame,He saw within the monarch houseThe hermit son most glorious.There Lomapád, with joyful breast,To him all honour paid,For friendship for his royal guestHis faithful bosom swayed.Thus entertained with utmost careSeven days, or eight, he tarried there,And then that best of men thus brokeHis purpose to the king, and spoke:\"O King of men, mine ancient friend,(Thus Dasaratha prayed)Thy Sántá with her husband sendMy sacrifice to aid.\"Said he who ruled the Angas, Yea,And his consent was won:And then at once he turned awayTo warn the hermit son.He told him of their ties beyondTheir old affection faithful bond:\"This king,\" he said, \"from days of oldA well beloved friend I hold.To me this pearl of dames he gaveFrom childless woe mine age to save,The daughter whom he loved so much,Moved by compassion gentle touch.In him thy Sántás father see:As I am even so is he.For sons the childless monarch yearns:To thee alone for help he turns.Go thou, the sacred rite ordainTo win the sons he prays to gain:Go, with thy wife thy succour lend,And give his vows a blissful end.\"The hermit son with quick accordObeyed the Angas\\' mighty lord,And with fair Sántá at his sideTo Dasaratha city hied.Each king, with suppliant hands upheld,Gazed on the other face:And then by mutual love impelledMet in a close embrace.Then Dasaratha thoughtful care,Before he parted thence,Bade trusty servants homeward bearThe glad intelligence:\"Let all the town be bright and gayWith burning incense sweet;Let banners wave, and water layThe dust in every street.\"Glad were the citizens to learnThe tidings of their lord return,And through the city every manObediently his task began.And fair and bright Ayodhyá showed,As following his guest he rodeThrough the full streets where shell and drumProclaimed aloud the king was come.And all the people with delightKept gazing on their king,Attended by that youth so bright,The glorious Rishyasring.When to his home the king had broughtThe hermit saintly son,He deemed that all his task was wrought,And all he prayed for won.And lords who saw that stranger dameSo beautiful to view,Rejoiced within their hearts, and cameAnd paid her honour too.There Rishyasring passed blissful days,Graced like the king with love and praiseAnd shone in glorious light with her,Sweet Sántá, for his minister,As Brahmá son Vasishtha, heWho wedded Saint Arundhatí.(84)Canto XI. The Sacrifice Decreed.The Dewy Season(85) came and went;The spring returned again:Then would the king, with mind intent,His sacrifice ordain.He came to Rishyasring, and bowedTo him of look divine,And bade him aid his offering vowedFor heirs, to save his line.Nor would the youth his aid deny:He spake the monarch fair,And prayed him for that rite so highAll requisites prepare.The king to wise Sumantra criedWho stood aye ready near;\"Go summon quick each holy guide,To counsel and to hear.\"Obedient to his lord behestAway Sumantra sped,And brought Vasishtha and the rest,In Scripture deeply read.Suyajna, Vámadeva came,Jávali, Kasyap son,And old Vasishtha, dear to fame,Obedient every one.King Dasaratha met them thereAnd duly honoured each,And spoke in pleasant words his fairAnd salutary speech:\"In childless longing doomed to pine,No happiness, O lords, is mine.So have I for this cause decreedTo slay the sacrificial steed.Fain would I pay that offering highWherein the horse is doomed to die,With Rishyasring his aid to lend,And with your glory to befriend.\"With loud applause each holy manReceived his speech, approved the plan,And, by the wise Vasishtha led,Gave praises to the king, and said:\"The sons thou cravest shalt thou see,Of fairest glory, born to thee,Whose holy feelings bid thee takeThis righteous course for offspring sake.\"Cheered by the ready praise of thoseWhose aid he sought, his spirits rose,And thus the king his speech renewedWith looks of joy and gratitude:\"Let what the coming rites requireBe ready as the priests desire,And let the horse, ordained to bleed,With fitting guard and priest, be freed,(86)Yonder on Sarjú northern sideThe sacrificial ground provide;And let the saving rites, that naughtIll-omened may occur, be wrought.The offering I announce to-dayEach lord of earth may claim to pay,Provided that his care can guardThe holy rite by flaws unmarred.For wandering fiends, whose watchful spiteWaits eagerly to spoil each rite,Hunting with keenest eye detectThe slightest slip, the least neglect;And when the sacred work is crossedThe workman is that moment lost.Let preparation due be made:Your powers the charge can meet:That so the noble rite be paidIn every point complete.\"And all the Bráhmans answered, Yea,His mandate honouring,And gladly promised to obeyThe order of the king.They cried with voices raised aloud:\"Success attend thine aim!\"Then bade farewell, and lowly bowed,And hastened whence they came.King Dasaratha went within,His well loved wives to see:And said: \"Your lustral rites begin,For these shall prosper me.A glorious offering I prepareThat precious fruit of sons may bear.\"Their lily faces brightened fastThose pleasant words to hear,As lilies, when the winter past,In lovelier hues appear.Canto XII. The Sacrifice Begun.Again the spring with genial heatReturning made the year complete.To win him sons, without delayHis vow the king resolved to pay:And to Vasishtha, saintly man,In modest words this speech began:\"Prepare the rite with all things fitAs is ordained in Holy Writ,And keep with utmost care afarWhate\\'er its sacred forms might mar.Thou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,Kind-hearted, and my friend beside;So is it meet thou undertakeThis heavy task for duty sake.\"Then he, of twice-born men the best,His glad assent at once expressed:\"Fain will I do whate\\'er may beDesired, O honoured King, by thee.\"To ancient priests he spoke, who, trainedIn holy rites, deep skill had gained:\"Here guards be stationed, good and sageReligious men of trusted age.And various workmen send and call,Who frame the door and build the wall:With men of every art and trade,Who read the stars and ply the spade,And mimes and minstrels hither bring,And damsels trained to dance and sing.\"Then to the learned men he said,In many a page of Scripture read:\"Be yours each rite performed to seeAccording to the king decree.And stranger Bráhmans quickly callTo this great rite that welcomes all.Pavilions for the princes, deckedWith art and ornament, erect,And handsome booths by thousands madeThe Bráhman visitors to shade,Arranged in order side by side,With meat and drink and all supplied.And ample stables we shall needFor many an elephant and steed:And chambers where the men may lie,And vast apartments, broad and high,Fit to receive the countless bandsOf warriors come from distant lands.For our own people too provideSufficient tents, extended wide,And stores of meat and drink prepare,And all that can be needed there.And food in plenty must be foundFor guests from all the country round.Of various viands presents make,For honour, not for pity sake,That fit regard and worship bePaid to each caste in due degree.And let not wish or wrath exciteYour hearts the meanest guest to slight;But still observe with special graceThose who obtain the foremost place,Whether for happier skill in artOr bearing in the rite their part.Do you, I pray, with friendly mindPerform the task to you assigned,And work the rite, as bids the law,Without omission, slip, or flaw\"They answered: \"As thou seest fitSo will we do and naught omit.\"The sage Vasistha then addressedSumantra called at his behest:\"The princes of the earth invite,And famous lords who guard the rite,Priest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,In countless thousands summon all.Where\\'er their home be, far or near,Gather the good with honour here,And Janak, whose imperial swayThe men of Míthilá(87) obey.The firm of vow, the dread of foes,Who all the lore of Scripture knows,Invite him here with honour high,King Dasaratha old ally.And Kási(88) lord of gentle speech,Who finds a pleasant word for each,In length of days our monarch peer,Illustrious king, invite him here.The father of our ruler bride,Known for his virtues far and wide,The king whom Kekaya(89) realms obey,Him with his son invite, I pray.And Lomapád the Angas\\' king,True to his vows and godlike, bring.For be thine invitations sentTo west and south and orient.Call those who rule Suráshtra(90) land,Suvíra(91) realm and Sindhu strand,And all the kings of earth besideIn friendship bonds with us allied:Invite them all to hasten inWith retinue and kith and kin.\"Vasishtha speech without delaySumantra bent him to obey.And sent his trusty envoys forthEastward and westward, south and north.Obedient to the saint requestHimself he hurried forth, and pressedEach nobler chief and lord and kingTo hasten to the gathering.Before the saint Vasishtha stoodAll those who wrought with stone and wood,And showed the work which every oneIn furtherance of the rite had done,Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,Thus to the craftsmen all said he:\"I charge ye, masters, see to this,That there be nothing done amiss,And this, I pray, in mind be borne,That not one gift ye give in scorn:Whenever scorn a gift attendsGreat sin is his who thus offends.\"And now some days and nights had past,And kings began to gather fast,And precious gems in liberal storeAs gifts to Dasaratha bore.Then joy thrilled through Vasishtha breastAs thus the monarch he addressed:\"Obedient to thy high decreeThe kings, my lord, are come to thee.And it has been my care to greetAnd honour all with reverence meet.Thy servants\\' task is ended quite,And all is ready for the rite.Come forth then to the sacred groundWhere all in order will be found.\"Then Rishyasring confirmed the tale:Nor did their words to move him fail.The stars propitious influence lentWhen forth the world great ruler went.Then by the sage Vasishtha ledThe priest begun to speedThose glorious rites wherein is shedThe lifeblood of the steed.Canto XIII. The Sacrifice Finished.The circling year had filled its course,And back was brought the wandering horse:Then upon Sarjú northern strandBegan the rite the king had planned.With Rishyasring the forms to guide,The Bráhmans to their task applied,At that great offering of the steedTheir lofty-minded king decreed.The priests, who all the Scripture knew,Performed their part in order due,And circled round in solemn trainAs precepts of the law ordain.Pravargya rites(92) were duly sped:For Upasads(93) the flames were fed.Then from the plant(94) the juice was squeezed,And those high saints with minds well pleasedPerformed the mystic rites begunWith bathing ere the rise of sunThey gave the portion Indra claim,And hymned the King whom none can blame.The mid-day bathing followed next,Observed as bids the holy text.Then the good priests with utmost care,In form that Scripture rules declare,For the third time pure water shedOn high souled Dasaratha head.Then Rishyasring and all the restTo Indra and the Gods addressedTheir sweet-toned hymn of praise and prayer,And called them in the rite to share.With sweetest song and hymn entonedThey gave the Gods in heaven enthroned,As duty bids, the gifts they claim,The holy oil that feeds the flame.And many an offering there was paid,And not one slip in all was made.For with most careful heed they sawThat all was done by Veda law.None, all those days, was seen oppressedBy hunger or by toil distressed.Why speak of human kind? No beastWas there that lacked an ample feast.For there was store for all who came,For orphan child and lonely dame;The old and young were well supplied,The poor and hungry satisfied.Throughout the day ascetics fed,And those who roam to beg their bread:While all around the cry was still,\"Give forth, give forth,\" and \"Eat your fill.\"\"Give forth with liberal hand the meal,And various robes in largess deal.\"Urged by these cries on every sideUnweariedly their task they plied:And heaps of food like hills in sizeIn boundless plenty met the eyes:And lakes of sauce, each day renewed,Refreshed the weary multitude.And strangers there from distant lands,And women folk in crowded bandsThe best of food and drink obtainedAt the great rite the king ordained.Apart from all, the Bráhmans there,Thousands on thousands, took their shareOf various dainties sweet to taste,On plates of gold and silver placed,All ready set, as, when they willed,The twice-born men their places filled.And servants in fair garments dressedWaited upon each Bráhman guest.Of cheerful mind and mien were they,With gold and jewelled earrings gay.The best of Bráhmans praised the fareOf countless sorts, of flavour rare:And thus to Raghu son they cried:\"We bless thee, and are satisfied.\"Between the rites some Bráhmans spentThe time in learned argument,With ready flow of speech, sedate,And keen to vanquish in debate.(95)There day by day the holy trainPerformed all rites as rules ordain.No priest in all that host was foundBut kept the vows that held him bound:None, but the holy Vedas knew,And all their six-fold science(96) too.No Bráhman there was found unfitTo speak with eloquence and wit.And now the appointed time came nearThe sacrificial posts to rear.They brought them, and prepared to fixOf Bel(97) and Khádir(98) six and six;Six, made of the Palása(99) tree,Of Fig-wood one, apart to be:Of Sleshmát(100) and of Devadár(101)One column each, the mightiest far:So thick the two, the arms of manTheir ample girth would fail to span.All these with utmost care were wroughtBy hand of priests in Scripture taught,And all with gold were gilded brightTo add new splendour to the rite:Twenty-and-one those stakes in all,Each one-and-twenty cubits tall:And one-and-twenty ribbons thereHung on the pillars, bright and fair.Firm in the earth they stood at last,Where cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;And there unshaken each remained,Octagonal and smoothly planed.Then ribbons over all were hung,And flowers and scent around them flung.Thus decked they cast a glory forthLike the great saints who star the north.(102)The sacrificial altar thenWas raised by skilful twice-born men,In shape and figure to beholdAn eagle with his wings of gold,With twice nine pits and formed three-foldEach for some special God, besideThe pillars were the victims tied;The birds that roam the wood, the air,The water, and the land were there,And snakes and things of reptile birth,And healing herbs that spring from earth:As texts prescribe, in Scripture found,Three hundred victims there were bound.The steed devoted to the hostOf Gods, the gem they honour most,Was duly sprinkled. Then the QueenKausalyá, with delighted mien,With reverent steps around him paced,And with sweet wreaths the victim graced;Then with three swords in order dueShe smote the steed with joy, and slew.That night the queen, a son to gain,With calm and steady heart was fainBy the dead charger side to stayFrom evening till the break of day.Then came three priests, their care to leadThe other queens to touch the steed,Upon Kausalyá to attend,Their company and aid to lend.As by the horse she still reclined,With happy mien and cheerful mind,With Rishyasring the twice-born cameAnd praised and blessed the royal dame.The priest who well his duty knew,And every sense could well subdue,From out the bony chambers freedAnd boiled the marrow of the steed.Above the steam the monarch bent,And, as he smelt the fragrant scent,In time and order drove afarAll error that his hopes could mar.Then sixteen priests together cameAnd cast into the sacred flameThe severed members of the horse,Made ready all in ordered course.On piles of holy Fig-tree raisedThe meaner victims\\' bodies blazed:The steed, of all the creatures slain,Alone required a pile of cane.Three days, as is by law decreed,Lasted that Offering of the Steed.The Chatushtom began the rite,And when the sun renewed his light,The Ukthya followed: after cameThe Atirátra holy flame.These were the rites, and many moreArranged by light of holy lore,The Aptoryám of mighty power,And, each performed in proper hour,The Abhijit and VisvajitWith every form and service fit;And with the sacrifice at nightThe Jyotishtom and Áyus rite.(103)The task was done, as laws prescribe:The monarch, glory of his tribe,Bestowed the land in liberal grantsUpon the sacred ministrants.He gave the region of the east,His conquest, to the Hotri priest.The west, the celebrant obtained:The south, the priest presiding gained:The northern region was the shareOf him who chanted forth the prayer,(104)Thus did each priest obtain his meedAt the great Slaughter of the Steed,Ordained, the best of all to be,By self-existent deity.Ikshváku son with joyful mindThis noble fee to each assigned,But all the priests with one accordAddressed that unpolluted lord:\"Tis thine alone to keep the wholeOf this broad earth in firm control.No gift of lands from thee we seek:To guard these realms our hands were weak.On sacred lore our days are spent:Let other gifts our wants content.\"The chief of old Ikshváku lineGave them ten hundred thousand kine,A hundred millions of fine gold,The same in silver four times told.But every priest in presence thereWith one accord resigned his share.To Saint Vasishtha, high of soul,And Rishyasring they gave the whole.That largess pleased those Bráhmans well,Who bade the prince his wishes tell.Then Dasaratha, mighty king,Made answer thus to Rishyasring:\"O holy Hermit, of thy grace,Vouchsafe the increase of my race.\"He spoke; nor was his prayer denied:The best of Bráhmans thus replied:\"Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,Upholders of thy royal line.\"Canto XIV. Rávan Doomed.The saint, well read in holy lore,Pondered awhile his answer o\\'er,And thus again addressed the king,His wandering thoughts regathering:\"Another rite will I beginWhich shall the sons thou cravest win,Where all things shall be duly spedAnd first Atharva texts be read.\"Then by Vibhándak gentle sonWas that high sacrifice begun,The king advantage seeking stillAnd zealous to perform his will.Now all the Gods had gathered there,Each one for his allotted share:Brahmá, the ruler of the sky,Sthánu, Náráyan, Lord most high,And holy Indra men might viewWith Maruts(105) for his retinue;The heavenly chorister, and saint,And spirit pure from earthly taint,With one accord had sought the placeThe high-souled monarch rite to grace.Then to the Gods who came to takeTheir proper share the hermit spake:\"For you has Dasaratha slainThe votive steed, a son to gain;Stern penance-rites the king has tried,And in firm faith on you relied,And now with undiminished careA second rite would fain prepare.But, O ye Gods, consent to grantThe longing of your supplicant.For him beseeching hands I lift,And pray you all to grant the gift,That four fair sons of high renownThe offerings of the king may crown.\"They to the hermit son replied:\"His longing shall be gratified.For, Bráhman, in most high degreeWe love the king and honour thee.\"These words the Gods in answer said,And vanished thence by Indra led.Thus to the Lord, the worlds who made,The Immortals all assembled prayed:\"O Brahmá, mighty by thy grace,Rávan, who rules the giant race,Torments us in his senseless pride,And penance-loving saints beside.For thou well pleased in days of oldGavest the boon that makes him bold,That God nor demon e\\'er should killHis charmed life, for so thy will.We, honouring that high behest,Bear all his rage though sore distressed.That lord of giants fierce and fellScourges the earth and heaven and hell.Mad with thy boon, his impious rageSmites saint and bard and God and sage.The sun himself withholds his glow,The wind in fear forbears to blow;The fire restrains his wonted heatWhere stand the dreaded Rávan feet,And, necklaced with the wandering wave,The sea before him fears to rave.Kuvera self in sad defeatIs driven from his blissful seat.We see, we feel the giant might,And woe comes o\\'er us and affright.To thee, O Lord, thy suppliants prayTo find some cure this plague to stay.\"Thus by the gathered Gods addressedHe pondered in his secret breast,And said: \"One only way I findTo slay this fiend of evil mind.He prayed me once his life to guardFrom demon, God, and heavenly bard,And spirits of the earth and air,And I consenting heard his prayer.But the proud giant in his scornRecked not of man of woman born.None else may take his life away,But only man the fiend may slay.\"The Gods, with Indra at their head,Rejoiced to hear the words he said.Then crowned with glory like a flame,Lord Vishnu to the council came;His hands shell, mace, and discus bore,And saffron were the robes he wore.Riding his eagle through the crowd,As the sun rides upon a cloud,With bracelets of fine gold, he cameLoud welcomed by the Gods\\' acclaim.His praise they sang with one consent,And cried, in lowly reverence bent:\"O Lord whose hand fierce Madhu(106) slew,Be thou our refuge, firm and true;Friend of the suffering worlds art thou,We pray thee help thy suppliants now.\"Then Vishnu spake: \"Ye Gods, declare,What may I do to grant your prayer?\"\"King Dasaratha,\" thus cried they,\"Fervent in penance many a day,The sacrificial steed has slain,Longing for sons, but all in vain.Now, at the cry of us forlorn,Incarnate as his seed be born.Three queens has he: each lovely dameLike Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.Divide thyself in four, and beHis offspring by these noble three.Man nature take, and slay in fightRávan who laughs at heavenly might:This common scourge, this rankling thornWhom the three worlds too long have borneFor Rávan in the senseless prideOf might unequalled has defiedThe host of heaven, and plagues with woeAngel and bard and saint below,Crushing each spirit and each maidWho plays in Nandan(107) heavenly shade.O conquering Lord, to thee we bow;Our surest hope and trust art thou.Regard the world of men below,And slay the Gods\\' tremendous foe.\"When thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,His wise reply Náráyan(108) made:\"What task demands my presence there,And whence this dread, ye Gods declare.\"The Gods replied: \"We fear, O Lord,Fierce Rávan, ravener abhorred.Be thine the glorious task, we pray,In human form this fiend to slay.By thee of all the Blest aloneThis sinner may be overthrown.He gained by penance long and direThe favour of the mighty Sire.Then He who every gift bestowsGuarded the fiend from heavenly foes,And gave a pledge his life that keptFrom all things living, man except.On him thus armed no other foeThan man may deal the deadly blow.Assume, O King, a mortal birth,And strike the demon to the earth.\"Then Vishnu, God of Gods, the LordSupreme by all the worlds adored,To Brahmá and the suppliants spake:\"Dismiss your fear: for your dear sakeIn battle will I smite him dead,The cruel fiend, the Immortal dread.And lords and ministers and allHis kith and kin with him shall fall.Then, in the world of mortal men,Ten thousand years and hundreds tenI as a human king will reign,And guard the earth as my domain.\"God, saint, and nymph, and minstrel throngWith heavenly voices raised their songIn hymns of triumph to the GodWhose conquering feet on Madhu trod:\"Champion of Gods, as man appear,This cruel Rávan slay,The thorn that saints and hermits fear,The plague that none can stay.In savage fury uncontrolledHis pride for ever grows:He dares the Lord of Gods to holdAmong his deadly foes.\"Canto XV. The Nectar.When wisest Vishnu thus had givenHis promise to the Gods of heaven,He pondered in his secret mindA suited place of birth to find,Then he decreed, the lotus-eyed,In four his being to divide,And Dasaratha, gracious king,He chose as sire from whom to spring.That childless prince of high renown,Who smote in war his foemen down,At that same time with utmost carePrepared the rite that wins an heir.(109)Then Vishnu, fain on earth to dwell,Bade the Almighty Sire farewell,And vanished while a reverent crowdOf Gods and saints in worship bowed.The monarch watched the sacred rite,When a vast form of awful might,Of matchless splendour, strength, and sizeWas manifest before his eyes.From forth the sacrificial flame,Dark, robed in red, the being came.His voice was drumlike, loud and low,His face suffused with rosy glow.Like a huge lion mane appearedThe long locks of his hair and beard.He shone with many a lucky sign,And many an ornament divine;A towering mountain in his height,A tiger in his gait and might.No precious mine more rich could be,No burning flame more bright than he.His arms embraced in loving hold,Like a dear wife, a vase of goldWhose silver lining held a draughtOf nectar as in heaven is quaffed:A vase so vast, so bright to view,They scarce could count the vision true.Upon the king his eyes he bent,And said: \"The Lord of life has sentHis servant down, O Prince, to beA messenger from heaven to thee.\"The king with all his nobles byRaised reverent hands and made reply:\"Welcome, O glorious being! SayHow can my care thy grace repay.\"Envoy of Him whom all adoreThus to the king he spake once more:\"The Gods accept thy worship: theyGive thee the blessed fruit to-day.Approach and take, O glorious King,This heavenly nectar which I bring,For it shall give thee sons and wealth,And bless thee with a store of health.Give it to those fair queens of thine,And bid them quaff the drink divine:And they the princely sons shall bearLong sought by sacrifice and prayer.\"\"Yea, O my lord,\" the monarch said,And took the vase upon his head,The gift of Gods, of fine gold wrought,With store of heavenly liquor fraught.He honoured, filled with transport new,That wondrous being, fair to view,As round the envoy of the GodWith reverential steps he trod.(110)His errand done, that form of lightArose and vanished from the sight.High rapture filled the monarch soul,Possessed of that celestial bowl,As when a man by want distressedWith unexpected wealth is blest.And rays of transport seemed to fallIlluminating bower and hall,As when the autumn moon rides high,And floods with lovely light the sky.Quick to the ladies\\' bower he sped,And thus to Queen Kausalyá said:\"This genial nectar take and quaff,\"He spoke, and gave the lady half.Part of the nectar that remainedSumitrá from his hand obtained.He gave, to make her fruitful too,Kaikeyí half the residue.A portion yet remaining there,He paused awhile to think.Then gave Sumitrá, with her share.The remnant of the drink.Thus on each queen of those fair threeA part the king bestowed,And with sweet hope a child to seeTheir yearning bosoms glowed.The heavenly bowl the king suppliedTheir longing souls relieved,And soon, with rapture and with pride,Each royal dame conceived.He gazed upon each lady face,And triumphed as he gazed,As Indra in his royal placeBy Gods and spirits praised.Canto XVI. The Vánars.When Vishnu thus had gone on earth,From the great king to take his birth,The self-existent Lord of allAddressed the Gods who heard his call:\"For Vishnu sake, the strong and true,Who seeks the good of all of you,Make helps, in war to lend him aid,In forms that change at will, arrayed,Of wizard skill and hero might,Outstrippers of the wind in flight,Skilled in the arts of counsel, wise,And Vishnu peers in bold emprise;With heavenly arts and prudence fraught,By no devices to be caught;Skilled in all weapon lore and useAs they who drink the immortal juice.(111)And let the nymphs supreme in grace,And maidens of the minstrel race,Monkeys and snakes, and those who roveFree spirits of the hill and grove,And wandering Daughters of the Air,In monkey form brave children bear.So erst the lord of bears I shaped,Born from my mouth as wide I gaped.\"Thus by the mighty Sire addressedThey all obeyed his high behest,And thus begot in countless swarmsBrave sons disguised in sylvan forms.Each God, each sage became a sire,Each minstrel of the heavenly quire,(112)Each faun,(113) of children strong and goodWhose feet should roam the hill and wood.Snakes, bards,(114) and spirits,(115) serpents boldHad sons too numerous to be told.Báli, the woodland hosts who led,High as Mahendra(116) lofty head,Was Indra child. That noblest fire,The Sun, was great Sugríva sire,Tára, the mighty monkey, heWas offspring of Vrihaspati:(117)Tára the matchless chieftain, boastFor wisdom of the Vánar host.Of Gandhamádan brave and boldThe father was the Lord of Gold.Nala the mighty, dear to fame,Of skilful Visvakarmá(118) came.From Agni,(119) Nila bright as flame,Who in his splendour, might, and worth,Surpassed the sire who gave him birth.The heavenly Asvins,(120) swift and fair,Were fathers of a noble pair,Who, Dwivida and Mainda named,For beauty like their sires were famed,Varun(121) was father of Sushen,Of Sarabh, he who sends the rain,(122)Hanúmán, best of monkey kind,Was son of him who breathes the wind:Like thunderbolt in frame was he,And swift as Garud(123) self could flee.These thousands did the Gods createEndowed with might that none could mate,In monkey forms that changed at will;So strong their wish the fiend to kill.In mountain size, like lions thewed,Up sprang the wondrous multitude,Auxiliar hosts in every shape,Monkey and bear and highland ape.In each the strength, the might, the mienOf his own parent God were seen.Some chiefs of Vánar mothers came,Some of she-bear and minstrel dame,Skilled in all arms in battle shock;The brandished tree, the loosened rock;And prompt, should other weapons fail,To fight and slay with tooth and nail.Their strength could shake the hills amain,And rend the rooted trees in twain,Disturb with their impetuous sweepThe Rivers\\' Lord, the Ocean deep,Rend with their feet the seated ground,And pass wide floods with airy bound,Or forcing through the sky their wayThe very clouds by force could stay.Mad elephants that wander throughThe forest wilds, could they subdue,And with their furious shout could scareDead upon earth the birds of air.So were the sylvan chieftains formed;Thousands on thousands still they swarmed.These were the leaders honoured most,The captains of the Vánar host,And to each lord and chief and guideWas monkey offspring born beside.Then by the bears\\' great monarch stoodThe other roamers of the wood,And turned, their pathless homes to seek,To forest and to mountain peak.The leaders of the monkey bandBy the two brothers took their stand,Sugríva, offspring of the SunAnd Báli, Indra mighty one.They both endowed with Garud might,And skilled in all the arts of fight,Wandered in arms the forest through,And lions, snakes, and tigers, slew.But every monkey, ape, and bearEver was Báli special care;With his vast strength and mighty armHe kept them from all scathe and harm.And so the earth with hill, wood, seas,Was filled with mighty ones like these,Of various shape and race and kind,With proper homes to each assigned,With Ráma champions fierce and strongThe earth was overspread,High as the hills and clouds, a throngWith bodies vast and dread.(124)Canto XVII. Rishyasring Return.Now when the high-souled monarch rite,The Asvamedh, was finished quite,Their sacrificial dues obtained,The Gods their heavenly homes regained.The lofty-minded saints withdrew,Each to his place, with honour due,And kings and chieftains, one and all,Who came to grace the festival.And Dasaratha, ere they went,Addressed them thus benevolent:\"Now may you, each with joyful heart,To your own realms, O Kings, depart.Peace and good luck attend you there,And blessing, is my friendly prayer;Let cares of state each mind engageTo guard his royal heritage.A monarch from his throne expelledNo better than the dead is held.So he who cares for power and mightMust guard his realm and royal right.Such care a meed in heaven will bringBetter than rites and offering.Such care a king his country owesAs man upon himself bestows,When for his body he providesRaiment and every need besides.For future days should kings foresee,And keep the present error-free.\"Thus did the king the kings exhort:They heard, and turned them from the courtAnd, each to each in friendship bound,Went forth to all the realms around.The rites were o\\'er, the guests were sped:The train the best of Bráhmans led,In which the king with joyful soul,With his dear wives, and with the wholeOf his imperial host and trainOf cars and servants turned again,And, as a monarch dear to fame,Within his royal city came.Next, Rishyasring, well-honoured sage,And Sántá, sought their hermitage.The king himself, of prudent mind,Attended him, with troops behind.And all her men the town outpouredWith Saint Vasishtha and their lord.High mounted on a car of state,O\\'er canopied fair Sántá sate.Drawn by white oxen, while a bandOf servants marched on either hand.Great gifts of countless price she bore,With sheep and goats and gems in store.Like Beauty self the lady shoneWith all the jewels she had on,As, happy in her sweet content,Peerless amid the fair she went.Not Queen Paulomí(125) self could beMore loving to her lord than she.She who had lived in happy ease,Honoured with all her heart could please,While dames and kinsfolk ever viedTo see her wishes gratified,Soon as she knew her husband willAgain to seek the forest, stillWas ready for the hermit cot,Nor murmured at her altered lot.The king attended to the wildThat hermit and his own dear child,And in the centre of a throngOf noble courtiers rode along.The sage son had let prepareA lodge within the wood, and thereWhile they lingered blithe and gay.Then, duly honoured, went their way.The glorious hermit RishyasringDrew near and thus besought the king:\"Return, my honoured lord, I pray,Return, upon thy homeward way.\"The monarch, with the waiting crowd,Lifted his voice and wept aloud,And with eyes dripping still to eachOf his good queens he spake this speech:\"Kausalyá and Sumitrá dear,And thou, my sweet Kaikeyí, hear.All upon Sántá feast your gaze,The last time for a length of days.\"To Sántá arms the ladies leapt,And hung about her neck and wept,And cried, \"O, happy be the lifeOf this great Bráhman and his wife.The Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high,The Earth, the Streams, the circling Sky,Preserve thee in the wood, true spouse,Devoted to thy husband vows.And O dear Sántá, ne\\'er neglectTo pay the dues of meek respectTo the great saint, thy husband sire,With all observance and with fire.And, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,Forget not thou thy husband claim;In every change, in good and ill,Let thy sweet words delight him still,And let thy worship constant be:Her lord is woman deity.To learn thy welfare, dearest friend,The king will many a Bráhman send.Let happy thoughts thy spirit cheer,And be not troubled, daughter dear.\"These soothing words the ladies said.And pressed their lips upon her head.Each gave with sighs her last adieu,Then at the king command withdrew.The king around the hermit wentWith circling footsteps reverent,And placed at Rishyasring commandSome soldiers of his royal band.The Bráhman bowed in turn and cried,\"May fortune never leave thy side.O mighty King, with justice reign,And still thy people love retain.\"He spoke, and turned away his face,And, as the hermit went,The monarch, rooted to the place,Pursued with eyes intent.But when the sage had past from viewKing Dasaratha turned him too,Still fixing on his friend each thought.With such deep love his breast was fraught.Amid his people loud acclaimHome to his royal seat he came,And lived delighted there,Expecting when each queenly dame,Upholder of his ancient fame,Her promised son should bear.The glorious sage his way pursuedTill close before his eyes he viewedSweet Champá, Lomapád fair town,Wreathed with her Champacs\\'(126) leafy crown.Soon as the saint approach he knew,The king, to yield him honour due,Went forth to meet him with a bandOf priests and nobles of the land:\"Hail, Sage,\" he cried, \"O joy to me!What bliss it is, my lord, to seeThee with thy wife and all thy trainReturning to my town again.Thy father, honoured Sage, is well,Who hither from his woodland cellHas sent full many a messengerFor tidings both of thee and her.\"Then joyfully, for due respect,The monarch bade the town be decked.The king and Rishyasring elateEntered the royal city gate:In front the chaplain rode.Then, loved and honoured with all careBy monarch and by courtier, thereThe glorious saint abode.Canto XVIII. Rishyasring Departure.The monarch called a Bráhman nearAnd said, \"Now speed awayTo Kasyap son,(127) the mighty seer,And with all reverence sayThe holy child he holds so dear,The hermit of the noble mind,Whose equal it were hard to find,Returned, is dwelling here.Go, and instead of me do thouBefore that best of hermits bow,That still he may, for his dear son,Show me the favour I have won.\"Soon as the king these words had said,To Kasyap son the Bráhman sped.Before the hermit low he bentAnd did obeisance, reverent;Then with meek words his grace to craveThe message of his lord he gave:\"The high-souled father of his brideHad called thy son his rites to guide:Those rites are o\\'er, the steed is slain;Thy noble child is come again.\"Soon as the saint that speech had heardHis spirit with desire was stirredTo seek the city of the kingAnd to his cot his son to bring.With young disciples at his sideForth on his way the hermit hied,While peasants from their hamlets ranTo reverence the holy man.Each with his little gift of food,Forth came the village multitude,And, as they humbly bowed the head,\"What may we do for thee?\" they said.Then he, of Bráhmans first and best,The gathered people thus addressed:\"Now tell me for I fain would know,Why is it I am honoured so?\"They to the high-souled saint replied:\"Our ruler is with thee allied.Our master order we fulfil;O Bráhman, let thy mind be still.\"With joy the saintly hermit heardEach pleasant and delightful word,And poured a benediction downOn king and ministers and town.Glad at the words of that high saintSome servants hastened to acquaintTheir king, rejoicing to impartThe tidings that would cheer his heart.Soon as the joyful tale he knewTo meet the saint the monarch flew,The guest-gift in his hand he brought,And bowed before him and besought:\"This day by seeing thee I gainNot to have lived my life in vain,Now be not wroth with me, I pray,\"Because I wiled thy son away.(128)The best of Bráhmans answer made:\"Be not, great lord of kings, afraid.Thy virtues have not failed to winMy favour, O thou pure of sin.\"Then in the front the saint was placed,The king came next in joyous haste,And with him entered his abode,Mid glad acclaim as on they rode.To greet the sage the reverent crowdRaised suppliant hands and humbly bowed.Then from the palace many a dameFollowing well-dressed Sántá came,Stood by the mighty saint and cried:\"See, honour source, thy son dear bride.\"The saint, who every virtue knew,His arms around his daughter threw,And with a father rapture pressedThe lady to his wondering breast.Arising from the saint embraceShe bowed her low before his face,And then, with palm to palm applied,Stood by her hermit father side.He for his son, as laws ordain,Performed the rite that frees from stain,(129)And, honoured by the wise and good,With him departed to the wood.Canto XIX. The Birth Of The Princes.The seasons six in rapid flightHad circled since that glorious rite.Eleven months had passed away;\\'Twas Chaitra ninth returning day.(130)The moon within that mansion shoneWhich Aditi looks kindly on.Raised to their apex in the skyFive brilliant planets beamed on high.Shone with the moon, in Cancer sign,Vrihaspati(131) with light divine.Kausalyá bore an infant blestWith heavenly marks of grace impressed;Ráma, the universe lord,A prince by all the worlds adored.New glory Queen Kausalyá wonReflected from her splendid son.So Aditi shone more and more,The Mother of the Gods, when sheThe King of the Immortals(132) bore,The thunder-wielding deity.The lotus-eyed, the beauteous boy,He came fierce Rávan to destroy;From half of Vishnu vigour born,He came to help the worlds forlorn.And Queen Kaikeyí bore a childOf truest valour, Bharat styled,With every princely virtue blest,One fourth of Vishnu manifest.Sumitrá too a noble pair,Called Lakshman and Satrughna, bare,Of high emprise, devoted, true,Sharers in Vishnu essence too.\\'Neath Pushya(133) mansion, Mina(134) sign,Was Bharat born, of soul benign.The sun had reached the Crab at mornWhen Queen Sumitrá babes were born,What time the moon had gone to makeHis nightly dwelling with the Snake.The high-souled monarch consorts boreAt different times those glorious four,Like to himself and virtuous, brightAs Proshthapadá(135) four-fold light.Then danced the nymphs\\' celestial throng,The minstrels raised their strain;The drums of heaven pealed loud and long,And flowers came down in rain.Within Ayodhyá, blithe and gay,All kept the joyous holiday.The spacious square, the ample roadWith mimes and dancers overflowed,And with the voice of music rangWhere minstrels played and singers sang,And shone, a wonder to behold,With dazzling show of gems and gold.Nor did the king his largess spare,For minstrel, driver, bard, to share;Much wealth the Bráhmans bore away,And many thousand dine that day.Soon as each babe was twelve days old\\'Twas time the naming rite to hold.When Saint Vasishtha, rapt with joy,Assigned a name to every boy.Ráma, to him the high-souled heir,Bharat, to him Kaikeyí bare:Of Queen Sumitrá one fair sonWas Lakshman, and Satrughna(136) oneRáma, his sire supreme delight,Like some proud banner cheered his sight,And to all creatures seemed to beThe self-existent deity.All heroes, versed in holy lore,To all mankind great love they bore.Fair stores of wisdom all possessed,With princely graces all were blest.But mid those youths of high descent,With lordly light preëminent.Like the full moon unclouded, shoneRáma, the world dear paragon.He best the elephant could guide.(137)Urge the fleet car, the charger ride:A master he of bowman skill,Joying to do his father will.The world delight and darling, heLoved Lakshman best from infancyAnd Lakshman, lord of lofty fate,Upon his elder joyed to wait,Striving his second self to pleaseWith friendship sweet observances.His limbs the hero ne\\'er would restUnless the couch his brother pressed;Except beloved Ráma sharedHe could not taste the meal prepared.When Ráma, pride of Reghu race,Sprang on his steed to urge the chase,Behind him Lakshman loved to goAnd guard him with his trusty bow.As Ráma was to Lakshman dearMore than his life and ever near,So fond Satrughna prized aboveHis very life his Bharat love.Illustrious heroes, nobly kindIn mutual love they all combined,And gave their royal sire delightWith modest grace and warrior might:Supported by the glorious fourShone Dasaratha more and more,As though, with every guardian GodWho keeps the land and skies,The Father of all creatures trodThe earth before men eyes.Canto XX. Visvámitra Visit.Now Dasaratha pious mindMeet wedlock for his sons designed;With priests and friends the king beganTo counsel and prepare his plan.Such thoughts engaged his bosom, when,To see Ayodhyá lord of men,A mighty saint of glorious fame,The hermit Visvámitra(138) came.For evil fiends that roam by nightDisturbed him in each holy rite,And in their strength and frantic rageAssailed with witcheries the sage.He came to seek the monarch aidTo guard the rites the demons stayed,Unable to a close to bringOne unpolluted offering.Seeking the king in this dire straitHe said to those who kept the gate:\"Haste, warders, to your master run,And say that here stands Gádhi son.\"Soon as they heard the holy man,To the king chamber swift they ranWith minds disordered all, and spurredTo wildest zeal by what they heard.On to the royal hall they sped,There stood and lowly bowed the head,And made the lord of men awareThat the great saint was waiting there.The king with priest and peer aroseAnd ran the sage to meet,As Indra from his palace goesLord Brahmá self to greet.When glowing with celestial lightThe pious hermit was in sight,The king, whose mien his transport showed,The honoured gift for guests bestowed.Nor did the saint that gift despise,Offered as holy texts advise;He kindly asked the earth great kingHow all with him was prospering.The son of Kusik(139) bade him tellIf all in town and field were well,All well with friends, and kith and kin,And royal treasure stored within:\"Do all thy neighbours own thy sway?Thy foes confess thee yet?Dost thou continue still to payTo Gods and men each debt?\"Then he, of hermits first and best,Vasishtha with a smile(140) addressed,And asked him of his welfare too,Showing him honour as was due.Then with the sainted hermit allWent joyous to the monarch hall,And sate them down by due degree,Each one, of rank and dignity.Joy filled the noble prince breastWho thus bespoke the honoured guest:\"As amrit(141) by a mortal found,As rain upon the thirsty ground,As to an heirless man a sonBorn to him of his precious one,As gain of what we sorely miss,As sudden dawn of mighty bliss,So is thy coming here to me:All welcome, mighty Saint, to thee.What wish within thy heart hast thou?If I can please thee, tell me how.Hail, Saint, from whom all honours flow,Worthy of all I can bestow.Blest is my birth with fruit to-day,Nor has my life been thrown away.I see the best of Bráhman raceAnd night to glorious morn gives place.Thou, holy Sage, in days of oldAmong the royal saints enrolled,Didst, penance-glorified, withinThe Bráhman caste high station win.\\'Tis meet and right in many a wayThat I to thee should honour pay.This seems a marvel to mine eyes:All sin thy visit purifies;And I by seeing thee, O Sage,Have reaped the fruit of pilgrimage.Then say what thou wouldst have me do,That thou hast sought this interview.Favoured by thee, my wish is still,O Hermit, to perform thy will.Nor needest thou at length explainThe object that thy heart would gain.Without reserve I grant it now:My deity, O Lord, art thou.\"The glorious hermit, far renowned,With highest fame and virtue crowned,Rejoiced these modest words to hearDelightful to the mind and ear.Canto XXI. Visvámitra Speech.The hermit heard with high contentThat speech so wondrous eloquent,And while each hair with joy arose,(142)He thus made answer at the close:\"Good is thy speech O noble King,And like thyself in everything.So should their lips be wisdom-fraughtWhom kings begot, Vasishtha taught.The favour which I came to seekThou grantest ere my tongue can speak.But let my tale attention claim,And hear the need for which I came.O King, as Scripture texts allow,A holy rite employs me now.Two fiends who change their forms at willImpede that rite with cursed skill.(143)Oft when the task is nigh complete,These worst of fiends my toil defeat,Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o\\'erThe altar shed a stream of gore.When thus the rite is mocked and stayed,And all my pious hopes delayed,Cast down in heart the spot I leave,And spent with fruitless labour grieve.Nor can I, checked by prudence, dareLet loose my fury on them there:The muttered curse, the threatening word,In such a rite must ne\\'er be heard.Thy grace the rite from check can free.And yield the fruit I long to see.Thy duty bids thee, King, defendThe suffering guest, the suppliant friend.Give me thy son, thine eldest born,Whom locks like raven wings adorn.That hero youth, the truly brave,Of thee, O glorious King, I crave.For he can lay those demons lowWho mar my rites and work me woe:My power shall shield the youth from harm,And heavenly might shall nerve his arm.And on my champion will I showerUnnumbered gifts of varied power,Such gifts as shall ensure his fameAnd spread through all the worlds his name.Be sure those fiends can never standBefore the might of Ráma hand,And mid the best and bravest noneCan slay that pair but Raghu son.Entangled in the toils of FateThose sinners, proud and obstinate,Are, in their fury overbold,No match for Ráma mighty-souled.Nor let a father breast give wayToo far to fond affection sway.Count thou the fiends already slain:My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain.I know the hero Ráma wellIn whom high thoughts and valour dwell;So does Vasishtha, so do theseEngaged in long austerities.If thou would do the righteous deed,And win high fame, thy virtue meed,Fame that on earth shall last and live,To me, great King, thy Ráma give.If to the words that I have said,With Saint Vasishtha at their headThy holy men, O King, agree,Then let thy Ráma go with me.Ten nights my sacrifice will last,And ere the stated time be pastThose wicked fiends, those impious twain,Must fall by wondrous Ráma slain.Let not the hours, I warn thee, fly,Fixt for the rite, unheeded by;Good luck have thou, O royal Chief,Nor give thy heart to needless grief.\"Thus in fair words with virtue fraughtThe pious glorious saint besought.But the good speech with poignant stingPierced ear and bosom of the king,Who, stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear,Fell prostrate and lay fainting there.Canto XXII. Dasaratha Speech.His tortured senses all astray,While the hapless monarch lay,Then slowly gathering thought and strengthTo Visvámitra spoke at length:\"My son is but a child, I ween;This year he will be just sixteen.How is he fit for such emprise,My darling with the lotus eyes?A mighty army will I bringThat calls me master, lord, and king,And with its countless squadrons fightAgainst these rovers of the night.My faithful heroes skilled to wieldThe arms of war will take the field;Their skill the demons\\' might may break:Ráma, my child, thou must not take.I, even I, my bow in hand,Will in the van of battle stand,And, while my soul is left alive,With the night-roaming demons strive.Thy guarded sacrifice shall beCompleted, from all hindrance free.Thither will I my journey make:Ráma, my child, thou must not take.A boy unskilled, he knows not yetThe bounds to strength and weakness set.No match is he for demon foesWho magic arts to arms oppose.O chief of saints, I have no power,Of Ráma reft, to live one hour:Mine aged heart at once would break:Ráma, my child, thou must not take.Nine thousand circling years have fledWith all their seasons o\\'er my head,And as a hard-won boon, O sage,These sons have come to cheer mine age.My dearest love amid the fourIs he whom first his mother bore,Still dearer for his virtues\\' sake:Ráma, my child, thou must not take.But if, unmoved by all I say,Thou needs must bear my son away,Let me lead with him, I entreat,A four-fold army(144) all complete.What is the demons\\' might, O Sage?Who are they? What their parentage?What is their size? What beings lendTheir power to guard them and befriend?How can my son their arts withstand?Or I or all my armed band?Tell me the whole that I may knowTo meet in war each evil foeWhom conscious might inspires with pride.\"And Visvámitra thus replied:\"Sprung from Pulastya race there cameA giant known by Rávan name.Once favoured by the Eternal SireHe plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,For peerless power and might renowned,By giant bands encompassed round.Visravas for his sire they hold,His brother is the Lord of Gold.King of the giant hosts is he,And worst of all in cruelty.This Rávan dread commands impelTwo demons who in might excel,Márícha and Suváhu hight,To trouble and impede the rite.\"Then thus the king addressed the sage:\"No power have I, my lord, to wageWar with this evil-minded foe;Now pity on my darling show,And upon me of hapless fate,For thee as God I venerate.Gods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth,(145)The birds of air, the snakes of earthBefore the might of Rávan quail,Much less can mortal man avail.He draws, I hear, from out the breastThe valour of the mightiest.No, ne\\'er can I with him contend,Or with the forces he may send.How can I then my darling lend,Godlike, unskilled in battle? No,I will not let my young child go.Foes of thy rite, those mighty ones,Sunda and Upasunda sons,Are fierce as Fate to overthrow:I will not let my young child go.Márícha and Suváhu fellAre valiant and instructed well.One of the twain I might attack.With all my friends their lord to back.\"Canto XXIII. Vasishtha Speech.While thus the hapless monarch spoke,Paternal love his utterance broke.Then words like these the saint returned,And fury in his bosom burned:\"Didst thou, O King, a promise make,And wishest now thy word to break?A son of Raghu line should scornTo fail in faith, a man forsworn.But if thy soul can bear the shameI will return e\\'en as I came.Live with thy sons, and joy be thine,False scion of Kakutstha line.\"As Visvámitra, mighty sage,Was moved with this tempestuous rage,Earth rocked and reeled throughout her frame,And fear upon the Immortals came.But Saint Vasishtha, wisest seer,Observant of his vows austere,Saw the whole world convulsed with dread,And thus unto the monarch said:\"Thou, born of old Ikshváku seed,Art Justice\\' self in mortal weed.Constant and pious, blest by fate,The right thou must not violate.Thou, Raghu son, so famous throughThe triple world as just and true,Perform thy bounden duty still,Nor stain thy race by deed of ill.If thou have sworn and now refuseThou must thy store of merit lose.Then, Monarch, let thy Ráma go,Nor fear for him the demon foe.The fiends shall have no power to hurtHim trained to war or inexpert,Nor vanquish him in battle field,For Kusik son the youth will shield.He is incarnate Justice, heThe best of men for bravery.Embodied love of penance drear,Among the wise without a peer.Full well he knows, great Kusik son,The arms celestial, every one,Arms from the Gods themselves concealed,Far less to other men revealed.These arms to him, when earth he swayed,Mighty Krisásva, pleased, conveyed.Krisásva sons they are indeed,Brought forth by Daksha lovely seed,(146)Heralds of conquest, strong and bold,Brilliant, of semblance manifold.Jayá and Vijayá, most fair,And hundred splendid weapons bare.Of Jayá, glorious as the morn,First fifty noble sons were born,Boundless in size yet viewless too,They came the demons to subdue.And fifty children also cameOf Vijayá the beauteous dame,Sanháras named, of mighty force,Hard to assail or check in course.Of these the hermit knows the use,And weapons new can he produce.All these the mighty saint will yieldTo Ráma hand, to own and wield;And armed with these, beyond a doubtShall Ráma put those fiends to rout.For Ráma and the people sake,For thine own good my counsel take,Nor seek, O King, with fond delay,The parting of thy son to stay.\"Canto XXIV. The Spells.Vasishtha thus was speaking still:The monarch, of his own free will,Bade with quick zeal and joyful cheerRáma and Lakshman hasten near.Mother and sire in loving careSped their dear son with rite and prayer:Vasishtha blessed him ere he went;O\\'er his loved head the father bent,And then to Kusik son resignedRáma with Lakshman close behind.Standing by Visvámitra side,The youthful hero, lotus-eyed,The Wind-God saw, and sent a breezeWhose sweet pure touch just waved the trees.There fell from heaven a flowery rain,And with the song and dance the strainOf shell and tambour sweetly blentAs forth the son of Raghu went.The hermit led: behind him cameThe bow-armed Ráma, dear to fame,Whose locks were like the raven wing:(147)Then Lakshman, closely following.The Gods and Indra, filled with joy,Looked down upon the royal boy,And much they longed the death to seeOf their ten-headed enemy.(148)Ráma and Lakshman paced behindThat hermit of the lofty mind,As the young Asvins,(149) heavenly pair,Follow Lord Indra through the air.On arm and hand the guard they wore,Quiver and bow and sword they bore;Two fire-born Gods of War seemed they.(150)He, Siva self who led the way.Upon fair Sarjú southern shoreThey now had walked a league and more,When thus the sage in accents mildTo Ráma said: \"Beloved child,This lustral water duly touch:My counsel will avail thee much.Forget not all the words I say,Nor let the occasion slip away.Lo, with two spells I thee invest,The mighty and the mightiest.O\\'er thee fatigue shall ne\\'er prevail,Nor age or change thy limbs assail.Thee powers of darkness ne\\'er shall smiteIn tranquil sleep or wild delight.No one is there in all the landThine equal for the vigorous hand.Thou, when thy lips pronounce the spell,Shalt have no peer in heaven or hell.None in the world with thee shall vie,O sinless one, in apt reply,In fortune, knowledge, wit, and tact,Wisdom to plan and skill to act.This double science take, and gainGlory that shall for aye remain.Wisdom and judgment spring from eachOf these fair spells whose use I teach.Hunger and thirst unknown to thee,High in the worlds thy rank shall be.For these two spells with might endued,Are the Great Father heavenly brood,And thee, O Chief, may fitly grace,Thou glory of Kakutstha race.Virtues which none can match are thine,Lord, from thy birth, of gifts divine,And now these spells of might shall castFresh radiance o\\'er the gifts thou hast.\"Then Ráma duly touched the wave,Raised suppliant hands, bowed low his head,And took the spells the hermit gave,Whose soul on contemplation fed.From him whose might these gifts enhanced,A brighter beam of glory glanced:So shines in all his autumn blazeThe Day-God of the thousand rays.The hermit wants those youths supplied,As pupils use to holy guide.And then the night in sweet contentOn Sarjú pleasant bank they spent.Canto XXV. The Hermitage Of Love.Soon as appeared the morning lightUp rose the mighty anchorite,And thus to youthful Ráma said,Who lay upon his leafy bed:\"High fate is hers who calls thee son:Arise, \\'tis break of day;Rise, Chief, and let those rites be doneDue at the morning ray.\"(151)At that great sage high behestUp sprang the princely pair,To bathing rites themselves addressed,And breathed the holiest prayer.Their morning task completed, theyTo Visvámitra cameThat store of holy works, to payThe worship saints may claim.Then to the hallowed spot they wentAlong fair Sarjú sideWhere mix her waters confluentWith three-pathed Gangá tide.(152)There was a sacred hermitageWhere saints devout of mindTheir lives through many a lengthened ageTo penance had resigned.That pure abode the princes eyedWith unrestrained delight,And thus unto the saint they cried,Rejoicing at the sight:\"Whose is that hermitage we see?Who makes his dwelling there?Full of desire to hear are we:O Saint, the truth declare.\"The hermit smiling made replyTo the two boys\\' request:\"Hear, Ráma, who in days gone byThis calm retreat possessed.Kandarpa in apparent form,Called Káma(153) by the wise,Dared Umá(154) new-wed lord to stormAnd make the God his prize.\\'Gainst Sthánu(155) self, on rites austereAnd vows intent,(156) they say,His bold rash hand he dared to rear,Though Sthánu cried, Away!But the God eye with scornful glareFell terrible on him.Dissolved the shape that was so fairAnd burnt up every limb.Since the great God terrific rageDestroyed his form and frame,Káma in each succeeding ageHas borne Ananga(157) name.So, where his lovely form decayed,This land is Anga styled:Sacred to him of old this shade,And hermits undefiled.Here Scripture-talking elders swayEach sense with firm control,And penance-rites have washed awayAll sin from every soul.One night, fair boy, we here will spend,A pure stream on each hand,And with to-morrow light will bendOur steps to yonder strand.Here let us bathe, and free from stainTo that pure grove repair,Sacred to Káma, and remainOne night in comfort there.\"With penance\\' far-discerning eyeThe saintly men beheldTheir coming, and with transport highEach holy bosom swelled.To Kusik son the gift they gaveThat honoured guest should greet,Water they brought his feet to lave,And showed him honor meet.Ráma and Lakshman next obtainedIn due degree their share.Then with sweet talk the guests remained,And charmed each listener there.The evening prayers were duly saidWith voices calm and low:Then on the ground each laid his headAnd slept till morning glow.Canto XXVI. The Forest Of Tádaká.When the fair light of morning roseThe princely tamers of their foesFollowed, his morning worship o\\'er,The hermit to the river shore.The high-souled men with thoughtful careA pretty barge had stationed there.All cried, \"O lord, this barge ascend,And with thy princely followers bendTo yonder side thy prosperous wayWith naught to check thee or delay.\"Nor did the saint their rede reject:He bade farewell with due respect,And crossed, attended by the twain,That river rushing to the main.When now the bark was half way o\\'er,Ráma and Lakshman heard the roar,That louder grew and louder yet,Of waves by dashing waters met.Then Ráma asked the mighty seer:\"What is the tumult that I hearOf waters cleft in mid career?\"Soon as the speech of Ráma, stirredBy deep desire to know, he heard,The pious saint began to tellWhat paused the waters\\' roar and swell:\"On high Kailása distant hillThere lies a noble lakeWhose waters, born from Brahmá will,The name of Mánas(158) take.Thence, hallowing where\\'er they flow,The streams of Sarjú fall,And wandering through the plains belowEmbrace Ayodhyá wall.Still, still preserved in Sarjú nameSarovar(159) fame we trace.The flood of Brahma whence she cameTo run her holy race.To meet great Gangá here she hiesWith tributary wave:Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,Of floods that swell and rave.Here, pride of Raghu line, do thouIn humble adoration bow.\"He spoke. The princes both obeyed,And reverence to each river paid.(160)They reached the southern shore at last,And gaily on their journey passed.A little space beyond there stoodA gloomy awe-inspiring wood.The monarch noble son beganTo question thus the holy man:\"Whose gloomy forest meets mine eyeLike some vast cloud that fills the sky?Pathless and dark it seems to be,Where birds in thousands wander free;Where shrill cicadas\\' cries resound,And fowl of dismal note abound.Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,There shrubs and thorns run wild:Dháo, Sál, Bignonia, Bel,(161) are found,And every tree that grows on ground.How is the forest styled?\"The glorious saint this answer made:\"Dear child of Raghu, hearWho dwells within the horrid shadeThat looks so dark and drear.Where now is wood, long ere this dayTwo broad and fertile lands,Malaja and Karúsha lay,Adorned by heavenly hands.Here, mourning friendship broken ties,Lord Indra of the thousand eyesHungered and sorrowed many a day,His brightness soiled with mud and clay,When in a storm of passion heHad slain his dear friend Namuchi.Then came the Gods and saints who boreTheir golden pitchers brimming o\\'erWith holy streams that banish stain,And bathed Lord Indra pure again.When in this land the God was freedFrom spot and stain of impious deedFor that his own dear friend he slew,High transport thrilled his bosom through.Then in his joy the lands he blessed,And gave a boon they long possessed:\"Because these fertile lands retainThe washings of the blot and stain,\"\\'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,\"Malaja and Karúsha nameShall celebrate with deathless fameMy malady and care.\"(162)\"So be it,\" all the Immortals cried,When Indra speech they heard,And with acclaim they ratifiedThe names his lips conferred.Long time, O victor of thy foes,These happy lands had sweet repose,And higher still in fortune rose.At length a spirit, loving ill,Tádaká, wearing shapes at will,Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast,A thousand elephants, surpassed,Was to fierce Sunda, lord and headOf all the demon armies, wed.From her, Lord Indra peer in mightGiant Márícha sprang to light:And she, a constant plague and pest,These two fair realms has long distressed.Now dwelling in her dark abodeA league away she bars the road:And we, O Ráma, hence must goWhere lies the forest of the foe.Now on thine own right arm rely,And my command obey:Smite the foul monster that she die,And take the plague away.To reach this country none may dareFallen from its old estate,Which she, whose fury naught can bear,Has left so desolate.And now my truthful tale is toldHow with accursed swayThe spirit plagued this wood of old,And ceases not to-day.\"Canto XXVII. The Birth Of Tádaká.When thus the sage without a peerHad closed that story strange to hear,Ráma again the saint addressedTo set one lingering doubt at rest:\"O holy man, \\'tis said by allThat spirits\\' strength is weak and small:How can she match, of power so slight,A thousand elephants in might?\"And Visvámitra thus repliedTo Raghu son the glorified:\"Listen, and I will tell thee howShe gained the strength that arms her now.A mighty spirit lived of yore;Suketu was the name he bore.Childless was he, and free from crimeIn rites austere he passed his time.The mighty Sire was pleased to showHis favour, and a child bestow.Tádaká named, most fair to see,A pearl among the maids was she,And matched, for such was Brahmá dower,A thousand elephants in power.Nor would the Eternal Sire, althoughThe spirit longed, a son bestowThat maid in beauty youthful prideWas given to Sunda for a bride.Her son, Márícha was his name,A giant, through a curse, became.She, widowed, dared with him molestAgastya,(163) of all saints the best.Inflamed with hunger wildest rage,Roaring she rushed upon the sage.When the great hermit saw her near,On speeding in her fierce career,He thus pronounced Márícha doom:\"A giant form and shape assume.\"And then, by mighty anger swayed,On Tádaká this curse he laid:\"Thy present form and semblance quit,And wear a shape thy mood to fit;Changed form and feature by my ban,A fearful thing that feeds on man.\"She, by his awful curse possessed,And mad with rage that fills her breast,Has on this land her fury dealtWhere once the saint Agastya dwelt.Go, Ráma, smite this monster dead,The wicked plague, of power so dread,And further by this deed of thineThe good of Bráhmans and of kine.Thy hand alone can overthrow,In all the worlds, this impious foe.Nor let compassion lead thy mindTo shrink from blood of womankind;A monarch son must ever countThe people welfare paramount,And whether pain or joy he dealDare all things for his subjects\\' weal;Yea, if the deed bring praise or guilt,If life be saved or blood be spilt:Such, through all time, should be the careOf those a kingdom weight who bear.Slay, Ráma, slay this impious fiend,For by no law her life is screened.So Manthará, as bards have told,Virochan child, was slain of oldBy Indra, when in furious hateShe longed the earth to devastate.So Kávya mother, Bhrigu wife,Who loved her husband as her life,When Indra throne she sought to gain,By Vishnu hand of yore was slain.By these and high-souled kings beside,Struck down, have lawless women died.\"Canto XXVIII. The Death Of Tádaká.Thus spoke the saint. Each vigorous wordThe noble monarch offspring heard,And, reverent hands together laid,His answer to the hermit made:\"My sire and mother bade me ayeThy word, O mighty Saint, obeySo will I, O most glorious, killThis Tádaká who joys in ill,For such my sire, and such thy will.To aid with mine avenging handThe Bráhmans, kine, and all the land,Obedient, heart and soul, I stand.\"Thus spoke the tamer of the foe,And by the middle grasped his bow.Strongly he drew the sounding stringThat made the distant welkin ring.Scared by the mighty clang the deerThat roamed the forest shook with fear,And Tádaká the echo heard,And rose in haste from slumber stirred.In wild amaze, her soul aflameWith fury toward the spot she came.When that foul shape of evil mienAnd stature vast as e\\'er was seenThe wrathful son of Raghu eyed,He thus unto his brother cried:\"Her dreadful shape, O Lakshman, see,A form to shudder at and flee.The hideous monster very viewWould cleave a timid heart in two.Behold the demon hard to smite,Defended by her magic might.My hand shall stay her course to-day,And shear her nose and ears away.No heart have I her life to take:I spare it for her sex sake.My will is but, with minished force,To check her in her evil course.\"While thus he spoke, by rage impelledRoaring as she came nigh,The fiend her course at Ráma heldWith huge arms tossed on high.Her, rushing on, the seer assailedWith a loud cry of hate;And thus the sons of Raghu hailed:\"Fight, and be fortunate.\"Then from the earth a horrid cloudOf dust the demon raised,And for awhile in darkling shroudWrapt Raghu sons amazed.Then calling on her magic powerThe fearful fight to wage,She smote him with a stony shower,Till Ráma burned with rage.Then pouring forth his arrowy rainThat stony flood to stay,With winged darts, as she charged amain,He shore her hands away.As Tádaká still thundered nearThus maimed by Ráma blows,Lakshman in fury severed sheerThe monster ears and nose.Assuming by her magic skillA fresh and fresh disguise,She tried a thousand shapes at will,Then vanished from their eyes.When Gádhi son of high renownStill saw the stony rain pour downUpon each princely warrior head,With words of wisdom thus he said:\"Enough of mercy, Ráma, lestThis sinful evil-working pest,Disturber of each holy rite,Repair by magic arts her might.Without delay the fiend should die,For, see, the twilight hour is nigh.And at the joints of night and daySuch giant foes are hard to slay.\"Then Ráma, skilful to directHis arrow to the sound,With shafts the mighty demon checkedWho rained her stones around.She sore impeded and besetBy Ráma and his arrowy net,Though skilled in guile and magic lore,Rushed on the brothers with a roar.Deformed, terrific, murderous, dread,Swift as the levin on she sped,Like cloudy pile in autumn sky,Lifting her two vast arms on high,When Ráma smote her with a dart,Shaped like a crescent, to the heart.Sore wounded by the shaft that cameWith lightning speed and surest aim,Blood spouting from her mouth and side,She fell upon the earth and died.Soon as the Lord who rules the skySaw the dread monster lifeless lie,He called aloud, Well done! well done!And the Gods honoured Raghu son.Standing in heaven the Thousand-eyed,With all the Immortals, joying cried:\"Lift up thine eyes, O Saint, and seeThe Gods and Indra nigh to thee.This deed of Ráma boundless mightHas filled our bosoms with delight,Now, for our will would have it so,To Raghu son some favour show.Invest him with the power which naughtBut penance gains and holy thought,Those heavenly arms on him bestowTo thee entrusted long agoBy great Krisásva best of kings,Son of the Lord of living things.More fit recipient none can beThan he who joys it following thee;And for our sakes the monarch seedHas yet to do a mighty deed.\"He spoke; and all the heavenly trainRejoicing sought their homes again,While honour to the saint they paid.Then came the evening twilight shade,The best of hermits overjoyedTo know the monstrous fiend destroyed,His lips on Ráma forehead pressed,And thus the conquering chief addressed:\"O Ráma gracious to the sight.Here will we pass the present night,And with the morrow earliest rayBend to my hermitage our way.\"The son of Dasaratha heard,Delighted, Visvámitra word,And as he bade, that night he spentIn Tádaká wild wood, content.And the grove shone that happy day,Freed from the curse that on it lay,Like Chaitraratha(164) fair and gay.Canto XXIX. The Celestial Arms.That night they slept and took their rest;And then the mighty saint addressed,With pleasant smile and accents mildThese words to Raghu princely child:\"Well pleased am I. High fate be thine,Thou scion of a royal line.Now will I, for I love thee so,All heavenly arms on thee bestow.Victor with these, whoe\\'er oppose,Thy hand shall conquer all thy foes,Though Gods and spirits of the air,Serpents and fiends, the conflict dare.I\\'ll give thee as a pledge of loveThe mystic arms they use above,For worthy thou to have revealedThe weapons I have learnt to wield.(165)First, son of Raghu, shall be thineThe arm of Vengeance, strong, divine:The arm of Fate, the arm of Right,And Vishnu arm of awful might:That, before which no foe can stand,The thunderbolt of Indra hand;And Siva trident, sharp and dread,And that dire weapon Brahmá Head.And two fair clubs, O royal child,One Charmer and one Pointed styledWith flame of lambent fire aglow,On thee, O Chieftain, I bestow.And Fate dread net and Justice\\' nooseThat none may conquer, for thy use:And the great cord, renowned of old,Which Varun ever loves to hold.Take these two thunderbolts, which IHave got for thee, the Moist and Dry.Here Siva dart to thee I yield,And that which Vishnu wont to wield.I give to thee the arm of Fire,Desired by all and named the Spire.To thee I grant the Wind-God dart,Named Crusher, O thou pure of heart,This arm, the Horse Head, accept,And this, the Curlew Bill yclept,And these two spears, the best e\\'er flew,Named the Invincible and True.And arms of fiends I make thine own,Skull-wreath and mace that smashes bone.And Joyous, which the spirits bear,Great weapon of the sons of air.Brave offspring of the best of lords,I give thee now the Gem of swords,And offer next, thine hand to arm,The heavenly bards\\' beloved charm.Now with two arms I thee investOf never-ending Sleep and Rest,With weapons of the Sun and Rain,And those that dry and burn amain;And strong Desire with conquering touch,The dart that Káma prizes much.I give the arm of shadowy powersThat bleeding flesh of men devours.I give the arms the God of GoldAnd giant fiends exult to hold.This smites the foe in battle-strife,And takes his fortune, strength, and life.I give the arms called False and True,And great Illusion give I too;The hero arm called Strong and BrightThat spoils the foeman strength in fight.I give thee as a priceless boonThe Dew, the weapon of the Moon,And add the weapon, deftly planned,That strengthens Visvakarmá hand.The Mortal dart whose point is chill,And Slaughter, ever sure to kill;All these and other arms, for thouArt very dear, I give thee now.Receive these weapons from my hand,Son of the noblest in the land.\"Facing the east, the glorious saintPure from all spot of earthly taint,To Ráma, with delighted mind,That noble host of spells consigned.He taught the arms, whose lore is wonHardly by Gods, to Raghu son.He muttered low the spell whose callSummons those arms and rules them allAnd, each in visible form and frame,Before the monarch son they came.They stood and spoke in reverent guiseTo Ráma with exulting cries:\"O noblest child of Raghu, see,Thy ministers and thralls are we.\"With joyful heart and eager handRáma received the wondrous band,And thus with words of welcome cried:\"Aye present to my will abide.\"Then hasted to the saint to payDue reverence, and pursued his way.Canto XXX. The Mysterious Powers.(166)Pure, with glad cheer and joyful breast,Of those mysterious arms possessed,Ráma, now passing on his way,Thus to the saint began to say:\"Lord of these mighty weapons, ICan scarce be harmed by Gods on high;Now, best of saints, I long to gainThe powers that can these arms restrain.\"Thus spoke the prince. The sage austere,True to his vows, from evil clear,Called forth the names of those great charmsWhose powers restrain the deadly arms.\"Receive thou True and Truly famed,And Bold and Fleet: the weapons namedWarder and Progress, swift of pace,Averted-head and Drooping-face;The Seen, and that which Secret flies;The weapon of the thousand eyes;Ten-headed, and the Hundred-faced,Star-gazer and the Layer-waste:The Omen-bird, the Pure-from-spot,The pair that wake and slumber not:The Fiendish, that which shakes amain,The Strong-of-Hand, the Rich-in-Gain:The Guardian, and the Close-allied,The Gaper, Love, and Golden-side:O Raghu son receive all these,Bright ones that wear what forms they please;Krisásva mystic sons are they,And worthy thou their might to sway.\"With joy the pride of Raghu raceReceived the hermit proffered grace,Mysterious arms, to check and stay,Or smite the foeman in the fray.Then, all with heavenly forms endued,Nigh came the wondrous multitude.Celestial in their bright attireSome shone like coals of burning fire;Some were like clouds of dusky smoke;And suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:\"Thy thralls, O Ráma, here we stand:Command, we pray, thy faithful band\"\"Depart,\" he cried, \"where each may list,But when I call you to assist,Be present to my mind with speed,And aid me in the hour of need.\"To Ráma then they lowly bent,And round him in due reverence went,To his command, they answered, Yea,And as they came so went away.When thus the arms had homeward flown,With pleasant words and modest tone,E\\'en as he walked, the prince beganTo question thus the holy man:\"What cloudlike wood is that which nearThe mountain side I see appear?O tell me, for I long to know;Its pleasant aspect charms me so.Its glades are full of deer at play,And sweet birds sing on every spray,Past is the hideous wild; I feelSo sweet a tremor o\\'er me steal,And hail with transport fresh and newA land that is so fair to view.Then tell me all, thou holy Sage,And whose this pleasant hermitageIn which those wicked ones delightTo mar and kill each holy rite.And with foul heart and evil deedThy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.To whom, O Sage, belongs this landIn which thine altars ready stand!\\'Tis mine to guard them, and to slayThe giants who the rites would stay.All this, O best of saints, I burnFrom thine own lips, my lord, to learn.\"Canto XXXI. The Perfect Hermitage.Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,And thus replied the anchorite:\"Chief of the mighty arm, of yoreLord Vishnu whom the Gods adore,For holy thought and rites austereOf penance made his dwelling here.This ancient wood was called of oldGrove of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,And when perfection he attainedThe grove the name of Perfect gained.Bali of yore, Virochan son,Dominion over Indra won,And when with power his proud heart swelled,O\\'er the three worlds his empire held.When Bali then began a rite,The Gods and Indra in affrightSought Vishnu in this place of rest,And thus with prayers the God addressed:\"Bali. Virochan mighty son,His sacrifice has now begun:Of boundless wealth, that demon kingIs bounteous to each living thing.Though suppliants flock from every sideThe suit of none is e\\'er denied.Whate\\'er, where\\'er howe\\'er the call,He hears the suit and gives to all.Now with thine own illusive artPerform, O Lord, the helper part:Assume a dwarfish form, and thusFrom fear and danger rescue us.\"(167)Thus in their dread the Immortals sued:The God a dwarflike shape indued:(168)Before Virochan son he came,Three steps of land his only claim.The boon obtained, in wondrous wiseLord Vishnu form increased in size;Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,God of the Triple Step, he passed.(169)The whole broad earth from side to sideHe measured with one mighty stride,Spanned with the next the firmament,And with the third through heaven he went.Thus was the king of demons hurledBy Vishnu to the nether world,And thus the universe restoredTo Indra rule, its ancient lord.And now because the immortal GodThis spot in dwarflike semblance trod,The grove has aye been loved by meFor reverence of the devotee.But demons haunt it, prompt to stayEach holy offering I would pay.Be thine, O lion-lord, to killThese giants that delight in ill.This day, beloved child, our feetShall rest within the calm retreat:And know, thou chief of Raghu line,My hermitage is also thine.\"He spoke; and soon the anchorite,With joyous looks that beamed delight,With Ráma and his brother stoodWithin the consecrated wood.Soon as they saw the holy man,With one accord together ranThe dwellers in the sacred shade,And to the saint their reverence paid,And offered water for his feet,The gift of honour and a seat;And next with hospitable careThey entertained the princely pair.The royal tamers of their foesRested awhile in sweet repose:Then to the chief of hermits suedStanding in suppliant attitude:\"Begin, O best of saints, we pray,Initiatory rites to-day.This Perfect Grove shall be anewMade perfect, and thy words be true.\"Then, thus addressed, the holy man,The very glorious sage, beganThe high preliminary rite.Restraining sense and appetite.Calmly the youths that night reposed,And rose when morn her light disclosed,Their morning worship paid, and tookOf lustral water from the brook.Thus purified they breathed the prayer,Then greeted Visvámitra whereAs celebrant he sate besideThe flame with sacred oil supplied.Canto XXXII. Visvámitra Sacrifice.That conquering pair, of royal race,Skilled to observe due time and place,To Kusik hermit son addressed,In timely words, their meet request:\"When must we, lord, we pray thee tell,Those Rovers of the Night repel?Speak, lest we let the moment fly,And pass the due occasion by.\"Thus longing for the strife, they prayed,And thus the hermits answer made:\"Till the fifth day be come and past,O Raghu sons, your watch must last.The saint his Dikshá(170) has begun,And all that time will speak to none.\"Soon as the steadfast devoteesHad made reply in words like these,The youths began, disdaining sleep,Six days and nights their watch to keep.The warrior pair who tamed the foe,Unrivalled benders of the bow,Kept watch and ward unwearied stillTo guard the saint from scathe and ill.\\'Twas now the sixth returning day,The hour foretold had past away.Then Ráma cried: \"O Lakshman, nowFirm, watchful, resolute be thou.The fiends as yet have kept afarFrom the pure grove in which we are:Yet waits us, ere the day shall close,Dire battle with the demon foes.\"While thus spoke Ráma borne awayBy longing for the deadly fray,See! bursting from the altar cameThe sudden glory of the flame.Round priest and deacon, and uponGrass, ladles, flowers, the splendour shone,And the high rite, in order due,With sacred texts began anew.But then a loud and fearful roarRe-echoed through the sky;And like vast clouds that shadow o\\'erThe heavens in dark July,Involved in gloom of magic mightTwo fiends rushed on amain,Márícha, Rover of the Night,Suváhu, and their train.As on they came in wild careerThick blood in rain they shed;And Ráma saw those things of fearImpending overhead.Then soon as those accursed twoWho showered down blood be spied,Thus to his brother brave and trueSpoke Ráma lotus-eyed:\"Now, Lakshman, thou these fiends shalt see,Man-eaters, foul of mind,Before my mortal weapon fleeLike clouds before the wind.\"He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,Upon his bow he pressed,And smote, to utmost fury wrought,Márícha on the breast.Deep in his flesh the weapon layWinged by the mystic spell,And, hurled a hundred leagues away,In ocean flood he fell.Then Ráma, when he saw the foeConvulsed and mad with painNeath the chill-pointed weapon blow,To Lakshman spoke again:\"See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dartThat strikes a numbing chill,Hath struck him senseless with the smart,But left him breathing still.But these who love the evil way,And drink the blood they spill,Rejoicing holy rites to stay,Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.\"He seized another shaft, the best,Aglow with living flame;It struck Suváhu on the chest,And dead to earth he came.Again a dart, the Wind-God own,Upon his string he laid,And all the demons were o\\'erthrown,The saints no more afraid.When thus the fiends were slain in fight,Disturbers of each holy rite,Due honour by the saints was paidTo Ráma for his wondrous aid:So Indra is adored when heHas won some glorious victory.Success at last the rite had crowned,And Visvámitra gazed around,And seeing every side at rest,The son of Raghu thus addressed:\"My joy, O Prince, is now complete:Thou hast obeyed my will:Perfect before, this calm retreatIs now more perfect still.\"Canto XXXIII. The Sone.Their task achieved, the princes spentThat night with joy and full content.Ere yet the dawn was well displayedTheir morning rites they duly paid,And sought, while yet the light was faint,The hermits and the mighty saint.They greeted first that holy sireResplendent like the burning fire,And then with noble words beganTheir sweet speech to the sainted man:\"Here stand, O Lord, thy servants true:Command what thou wouldst have us do.\"The saints, by Visvámitra led,To Ráma thus in answer said:\"Janak the king who rules the landOf fertile Míthilá has plannedA noble sacrifice, and weWill thither go the rite to see.Thou, Prince of men, with us shalt go,And there behold the wondrous bow,Terrific, vast, of matchless might,Which, splendid at the famous rite,The Gods assembled gave the king.No giant, fiend, or God can stringThat gem of bows, no heavenly bard:Then, sure, for man the task were hard.When lords of earth have longed to knowThe virtue of that wondrous bow,The strongest sons of kings in vainHave tried the mighty cord to strain.This famous bow thou there shalt view,And wondrous rites shalt witness too.The high-souled king who lords it o\\'erThe realm of Míthilá of yoreGained from the Gods this bow, the priceOf his imperial sacrifice.Won by the rite the glorious prizeStill in the royal palace lies,Laid up in oil of precious scentWith aloe-wood and incense blent.\"Then Ráma answering, Be it so,Made ready with the rest to go.The saint himself was now prepared,But ere beyond the grove he fared,He turned him and in words like theseAddressed the sylvan deities:\"Farewell! each holy rite complete,I leave the hermits\\' perfect seat:To Gangá northern shore I goBeneath Himálaya peaks of snow.\"With reverent steps he paced aroundThe limits of the holy ground,And then the mighty saint set forthAnd took his journey to the north.His pupils, deep in Scripture page,Followed behind the holy sage,And servants from the sacred groveA hundred wains for convoy drove.The very birds that winged that air,The very deer that harboured there,Forsook the glade and leafy brakeAnd followed for the hermit sake.They travelled far, till in the westThe sun was speeding to his rest,And made, their portioned journey o\\'er,Their halt on Sona(171) distant shore.The hermits bathed when sank the sun,And every rite was duly done,Oblations paid to Fire, and thenSate round their chief the holy men.Ráma and Lakshman lowly bowedIn reverence to the hermit crowd,And Ráma, having sate him downBefore the saint of pure renown,With humble palms together laidHis eager supplication made:\"What country, O my lord, is this,Fair-smiling in her wealth and bliss?Deign fully, O thou mighty Seer,To tell me, for I long to hear.\"Moved by the prayer of Ráma, heTold forth the country history.Canto XXXIV. Brahmadatta.\"A king of Brahmá seed who boreThe name of Kusa reigned of yore.Just, faithful to his vows, and true,He held the good in honour due.His bride, a queen of noble name,Of old Vidarbha(172) monarchs came.Like their own father, children four,All valiant boys, the lady bore.In glorious deeds each nerve they strained,And well their Warrior part sustained.To them most just, and true, and brave,Their father thus his counsel gave:\"Beloved children, ne\\'er forgetProtection is a prince debt:The noble work at once begin,High virtue and her fruits to win.\"The youths, to all the people dear,Received his speech with willing ear;And each went forth his several way,Foundations of a town to lay.Kusámba, prince of high renown,Was builder of Kausámbí town,And Kusanábha, just and wise,Bade high Mahodaya towers arise.Amúrtarajas chose to dwellIn Dharmáranya citadel,And Vasu bade his city fairThe name of Girivraja bear.(173)This fertile spot whereon we standWas once the high-souled Vasu land.Behold! as round we turn our eyes,Five lofty mountain peaks arise.See! bursting from her parent hill,Sumágadhí, a lovely rill,Bright gleaming as she flows betweenThe mountains, like a wreath is seen,And then through Magadh plains and grovesWith many a fair mćander roves.And this was Vasu old domain,The fertile Magadh broad champaign,Which smiling fields of tilth adornAnd diadem with golden corn.The queen Ghritáchí, nymph most fair,Married to Kusanábha, bareA hundred daughters, lovely-faced,With every charm and beauty graced.It chanced the maidens, bright and gayAs lightning-flashes on a dayOf rain time, to the garden wentWith song and play and merriment,And there in gay attire they strayed,And danced, and laughed, and sang, and played.The God of Wind who roves at willAll places, as he lists, to fill,Saw the young maidens dancing there,Of faultless shape and mien most fair.\"I love you all, sweet girls,\" he cried,\"And each shall be my darling bride.Forsake, forsake your mortal lot,And gain a life that withers not.A fickle thing is youth brief span,And more than all in mortal man.Receive unending youth, and beImmortal, O my loves, with me.\"The hundred girls, to wonder stirred,The wooing of the Wind-God heard,Laughed, as a jest, his suit aside,And with one voice they thus replied:\"O mighty Wind, free spirit whoAll life pervadest, through and through,Thy wondrous power we maidens know;Then wherefore wilt thou mock us so?Our sire is Kusanábha, King;And we, forsooth, have charms to bringA God to woo us from the skies;But honour first we maidens prize.Far may the hour, we pray, be hence,When we, O thou of little sense,Our truthful father choice refuse,And for ourselves our husbands choose.Our honoured sire our lord we deem,He is to us a God supreme,And they to whom his high decreeMay give us shall our husbands be.\"He heard the answer they returned,And mighty rage within him burned.On each fair maid a blast he sent:Each stately form he bowed and bent.Bent double by the Wind-God ireThey sought the palace of their sire,There fell upon the ground with sighs,While tears and shame were in their eyes.The king himself, with troubled brow,Saw his dear girls so fair but now,A mournful sight all bent and bowed,And grieving thus he cried aloud:\"What fate is this, and what the cause?What wretch has scorned all heavenly laws?Who thus your forms could curve and break?You struggle, but no answer make.\"They heard the speech of that wise kingOf their misfortune questioning.Again the hundred maidens sighed,Touched with their heads his feet, and cried:\"The God of Wind, pervading space,Would bring on us a foul disgrace,And choosing folly evil wayFrom virtue path in scorn would stray.But we in words like these reprovedThe God of Wind whom passion moved:\"Farewell, O Lord! A sire have we,No women uncontrolled and free.Go, and our sire consent obtainIf thou our maiden hands wouldst gain.No self-dependent life we live:If we offend, our fault forgive.\"But led by folly as a slave,He would not hear the rede we gave,And even as we gently spokeWe felt the Wind-God crushing stroke.\"The pious king, with grief distressed,The noble hundred thus addressed:\"With patience, daughters, bear your fate,Yours was a deed supremely greatWhen with one mind you kept from shameThe honour of your father name.Patience, when men their anger vent,Is woman praise and ornament;Yet when the Gods inflict the blowHard is it to support the woe.Patience, my girls, exceeds all price:\\'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice.Patience is virtue, patience fame:Patience upholds this earthly frame.And now, I think, is come the timeTo wed you in your maiden prime.Now, daughters, go where\\'er you will:Thoughts for your good my mind shall fill.\"The maidens went, consoled, away:The best of kings, that very day,Summoned his ministers of stateAbout their marriage to debate.Since then, because the Wind-God bentThe damsels\\' forms for punishment,That royal town is known to fameBy Kanyákubja(174) borrowed name.There lived a sage called Chúli then,Devoutest of the sons of men;His days in penance rites he spent,A glorious saint, most continent.To him absorbed in tasks austereThe child of Urmilá drew near,Sweet Somadá, the heavenly maidAnd lent the saint her pious aid.Long time near him the maiden spent,And served him meek and reverent,Till the great hermit, pleased with her,Thus spoke unto his minister:\"Grateful am I for all thy care:Blest maiden, speak, thy wish declare.\"The sweet-voiced nymph rejoiced to seeThe favour of the devotee,And to that eloquent old man,Most eloquent she thus began:\"Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,Close union with the Godhead gained.I long, O Saint, to see a sonBy force of holy penance won.Unwed, a maiden life I live:A son to me, thy suppliant, give.\"The saint with favour heard her prayer,And gave a son exceeding fair.Him, Chúli spiritual child,His mother Brahmadatta(175) styled.King Brahmadatta, rich and great,In Kámpilí maintained his state,Ruling, like Indra in his bliss,His fortunate metropolis.King Kusanábha planned that heHis hundred daughters\\' lord should be.To him, obedient to his call,The happy monarch gave them all.Like Indra then he took the handOf every maiden of the band.Soon as the hand of each young maidIn Brahmadatta palm was laid,Deformity and cares away,She shone in beauty bright and gay.Their freedom from the Wind-God mightSaw Kusanábha with delight.Each glance that on their forms he threwFilled him with raptures ever new.Then when the rites were all complete,With highest marks of honour meetThe bridegroom with his brides he sentTo his great seat of government.The nymph received with pleasant speechHer daughters; and, embracing each,Upon their forms she fondly gazed,And royal Kusanábha praised.Canto XXXV. Visvámitra Lineage.\"The rites were o\\'er, the maids were wed,The bridegroom to his home was sped.The sonless monarch bade prepareA sacrifice to gain an heir.Then Kusa, Brahmá son, appeared,And thus King Kusanábha cheered:\"Thou shalt, my child, obtain a sonLike thine own self, O holy one.Through him for ever, Gádhi named,Shalt thou in all the worlds be famed.\"He spoke, and vanished from the sightTo Brahmá world of endless light.Time fled, and, as the saint foretold,Gádhi was born, the holy-souled.My sire was he; through him I traceMy line from royal Kusa race.My sister--elder-born was she--The pure and good Satyavatí,(176)Was to the great Richíka wed.Still faithful to her husband dead,She followed him, most noble dame,And, raised to heaven in human frame,A pure celestial stream became.Down from Himálaya snowy height,In floods for ever fair and bright,My sister holy waves are hurledTo purify and glad the world.Now on Himálaya side I dwellBecause I love my sister well.She, for her faith and truth renowned,Most loving to her husband found,High-fated, firm in each pure vow,Is queen of all the rivers now.Bound by a vow I left her sideAnd to the Perfect convent hied.There, by the aid \\'twas thine to lend,Made perfect, all my labours end.Thus, mighty Prince, I now have toldMy race and lineage, high and old,And local tales of long agoWhich thou, O Ráma, fain wouldst know.As I have sate rehearsing thusThe midnight hour is come on us.Now, Ráma, sleep, that nothing mayOur journey of to-morrow stay.No leaf on any tree is stirred:Hushed in repose are beast and bird:Where\\'er you turn, on every side,Dense shades of night the landscape hide,The light of eve is fled: the skies,Thick-studded with their host of eyes,Seem a star-forest overhead,Where signs and constellations spread.Now rises, with his pure cold ray,The moon that drives the shades away,And with his gentle influence bringsJoy to the hearts of living things.Now, stealing from their lairs, appearThe beasts to whom the night is dear.Now spirits walk, and every powerThat revels in the midnight hour.\"The mighty hermit tale was o\\'er,He closed his lips and spoke no more.The holy men on every side,\"Well done! well done,\" with reverence cried;\"The mighty men of Kusa seedWere ever famed for righteous deed.Like Brahmá self in glory shineThe high-souled lords of Kusa line,And thy great name is sounded most,O Saint, amid the noble host.And thy dear sister--fairest sheOf streams, the high-born Kausikí--Diffusing virtue where she flows,New splendour on thy lineage throws.\"Thus by the chief of saints addressedThe son of Gádhi turned to rest;So, when his daily course is done,Sinks to his rest the beaming sun.Ráma with Lakshman, somewhat stirredTo marvel by the tales they heard,Turned also to his couch, to closeHis eyelids in desired repose.Canto XXXVI. The Birth Of Gangá.The hours of night now waning fastOn Sona pleasant shore they passed.Then, when the dawn began to break,To Ráma thus the hermit spake:\"The light of dawn is breaking clear,The hour of morning rites is near.Rise, Ráma, rise, dear son, I pray,And make thee ready for the way.\"Then Ráma rose, and finished allHis duties at the hermit call,Prepared with joy the road to take,And thus again in question spake:\"Here fair and deep the Sona flows,And many an isle its bosom shows:What way, O Saint, will lead us o\\'erAnd land us on the farther shore?\"The saint replied: \"The way I chooseIs that which pious hermits use.\"For many a league they journeyed onTill, when the sun of mid-day shone,The hermit-haunted flood was seenOf Jáhnaví,(177) the Rivers\\' Queen.Soon as the holy stream they viewed,Thronged with a white-winged multitudeOf sárases(178) and swans,(179) delightPossessed them at the lovely sight;And then prepared the hermit bandTo halt upon that holy strand.They bathed as Scripture bids, and paidOblations due to God and shade.To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet.Then pure and pleased they sate aroundSaint Visvámitra on the ground.The holy men of lesser note,In due degree, sate more remote,While Raghu sons took nearer placeBy virtue of their rank and race.Then Ráma said: \"O Saint, I yearnThe three-pathed Gangá tale to learn.\"Thus urged, the sage recounted bothThe birth of Gangá and her growth:\"The mighty hill with metals stored,Himálaya, is the mountains\\' lord,The father of a lovely pairOf daughters fairest of the fair:Their mother, offspring of the willOf Meru, everlasting hill,Mená, Himálaya darling, gracedWith beauty of her dainty waist.Gangá was elder-born: then cameThe fair one known by Umá name.Then all the Gods of heaven, in needOf Gangá help their vows to speed,To great Himálaya came and prayedThe mountain King to yield the maid.He, not regardless of the wealOf the three worlds, with holy zealHis daughter to the Immortals gave,Gangá whose waters cleanse and save,Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,Purging all sinners, to the sea.The three-pathed Gangá thus obtained,The Gods their heavenly homes regained.Long time the sister Umá passedIn vows austere and rigid fast,And the king gave the devoteeImmortal Rudra(180) bride to be,Matching with that unequalled LordHis Umá through the worlds adored.So now a glorious station fillsEach daughter of the King of Hills:One honoured as the noblest stream,One mid the Goddesses supreme.Thus Gangá, King Himálaya child,The heavenly river, undefiled,Rose bearing with her to the skyHer waves that bless and purify.\"[I am compelled to omit Cantos XXXVII and XXXVIII, THE GLORY OF UMÁ, andTHE BIRTH OF KÁRTIKEYA, as both in subject and language offensive tomodern taste.

The Sons Of Sagar.The saint in accents sweet and clearThus told his tale for Ráma ear,And thus anew the holy manA legend to the prince began:\"There reigned a pious monarch o\\'erAyodhyá in the days of yore:Sagar his name: no child had he,And children much he longed to see.His honoured consort, fair of face,Sprang from Vidarbha royal race,Kesini, famed from early youthFor piety and love of truth.Aríshtanemi daughter fair,With whom no maiden might compareIn beauty, though the earth is wide,Sumati, was his second bride.With his two queens afar he went,And weary days in penance spent,Fervent, upon Himálaya hillWhere springs the stream called Bhrigu\\' rill.Nor did he fail that saint to pleaseWith his devout austerities.And, when a hundred years had fled,Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said:\"From thee, O Sagar, blameless King,A mighty host of sons shall spring,And thou shalt win a glorious nameWhich none, O Chief, but thou shall claim.One of thy queens a son shall bear,Maintainer of thy race and heir;And of the other there shall beSons sixty thousand born to thee.\"Thus as he spake, with one accord,To win the grace of that high lord,The queens, with palms together laid,In humble supplication prayed:\"Which queen, O Bráhman, of the pair,The many, or the one shall bear?Most eager, Lord, are we to know,And as thou sayest be it so.\"With his sweet speech the saint replied:\"Yourselves, O Queens, the choice decide.Your own discretion freely useWhich shall the one or many choose:One shall the race and name uphold,The host be famous, strong, and bold.Which will have which?\" Then KesiniThe mother of one heir would be.Sumati, sister of the king(181)Of all the birds that ply the wing,To that illustrious Bráhman suedThat she might bear the multitudeWhose fame throughout the world should soundFor mighty enterprise renowned.Around the saint the monarch went,Bowing his head, most reverent.Then with his wives, with willing feet,Resought his own imperial seat.Time passed. The elder consort bareA son called Asamanj, the heir.Then Sumati, the younger, gaveBirth to a gourd,(182) O hero brave,Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,Gave sixty thousand babes to view.All these with care the nurses laidIn jars of oil; and there they stayed,Till, youthful age and strength complete,Forth speeding from each dark retreat,All peers in valour, years, and might,The sixty thousand came to light.Prince Asamanj, brought up with care,Scourge of his foes, was made the heir.But liegemen boys he used to castTo Sarjú waves that hurried past,Laughing the while in cruel gleeTheir dying agonies to see.This wicked prince who aye withstoodThe counsel of the wise and good,Who plagued the people in his hate,His father banished from the state.His son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,Was Ansumán, beloved of all.Long years flew by. The king decreedTo slay a sacrificial steed.Consulting with his priestly bandHe vowed the rite his soul had planned,And, Veda skilled, by their adviceMade ready for the sacrifice.Canto XL. The Cleaving Of The Earth.The hermit ceased: the tale was done:Then in a transport Raghu sonAgain addressed the ancient sireResplendent as a burning fire:\"O holy man, I fain would hearThe tale repeated full and clearHow he from whom my sires descendBrought the great rite to happy end.\"The hermit answered with a smile:\"Then listen, son of Raghu, whileMy legendary tale proceedsTo tell of high-souled Sagar deeds.Within the spacious plain that liesFrom where Himálaya heights ariseTo where proud Vindhya rival chainLooks down upon the subject plain--A land the best for rites declared(183)--His sacrifice the king prepared.And Ansumán the prince--for soSagar advised--with ready bowWas borne upon a mighty carTo watch the steed who roamed afar.But Indra, monarch of the skies,Veiling his form in demon guise,Came down upon the appointed dayAnd drove the victim horse away.Reft of the steed the priests, distressed,The master of the rite addressed:\"Upon the sacred day by forceA robber takes the victim horse.Haste, King! now let the thief be slain;Bring thou the charger back again:The sacred rite prevented thusBrings scathe and woe to all of us.Rise, monarch, and provide with speedThat naught its happy course impede.\"King Sagar in his crowded courtGave ear unto the priests\\' report.He summoned straightway to his sideHis sixty thousand sons, and cried:\"Brave sons of mine, I knew not howThese demons are so mighty now:The priests began the rite so wellAll sanctified with prayer and spell.If in the depths of earth he hide,Or lurk beneath the ocean tide,Pursue, dear sons, the robber track;Slay him and bring the charger back.The whole of this broad earth explore,Sea-garlanded, from shore to shore:Yea, dig her up with might and mainUntil you see the horse again.Deep let your searching labour reach,A league in depth dug out by each.The robber of our horse pursue,And please your sire who orders you.My grandson, I, this priestly train,Till the steed comes, will here remain.\"Their eager hearts with transport burnedAs to their task the heroes turned.Obedient to their father, theyThrough earth recesses forced their way.With iron arms\\' unflinching toilEach dug a league beneath the soil.Earth, cleft asunder, groaned in pain,As emulous they plied amainSharp-pointed coulter, pick, and bar,Hard as the bolts of Indra are.Then loud the horrid clamour roseOf monsters dying neath their blows,Giant and demon, fiend and snake,That in earth core their dwelling make.They dug, in ire that naught could stay,Through sixty thousand leagues their way,Cleaving the earth with matchless strengthTill hell itself they reached at length.Thus digging searched they Jambudvip(184)With all its hills and mountains steep.Then a great fear began to shakeThe heart of God, bard, fiend, and snake,And all distressed in spirit wentBefore the Sire Omnipotent.With signs of woe in every faceThey sought the mighty Father grace,And trembling still and ill at easeAddressed their Lord in words like these:\"The sons of Sagar, Sire benign,Pierce the whole earth with mine on mine,And as their ruthless work they plyInnumerable creatures die.\"This is the thief,\" the princes say,\"Who stole our victim steed away.This marred the rite, and caused us ill,And so their guiltless blood they spill.\"Canto XLI. Kapil.The father lent a gracious earAnd listened to their tale of fear,And kindly to the Gods repliedWhom woe and death had terrified:\"The wisest Vásudeva,(185) whoThe Immortals\\' foe, fierce Madhu, slew,Regards broad Earth with love and prideAnd guards, in Kapil form, his bride.(186)His kindled wrath will quickly fallOn the king sons and burn them all.This cleaving of the earth his eyeForesaw in ages long gone by:He knew with prescient soul the fateThat Sagar children should await.\"The Three-and-thirty,(187) freed from fear,Sought their bright homes with hopeful cheer.Still rose the great tempestuous soundAs Sagar children pierced the ground.When thus the whole broad earth was cleft,And not a spot unsearched was left,Back to their home the princes sped,And thus unto their father said:\"We searched the earth from side to side,While countless hosts of creatures died.Our conquering feet in triumph trodOn snake and demon, fiend and God;But yet we failed, with all our toil,To find the robber and the spoil.What can we more? If more we can,Devise, O King, and tell thy plan.\"His children speech King Sagar heard,And answered thus, to anger stirred:\"Dig on, and ne\\'er your labour stayTill through earth depths you force your way.Then smite the robber dead, and bringThe charger back with triumphing.\"The sixty thousand chiefs obeyed:Deep through the earth their way they made.Deep as they dug and deeper yetThe immortal elephant they met,Famed Vírúpáksha(188) vast of size,Upon whose head the broad earth lies:The mighty beast who earth sustainsWith shaggy hills and wooded plains.When, with the changing moon, distressed,And longing for a moment rest,His mighty head the monster shakes,Earth to the bottom reels and quakes.Around that warder strong and vastWith reverential steps they passed.Nor, when the honour due was paid,Their downward search through earth delayed.But turning from the east asideSouthward again their task they plied.There Mahápadma held his place,The best of all his mighty race,Like some huge hill, of monstrous girth,Upholding on his head the earth.When the vast beast the princes saw,They marvelled and were filled with awe.The sons of high-souled Sagar roundThat elephant in reverence wound.Then in the western region theyWith might unwearied cleft their way.There saw they with astonisht eyesSaumanas, beast of mountain size.Round him with circling steps they wentWith greetings kind and reverent.On, on--no thought of rest or stay--They reached the seat of Soma sway.There saw they Bhadra, white as snow,With lucky marks that fortune show,Bearing the earth upon his head.Round him they paced with solemn tread,And honoured him with greetings kind,Then downward yet their way they mined.They gained the tract \\'twixt east and northWhose fame is ever blazoned forth,(189)And by a storm of rage impelled,Digging through earth their course they held.Then all the princes, lofty-souled,Of wondrous vigour, strong and bold,Saw Vásudeva(190) standing thereIn Kapil form he loved to wear,And near the everlasting GodThe victim charger cropped the sod.They saw with joy and eager eyesThe fancied robber and the prize,And on him rushed the furious bandCrying aloud, Stand, villain! stand!\"Avaunt! avaunt!\" great Kapil cried,His bosom flusht with passion tide;Then by his might that proud arrayAll scorcht to heaps of ashes lay.(191)Canto XLII. Sagar Sacrifice.Then to the prince his grandson, brightWith his own fame unborrowed light,King Sagar thus began to say,Marvelling at his sons\\' delay:\"Thou art a warrior skilled and bold,Match for the mighty men of old.Now follow on thine uncles\\' courseAnd track the robber of the horse.To guard thee take thy sword and bow,for huge and strong are beasts below.There to the reverend reverence pay,And kill the foes who check thy way;Then turn successful home and seeMy sacrifice complete through thee.\"Obedient to the high-souled lordGrasped Ansumán his bow and sword,And hurried forth the way to traceWith youth and valour eager pace.On sped he by the path he foundDug by his uncles underground.The warder elephant he sawWhose size and strength pass Nature law,Who bears the world tremendous weight,Whom God, fiend, giant venerate,Bird, serpent, and each flitting shade,To him the honour meet he paidWith circling steps and greeting due,And further prayed him, if he knew,To tell him of his uncles\\' weal,And who had dared the horse to steal.To him in war and council triedThe warder elephant replied:\"Thou, son of Asamanj, shalt leadIn triumph back the rescued steed.\"As to each warder beast he cameAnd questioned all, his words the same,The honoured youth with gentle speechDrew eloquent reply from each,That fortune should his steps attend,And with the horse he home should wend.Cheered with the grateful answer, hePassed on with step more light and free,And reached with careless heart the placeWhere lay in ashes Sagar race.Then sank the spirit of the chiefBeneath that shock of sudden grief,And with a bitter cry of woeHe mourned his kinsmen fallen so.He saw, weighed down by woe and care,The victim charger roaming there.Yet would the pious chieftain fainOblations offer to the slain:But, needing water for the rite,He looked and there was none in sightHis quick eye searching all aroundThe uncle of his kinsmen found,King Garud, best beyond compareOf birds who wing the fields of air.Then thus unto the weeping manThe son of Vinatá(192) began:\"Grieve not, O hero, for their fallWho died a death approved of all.Of mighty strength, they met their fateBy Kapil hand whom none can mate.Pour forth for them no earthly wave,A holier flood their spirits crave.If, daughter of the Lord of Snow,Gangá would turn her stream below,Her waves that cleanse all mortal stainWould wash their ashes pure again.Yea, when her flood whom all revereRolls o\\'er the dust that moulders here,The sixty thousand, freed from sin,A home in Indra heaven shall win.Go, and with ceaseless labour tryTo draw the Goddess from the sky.Return, and with thee take the steed;So shall thy grandsire rite succeed.\"Prince Ansumán the strong and braveFollowed the rede Suparna(193) gave.The glorious hero took the horse,And homeward quickly bent his course.Straight to the anxious king he hied,Whom lustral rites had purified,The mournful story to unfoldAnd all the king of birds had told.The tale of woe the monarch heard,Nor longer was the rite deferred:With care and just observance heAccomplished all, as texts decree.The rites performed, with brighter fame,Mighty in counsel, home he came.He longed to bring the river down,But found no plan his wish to crown.He pondered long with anxious thoughtBut saw no way to what he sought.Thus thirty thousand years he spent,And then to heaven the monarch went.Canto XLIII. Bhagírath.When Sagar thus had bowed to fate,The lords and commons of the stateApproved with ready heart and willPrince Ansumán his throne to fill.He ruled, a mighty king, unblamed,Sire of Dilípa justly famed.To him, his child and worthy heir,The king resigned his kingdom care,And on Himálaya pleasant sideHis task austere of penance plied.Bright as a God in clear renownHe planned to bring pure Gangá down.There on his fruitless hope intentTwice sixteen thousand years he spent,And in the grove of hermits stayedTill bliss in heaven his rites repaid.Dilípa then, the good and great,Soon as he learnt his kinsmen fate,Bowed down by woe, with troubled mind,Pondering long no cure could find.\"How can I bring,\" the mourner sighed,\"To cleanse their dust, the heavenly tide?How can I give them rest, and saveTheir spirits with the offered wave?\"Long with this thought his bosom skilledIn holy discipline was filled.A son was born, Bhagírath named,Above all men for virtue famed.Dilípa many a rite ordained,And thirty thousand seasons reigned.But when no hope the king could seeHis kinsmen from their woe to free,The lord of men, by sickness tried,Obeyed the law of fate, and died;He left the kingdom to his son,And gained the heaven his deeds had won.The good Bhagírath, royal sage,Had no fair son to cheer his age.He, great in glory, pure in will,Longing for sons was childless still.Then on one wish, one thought intent,Planning the heavenly stream descent,Leaving his ministers the careAnd burden of his state to bear,Dwelling in far Gokarna(194) heEngaged in long austerity.With senses checked, with arms upraised,Five fires(195) around and o\\'er him blazed.Each weary month the hermit passedBreaking but once his awful fast.In winter chill the brook his bed,In rain, the clouds to screen his head.Thousands of years he thus enduredTill Brahmá favour was assured,And the high Lord of living thingsLooked kindly on his sufferings.With trooping Gods the Sire came nearThe king who plied his task austere:\"Blest Monarch, of a glorious race,Thy fervent rites have won my grace.Well hast thou wrought thine awful task:Some boon in turn, O Hermit, ask.\"Bhagírath, rich in glory light,The hero with the arm of might,Thus to the Lord of earth and skyRaised suppliant hands and made reply:\"If the great God his favour deigns,And my long toil its fruit obtains,Let Sagar sons receive from meLibations that they long to see.Let Gangá with her holy waveThe ashes of the heroes lave,That so my kinsmen may ascendTo heavenly bliss that ne\\'er shall end.And give, I pray, O God, a son,Nor let my house be all undone.Sire of the worlds! be this the graceBestowed upon Ikshváku race.\"The Sire, when thus the king had prayed,In sweet kind words his answer made.\"High, high thy thought and wishes are,Bhagírath of the mighty car!Ikshváku line is blest in thee,And as thou prayest it shall be.Gangá, whose waves in Swarga(196) flow,Is daughter of the Lord of Snow.Win Siva that his aid be lentTo hold her in her mid descent,For earth alone will never bearThose torrents hurled from upper air;And none may hold her weight but He,The Trident wielding deity.\"Thus having said, the Lord supremeAddressed him to the heavenly stream;And then with Gods and Maruts(197) wentTo heaven above the firmament.Canto XLIV. The Descent Of Gangá.The Lord of life the skies regained:The fervent king a year remainedWith arms upraised, refusing restWhile with one toe the earth he pressed,Still as a post, with sleepless eye,The air his food, his roof the sky.The year had past. Then Umá lord,(198)King of creation, world adored,Thus spoke to great Bhagírath: \"I,Well pleased thy wish will gratify,And on my head her waves shall flingThe daughter of the Mountains\\' King!\"He stood upon the lofty crestThat crowns the Lord of Snow,And bade the river of the BlestDescend on earth below.Himálaya child, adored of all,The haughty mandate heard,And her proud bosom, at the call,With furious wrath was stirred.Down from her channel in the skiesWith awful might she spedWith a giant rush, in a giant size,On Siva holy head.\"He calls me,\" in her wrath she cried,\"And all my flood shall sweepAnd whirl him in its whelming tideTo hell profoundest deep.\"He held the river on his head,And kept her wandering, where,Dense as Himálaya woods, were spreadThe tangles of his hair.No way to earth she found, ashamed,Though long and sore she strove,Condemned, until her pride were tamed,Amid his locks to rove.There, many lengthening seasons through,The wildered river ran:Bhagírath saw it, and anewHis penance dire began.Then Siva, for the hermit sake,Bade her long wanderings end,And sinking into Vindu lakeHer weary waves descend.From Gangá, by the God set free,Seven noble rivers came;Hládiní, Pávaní, and sheCalled Naliní by name:These rolled their lucid waves alongAnd sought the eastern side.Suchakshu, Sítá fair and strong,And Sindhu mighty tide--(199)These to the region of the westWith joyful waters sped:The seventh, the brightest and the best,Flowed where Bhagírath led.On Siva head descending firstA rest the torrents found:Then down in all their might they burstAnd roared along the ground.On countless glittering scales the beamOf rosy morning flashed,Where fish and dolphins through the streamFallen and falling dashed.Then bards who chant celestial laysAnd nymphs of heavenly birthFlocked round upon that flood to gazeThat streamed from sky to earth.The Gods themselves from every sphere,Incomparably bright,Borne in their golden cars drew nearTo see the wondrous sight.The cloudless sky was all aflameWith the light of a hundred sunsWhere\\'er the shining chariots cameThat bore those holy ones.So flashed the air with crested snakesAnd fish of every hueAs when the lightning glory breaksThrough fields of summer blue.And white foam-clouds and silver sprayWere wildly tossed on high,Like swans that urge their homeward wayAcross the autumn sky.Now ran the river calm and clearWith current strong and deep:Now slowly broadened to a mere,Or scarcely seemed to creep.Now o\\'er a length of sandy plainHer tranquil course she held;Now rose her waves and sank again,By refluent waves repelled.So falling first on Siva head,Thence rushing to their earthly bed,In ceaseless fall the waters streamed,And pure with holy lustre gleamed.Then every spirit, sage, and bard,Condemned to earth by sentence hard,Pressed eagerly around the tideThat Siva touch had sanctified.Then they whom heavenly doom had hurled,Accursed, to this lower world,Touched the pure wave, and freed from sinResought the skies and entered in.And all the world was glad, whereonThe glorious water flowed and shone,For sin and stain were banished thenceBy the sweet river influence.First, in a car of heavenly frame,The royal saint of deathless name,Bhagírath, very glorious rode,And after him fair Gangá flowed.God, sage, and bard, the chief in placeOf spirits and the Nága race,Nymph, giant, fiend, in long arraySped where Bhagírath led the way;And all the hosts the flood that swimFollowed the stream that followed him.Where\\'er the great Bhagírath led,There ever glorious Gangá fled,The best of floods, the rivers\\' queen,Whose waters wash the wicked clean.It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,Engaged with holy offerings stood;The river spread her waves aroundFlooding his sacrificial ground.The saint in anger marked her pride,And at one draught her stream he dried.Then God, and sage, and bard, afraid,To noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,And begged that he would kindly deemHis own dear child that holy stream.Moved by their suit, he soothed their fearsAnd loosed her waters from his ears.Hence Gangá through the world is styledBoth Jáhnavi and Jahnu child.Then onward still she followed fast,And reached the great sea bank at last.Thence deep below her way she madeTo end those rites so long delayed.The monarch reached the Ocean side,And still behind him Gangá hied.He sought the depths which open layWhere Sagar sons had dug their way.So leading through earth nether cavesThe river purifying waves,Over his kinsmen dust the lordHis funeral libation poured.Soon as the flood their dust bedewed,Their spirits gained beatitude,And all in heavenly bodies dressedRose to the skies\\' eternal rest.Then thus to King Bhagírath saidBrahmá, when, coming at the headOf all his bright celestial train,He saw those spirits freed from stain:\"Well done! great Prince of men, well done!Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.The sons of Sagar mighty-souled,Are with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,Long as the Ocean flood shall standUpon the border of the land,So long shall Sagar sons remain,And, godlike, rank in heaven retain.Gangá thine eldest child shall be,Called from thy name Bhágirathí;Named also--for her waters fellFrom heaven and flow through earth and hell--Tripathagá, stream of the skies,Because three paths she glorifies.And, mighty King, \\'tis given thee nowTo free thee and perform thy vow.No longer, happy Prince, delayDrink-offerings to thy kin to pay.For this the holiest Sagar sighed,But mourned the boon he sought denied.Then Ansumán, dear Prince! althoughNo brighter name the world could show,Strove long the heavenly flood to gainTo visit earth, but strove in vain.Nor was she by the sages\\' peer,Blest with all virtues, most austere,Thy sire Dilípa, hither brought,Though with fierce prayers the boon he sought.But thou, O King, earned success,And won high fame which God will bless.Through thee, O victor of thy foes,On earth this heavenly Gangá flows,And thou hast gained the meed divineThat waits on virtue such as thine.Now in her ever holy waveThyself, O best of heroes, lave:So shalt thou, pure from every sin,The blessed fruit of merit win.Now for thy kin who died of yoreThe meet libations duly pour.Above the heavens I now ascend:Depart, and bliss thy steps attend.\"Thus to the mighty king who brokeHis foemens\\' might, Lord Brahmá spoke,And with his Gods around him roseTo his own heaven of blest repose.The royal sage no more delayed,But, the libation duly paid,Home to his regal city hiedWith water cleansed and purified.There ruled he his ancestral state,Best of all men, most fortunate.And all the people joyed againIn good Bhagírath gentle reign.Rich, prosperous, and blest were they,And grief and sickness fled away.Thus, Ráma, I at length have toldHow Gangá came from heaven of old.Now, for the evening passes swift,I wish thee each auspicious gift.This story of the flood descentWill give--for \\'tis most excellent--Wealth, purity, fame, length of days,And to the skies its hearers raise\"Canto XLV. The Quest Of The Amrit.High and more high their wonder roseAs the strange story reached its close,And thus, with Lakshman, Ráma, bestOf Raghu sons, the saint addressed:\"Most wondrous is the tale which thouHast told of heavenly Gangá, howFrom realms above descending sheFlowed through the land and filled the sea.In thinking o\\'er what thou hast saidThe night has like a moment fled,Whose hours in musing have been spentUpon thy words most excellent:So much, O holy Sage, thy loreHas charmed us with this tale of yore.\"Day dawned. The morning rites were doneAnd the victorious Raghu sonAddressed the sage in words like these,Rich in his long austerities:\"The night is past: the morn is clear;Told is the tale so good to hear:Now o\\'er that river let us go,Three-pathed, the best of all that flow.This boat stands ready on the shoreTo bear the holy hermits o\\'er,Who of thy coming warned, in haste,The barge upon the bank have placed.\"And Kusik son approved his speech,And moving to the sandy beach,Placed in the boat the hermit band,And reached the river further strand.On the north bank their feet they set,And greeted all the saints they met.On Gangá shore they lighted down,And saw Visálá lovely town.Thither, the princes by his side,The best of holy hermits hied.It was a town exceeding fairThat might with heaven itself compare.Then, suppliant palm to palm applied,Famed Ráma asked his holy guide:\"O best of hermits, say what raceOf monarchs rules this lovely place.Dear master, let my prayer prevail,For much I long to hear the tale.\"Moved by his words, the saintly manVisálá ancient tale began:\"List, Ráma, list, with closest heedThe tale of Indra wondrous deed,And mark me as I truly tellWhat here in ancient days befell.Ere Krita famous Age(200) had fled,Strong were the sons of Diti(201) bred;And Aditi brave children tooWere very mighty, good, and true.The rival brothers fierce and boldWere sons of Kasyap lofty-souled.Of sister mothers born, they vied,Brood against brood, in jealous pride.Once, as they say, band met with band,And, joined in awful council, plannedTo live, unharmed by age and time,Immortal in their youthful prime.Then this was, after due debate,The counsel of the wise and great,To churn with might the milky sea(202)The life-bestowing drink to free.This planned, they seized the Serpent King,Vásuki, for their churning-string,And Mandar mountain for their pole,And churned with all their heart and soul.As thus, a thousand seasons through,This way and that the snake they drew,Biting the rocks, each tortured head,A very deadly venom shed.Thence, bursting like a mighty flame,A pestilential poison came,Consuming, as it onward ran,The home of God, and fiend, and man.Then all the suppliant Gods in fearTo Sankar,(203) mighty lord, drew near.To Rudra, King of Herds, dismayed,\"Save us, O save us, Lord!\" they prayed.Then Vishnu, bearing shell, and mace,And discus, showed his radiant face,And thus addressed in smiling gleeThe Trident wielding deity:\"What treasure first the Gods upturnFrom troubled Ocean, as they churn,Should--for thou art the eldest--beConferred, O best of Gods, on thee.Then come, and for thy birthright sake,This venom as thy first fruits take.\"He spoke, and vanished from their sight,When Siva saw their wild affright,And heard his speech by whom is borneThe mighty bow of bending horn,(204)The poisoned flood at once he quaffedAs \\'twere the Amrit heavenly draught.Then from the Gods departing wentSiva, the Lord pre-eminent.The host of Gods and Asurs stillKept churning with one heart and will.But Mandar mountain, whirling round,Pierced to the depths below the ground.Then Gods and bards in terror flewTo him who mighty Madhu slew.\"Help of all beings! more than all,The Gods on thee for aid may call.Ward off, O mighty-armed! our fate,And bear up Mandar threatening weight.\"Then Vishnu, as their need was sore,The semblance of a tortoise wore,And in the bed of Ocean layThe mountain on his back to stay.Then he, the soul pervading all,Whose locks in radiant tresses fall,One mighty arm extended still,And grasped the summit of the hill.So ranged among the Immortals, heJoined in the churning of the sea.A thousand years had reached their close,When calmly from the ocean roseThe gentle sage(205) with staff and can,Lord of the art of healing man.Then as the waters foamed and boiled,As churning still the Immortals toiled,Of winning face and lovely frame,Forth sixty million fair ones came.Born of the foam and water, theseWere aptly named Apsarases.(206)Each had her maids. The tongue would fail--So vast the throng--to count the tale.But when no God or Titan wooedA wife from all that multitude,Refused by all, they gave their loveIn common to the Gods above.Then from the sea still vext and wildRose Surá,(207) Varun maiden child.A fitting match she sought to find:But Diti sons her love declined,Their kinsmen of the rival broodTo the pure maid in honour sued.Hence those who loved that nymph so fairThe hallowed name of Suras bear.And Asurs are the Titan crowdHer gentle claims who disallowed.Then from the foamy sea was freedUchchaihsravas,(208) the generous steed,And Kaustubha, of gems the gem,(209)And Soma, Moon God, after them.At length when many a year had fled,Up floated, on her lotus bed,A maiden fair and tender-eyed,In the young flush of beauty pride.She shone with pearl and golden sheen,And seals of glory stamped her queen,On each round arm glowed many a gem,On her smooth brows, a diadem.Rolling in waves beneath her crownThe glory of her hair flowed down,Pearls on her neck of price untold,The lady shone like burnisht gold.Queen of the Gods, she leapt to land,A lotus in her perfect hand,And fondly, of the lotus-sprung,To lotus-bearing Vishnu clung.Her Gods above and men belowAs Beauty Queen and Fortune know.(210)Gods, Titans, and the minstrel trainStill churned and wrought the troubled main.At length the prize so madly sought,The Amrit, to their sight was brought.For the rich spoil, \\'twixt these and thoseA fratricidal war arose,And, host \\'gainst host in battle, set,Aditi sons and Diti met.United, with the giants\\' aid,Their fierce attack the Titans made,And wildly raged for many a dayThat universe-astounding fray.When wearied arms were faint to strike,And ruin threatened all alike,Vishnu, with art illusive aid,The Amrit from their sight conveyed.That Best of Beings smote his foesWho dared his deathless arm oppose:Yea, Vishnu, all-pervading God,Beneath his feet the Titans trodAditi race, the sons of light,slew Diti brood in cruel fight.Then town-destroying(211) Indra gainedHis empire, and in glory reignedO\\'er the three worlds with bard and sageRejoicing in his heritage.Canto XLVI. Diti Hope.But Diti, when her sons were slain,Wild with a childless mother pain,To Kasyap spake, Marícha son,Her husband: \"O thou glorious one!Dead are the children, mine no more,The mighty sons to thee I bore.Long fervour meed, I crave a boyWhose arm may Indra life destroy.The toil and pain my care shall be:To bless my hope depends on thee.Give me a mighty son to slayFierce Indra, gracious lord! I pray.\"Then glorious Kasyap thus repliedTo Diti, as she wept and sighed:\"Thy prayer is heard, dear saint! RemainPure from all spot, and thou shalt gainA son whose arm shall take the lifeOf Indra in the battle strife.For full a thousand years endureFree from all stain, supremely pure;Then shall thy son and mine appear,Whom the three worlds shall serve with fear.\"These words the glorious Kasyap said,Then gently stroked his consort head,Blessed her, and bade a kind adieu,And turned him to his rites anew.Soon as her lord had left her side,Her bosom swelled with joy and pride.She sought the shade of holy boughs,And there began her awful vows.While yet she wrought her rites austere,Indra, unbidden, hastened near,With sweet observance tending her,A reverential minister.Wood, water, fire, and grass he brought,Sweet roots and woodland fruit he sought,And all her wants, the Thousand-eyed,With never-failing care, supplied,With tender love and soft caressRemoving pain and weariness.When, of the thousand years ordained,Ten only unfulfilled remained,Thus to her son, the Thousand-eyed,The Goddess in her triumph cried:\"Best of the mighty! there remainBut ten short years of toil and pain;These years of penance soon will flee,And a new brother thou shalt see.Him for thy sake I\\'ll nobly breed,And lust of war his soul shall feed;Then free from care and sorrow thouShalt see the worlds before him bow.\"(212)Canto XLVII. Sumati.Thus to Lord Indra, Thousand-eyed,Softly beseeching Diti sighed.When but a blighted bud was left,Which Indra hand in seven had cleft:(213)\"No fault, O Lord of Gods, is thine;The blame herein is only mine.But for one grace I fain would pray,As thou hast reft this hope away.This bud, O Indra, which a blightHas withered ere it saw the light--From this may seven fair spirits riseTo rule the regions of the skies.Be theirs through heaven unbounded spaceOn shoulders of the winds to race,My children, drest in heavenly forms,Far-famed as Maruts, Gods of storms.One God to Brahmá sphere assign,Let one, O Indra, watch o\\'er thine;And ranging through the lower air,The third the name of Váyu(214) bear.Gods let the four remaining be,And roam through space, obeying thee.\"The Town-destroyer, Thousand-eyed,Who smote fierce Bali till he died,Joined suppliant hands, and thus replied:\"Thy children heavenly forms shall wear;The names devised by thee shall bear,And, Maruts called by my decree,Shall Amrit drink and wait on me.From fear and age and sickness freed,Through the three worlds their wings shall speed.\"Thus in the hermits\\' holy shadeMother and son their compact made,And then, as fame relates, content,Home to the happy skies they went.This is the spot--so men have told--Where Lord Mahendra(215) dwelt of old,This is the blessed region whereHis votaress mother claimed his care.Here gentle Alambúshá bareTo old Ikshváku, king and sage,Visála, glory of his age,By whom, a monarch void of guilt,Was this fair town Visálá built.His son was Hemachandra, stillRenowned for might and warlike skill.From him the great Suchandra came;His son, Dhúmrásva, dear to fame.Next followed royal Srinjay; thenFamed Sahadeva, lord of men.Next came Kusásva, good and mild,Whose son was Somadatta styled,And Sumati, his heir, the peerOf Gods above, now governs here.And ever through Ikshváku grace,Visálá kings, his noble race,Are lofty-souled, and blest with lengthOf days, with virtue, and with strength.This night, O prince, we here will sleep;And when the day begins to peep,Our onward way will take with thee,The king of Míthilá to see.\"Then Sumati, the king, awareOf Visvámitra advent there,Came quickly forth with honour meetThe lofty-minded sage to greet.Girt with his priest and lords the kingDid low obeisance, worshipping,With suppliant hands, with head inclined,Thus spoke he after question kind;\"Since thou hast deigned to bless my sight,And grace awhile thy servant seat,High fate is mine, great Anchorite,And none may with my bliss compete.\"Canto XLVIII. Indra And AhalyáWhen mutual courtesies had past,Visálá ruler spoke at last:\"These princely youths, O Sage, who vieIn might with children of the sky,Heroic, born for happy fate,With elephants\\' or lions\\' gait,Bold as the tiger or the bull,With lotus eyes so large and full,Armed with the quiver, sword, and bow,Whose figures like the Asvins(216) show,Like children of the deathless Powers,Come freely to these shades of ours,(217)--How have they reached on foot this place?What do they seek, and what their race?As sun and moon adorn the sky,This spot the heroes glorify.Alike in stature, port, and mien,The same fair form in each is seen,\"He spoke; and at the monarch callThe best of hermits told him all,How in the grove with him they dwelt,And slaughter to the demons dealt.Then wonder filled the monarch breast,Who tended well each royal guest.Thus entertained, the princely pairRemained that night and rested there,And with the morn returning rayTo Mithilá pursued their way.When Janak lovely city firstUpon their sight, yet distant, burst,The hermits all with joyful criesHailed the fair town that met their eyes.Then Ráma saw a holy wood,Close, in the city neighbourhood,O\\'ergrown, deserted, marked by age,And thus addressed the mighty sage:\"O reverend lord. I long to knowWhat hermit dwelt here long ago.\"Then to the prince his holy guide,Most eloquent of men, replied:\"O Ráma, listen while I tellWhose was this grove, and what befellWhen in the fury of his rageThe high saint cursed the hermitage.This was the grove--most lovely then--Of Gautam, O thou best of men,Like heaven itself, most honoured byThe Gods who dwell above the sky.Here with Ahalyá at his sideHis fervid task the ascetic plied.Years fled in thousands. On a dayIt chanced the saint had gone away,When Town-destroying Indra came,And saw the beauty of the dame.The sage form the God endued,And thus the fair Ahalyá wooed:\"Love, sweet! should brook no dull delayBut snatch the moments when he may.\"She knew him in the saint disguise,Lord Indra of the Thousand Eyes,But touched by love unholy fire,She yielded to the God desire.\"Now, Lord of Gods!\" she whispered, \"flee,From Gautam save thyself and me.\"Trembling with doubt and wild with dreadLord Indra from the cottage fled;But fleeing in the grove he metThe home-returning anchoret,Whose wrath the Gods and fiends would shun,Such power his fervent rites had won.Fresh from the lustral flood he came,In splendour like the burning flame,With fuel for his sacred rites,And grass, the best of eremites.The Lord of Gods was sad of cheerTo see the mighty saint so near,And when the holy hermit spiedIn hermit garb the Thousand-eyed,He knew the whole, his fury brokeForth on the sinner as he spoke:\"Because my form thou hast assumed,And wrought this folly, thou art doomed,For this my curse to thee shall cling,Henceforth a sad and sexless thing.\"No empty threat that sentence came,It chilled his soul and marred his frame,His might and godlike vigour fled,And every nerve was cold and dead.Then on his wife his fury burst,And thus the guilty dame he cursed:\"For countless years, disloyal spouse,Devoted to severest vows,Thy bed the ashes, air thy food,Here shalt thou live in solitude.This lonely grove thy home shall be,And not an eye thy form shall see.When Ráma, Dasaratha child,Shall seek these shades then drear and wild,His coming shall remove thy stain,And make the sinner pure again.Due honour paid to him, thy guest,Shall cleanse thy fond and erring breast,Thee to my side in bliss restore,And give thy proper shape once more.\"(218)Thus to his guilty wife he said,Then far the holy Gautam fled,And on Himálaya lovely heightsSpent the long years in sternest rites.\"Canto XLIX. Ahalyá Freed.Then Ráma, following still his guide,Within the grove, with Lakshman, hied,Her vows a wondrous light had lentTo that illustrious penitent.He saw the glorious lady, screenedFrom eye of man, and God, and fiend,Like some bright portent which the careOf Brahmá launches through the air,Designed by his illusive artTo flash a moment and depart:Or like the flame that leaps on highTo sink involved in smoke and die:Or like the full moon shining throughThe wintry mist, then lost to view:Or like the sun reflection, castUpon the flood, too bright to last:So was the glorious dame till thenRemoved from Gods\\' and mortals\\' ken,Till--such was Gautam high decree--Prince Ráma came to set her free.Then, with great joy that dame to meet,The sons of Raghu clapped her feet;And she, remembering Gautam oath,With gentle grace received them both;Then water for their feet she gave,Guest-gift, and all that strangers crave.The prince, of courteous rule aware,Received, as meet, the lady care.Then flowers came down in copious rain,And moving to the heavenly strainOf music in the skies that rang,The nymphs and minstrels danced and sang:And all the Gods with one glad voicePraised the great dame, and cried, \"Rejoice!Through fervid rites no more defiled,But with thy husband reconciled.\"Gautam, the holy hermit knew--For naught escaped his godlike view--That Ráma lodged beneath that shade,And hasting there his homage paid.He took Ahalyá to his side,From sin and folly purified,And let his new-found consort bearIn his austerities a share.Then Ráma, pride of Raghu race,Welcomed by Gautam, face to face,Who every highest honour showed,To Mithilá pursued his road.Canto L. Janak.The sons of Raghu journeyed forth,Bending their steps \\'twixt east and north.Soon, guided by the sage, they found,Enclosed, a sacrificial ground.Then to the best of saints, his guide,In admiration Ráma cried:\"The high-souled king no toil has spared,But nobly for his rite prepared,How many thousand Bráhmans here,From every region, far and near,Well read in holy lore, appear!How many tents, that sages screen,With wains in hundreds, here are seen!Great Bráhman, let us find a placeWhere we may stay and rest a space.\"The hermit did as Ráma prayed,And in a spot his lodging made,Far from the crowd, sequestered, clear,With copious water flowing near.Then Janak, best of kings, awareOf Visvámitra lodging there,With Satánanda for his guide--The priest on whom he most relied,His chaplain void of guile and stain--And others of his priestly train,Bearing the gift that greets the guest,To meet him with all honour pressed.The saint received with gladsome mindEach honour and observance kind:Then of his health he asked the king,And how his rites were prospering,Janak, with chaplain and with priest,Addressed the hermits, chief and least,Accosting all, in due degree,With proper words of courtesy.Then, with his palms together laid,The king his supplication made:\"Deign, reverend lord, to sit thee downWith these good saints of high renown.\"Then sate the chief of hermits there,Obedient to the monarch prayer.Chaplain and priest, and king and peer,Sate in their order, far or near.Then thus the king began to say:\"The Gods have blest my rite to-day,And with the sight of thee repaidThe preparations I have made.Grateful am I, so highly blest,That thou, of saints the holiest,Hast come, O Bráhman, here with allThese hermits to the festival.Twelve days, O Bráhman Sage, remain--For so the learned priests ordain--And then, O heir of Kusik name,The Gods will come their dues to claim.\"With looks that testified delightThus spake he to the anchorite,Then with his suppliant hands upraised,He asked, as earnestly he gazed:\"These princely youths, O Sage, who vieIn might with children of the sky,Heroic, born for happy fate,With elephants\\' or lions\\' gait,Bold as the tiger and the bull,With lotus eyes so large and full,Armed with the quiver, sword and bow,Whose figures like the Asvins show,Like children of the heavenly Powers,Come freely to these shades of ours,--How have they reached on foot this place?What do they seek, and what their race?As sun and moon adorn the sky,This spot the heroes glorify:Alike in stature, port, and mien,The same fair form in each is seen.\"(219)Thus spoke the monarch, lofty-souled,The saint, of heart unfathomed, toldHow, sons of Dasaratha, theyAccompanied his homeward way,How in the hermitage they dwelt,And slaughter to the demons dealt:Their journey till the spot they nearedWhence fair Visálá towers appeared:Ahalyá seen and freed from taint;Their meeting with her lord the saint;And how they thither came, to knowThe virtue of the famous bow.Thus Visvámitra spoke the wholeTo royal Janak, great of soul,And when this wondrous tale was o\\'er,The glorious hermit said no more.Canto LI. Visvámitra.Wise Visvámitra tale was done:Then sainted Gautam eldest son,Great Satánanda, far-renowned,Whom long austerities had crownedWith glory--as the news he heardThe down upon his body stirred,--Filled full of wonder at the sightOf Ráma, felt supreme delight.When Satánanda saw the pairOf youthful princes seated there,He turned him to the holy manWho sate at ease, and thus began:\"And didst thou, mighty Sage, in truthShow clearly to this royal youthMy mother, glorious far and wide,Whom penance-rites have sanctified?And did my glorious mother--she,Heiress of noble destiny--Serve her great guest with woodland store,Whom all should honour evermore?Didst thou the tale to Ráma tellOf what in ancient days befell,The sin, the misery, and the shameOf guilty God and faithless dame?And, O thou best of hermits, say,Did Ráma healing presence stayHer trial? was the wife restoredAgain to him, my sire and lord?Say, Hermit, did that sire of mineReceive her with a soul benign,When long austerities in timeHad cleansed her from the taint of crime?And, son of Kusik, let me know,Did my great-minded father showHonour to Ráma, and regard,Before he journeyed hitherward?\"The hermit with attentive earMarked all the questions of the seer:To him for eloquence far-famed,His eloquent reply he framed:\"Yea, \\'twas my care no task to shun,And all I had to do was done;As Renuká and Bhrigu child,The saint and dame were reconciled.\"When the great sage had thus replied,To Ráma Satánanda cried:\"A welcome visit, Prince, is thine,Thou scion of King Raghu line.With him to guide thy way aright,This sage invincible in might,This Bráhman sage, most glorious-bright,By long austerities has wroughtA wondrous deed, exceeding thought:Thou knowest well, O strong of arm,This sure defence from scathe and harm.None, Ráma, none is living nowIn all the earth more blest than thou,That thou hast won a saint so triedIn fervid rites thy life to guide.Now listen, Prince, while I relateHis lofty deeds and wondrous fate.He was a monarch pious-souled.His foemen in the dust he rolled;Most learned, prompt at duty claim,His people good his joy and aim.Of old the Lord of Life gave birthTo mighty Kusa, king of earth.His son was Kusanábha, strong,Friend of the right, the foe of wrong.Gádhi, whose fame no time shall dim,Heir of his throne was born to him,And Visvámitra, Gádhi heir,Governed the land with kingly care.While years unnumbered rolled awayThe monarch reigned with equal sway.At length, assembling many a band,He led his warriors round the land--Complete in tale, a mighty force,Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse.Through cities, groves, and floods he passed,O\\'er lofty hills, through regions vast.He reached Vasishtha pure abode,Where trees, and flowers, and creepers glowed,Where troops of sylvan creatures fed;Which saints and angels visited.Gods, fauns, and bards of heavenly race,And spirits, glorified the place;The deer their timid ways forgot,And holy Bráhmans thronged the spot.Bright in their souls, like fire, were these,Made pure by long austerities,Bound by the rule of vows severe,And each in glory Brahmá peer.Some fed on water, some on air,Some on the leaves that withered there.Roots and wild fruit were others\\' food;All rage was checked, each sense subdued,There Bálakhilyas(220) went and came,Now breathed the prayer, now fed the flame:These, and ascetic bands beside,The sweet retirement beautified.Such was Vasishtha blest retreat,Like Brahmá own celestial seat,Which gladdened Visvámitra eyes,Peerless for warlike enterprise.Canto LII. Vasishtha Feast.Right glad was Visvámitra whenHe saw the prince of saintly men.Low at his feet the hero bent,And did obeisance, reverent.The king was welcomed in, and shownA seat beside the hermit own,Who offered him, when resting there,Fruit in due course, and woodland fare.And Visvámitra, noblest king,Received Vasishtha welcoming,Turned to his host, and prayed him tellThat he and all with him were well.Vasishtha to the king repliedThat all was well on every side,That fire, and vows, and pupils throve,And all the trees within the grove.And then the son of Brahmá, bestOf all who pray with voice suppressed,Questioned with pleasant words like theseThe mighty king who sate at ease:\"And is it well with thee? I pray;And dost thou win by virtuous swayThy people love, discharging allThe duties on a king that fall?Are all thy servants fostered well?Do all obey, and none rebel?Hast thou, destroyer of the foe,No enemies to overthrow?Does fortune, conqueror! still attendThy treasure, host, and every friend?Is it all well? Does happy fateOn sons and children children wait?\"He spoke. The modest king repliedThat all was prosperous far and wide.Thus for awhile the two conversed,As each to each his tale rehearsed,And as the happy moments flew,Their joy and friendship stronger grew.When such discourse had reached an end,Thus spoke the saint most reverendTo royal Visvámitra, whileHis features brightened with a smile:\"O mighty lord of men. I fainWould banquet thee and all thy trainIn mode that suits thy station high:And do not thou my prayer deny.Let my good lord with favour takeThe offering that I fain would make,And let me honour, ere we part,My royal guest with loving heart.\"Him Visvámitra thus addressed:\"Why make, O Saint, this new request?Thy welcome and each gracious wordSufficient honour have conferred.Thou gavest roots and fruit to eat,The treasures of this pure retreat,And water for my mouth and feet;And--boon I prize above the rest--Thy presence has mine eyesight blest.Honoured by thee in every way,To whom all honour all should pay,I now will go. My lord, Good-bye!Regard me with a friendly eye.\"Him speaking thus Vasishtha stayed,And still to share his banquet prayed.The will of Gádhi son he bent,And won the monarch to consent,Who spoke in answer. \"Let it be,Great Hermit, as it pleases thee.\"When, best of those who breathe the prayer,He heard the king his will declare,He called the cow of spotted skin,All spot without, all pure within.\"Come, Dapple-skin,\" he cried, \"with speed;Hear thou my words and help at need.My heart is set to entertainThis monarch and his mighty trainWith sumptuous meal and worthy fare;Be thine the banquet to prepare.Each dainty cate, each goodly dish,Of six-fold taste(221) as each may wish--All these, O cow of heavenly power,Rain down for me in copious shower:Viands and drink for tooth and lip,To eat, to suck, to quaff, to sip--Of these sufficient, and to spare,O plenty-giving cow, prepare.\"Canto LIII. Visvámitra Request.Thus charged, O slayer of thy foes,The cow from whom all plenty flows,Obedient to her saintly lord,Viands to suit each taste, outpoured.Honey she gave, and roasted grain,Mead sweet with flowers, and sugar-cane.Each beverage of flavour rare,An food of every sort, were there:Hills of hot rice, and sweetened cakes,And curdled milk and soup in lakes.Vast beakers foaming to the brimWith sugared drink prepared for him,And dainty sweetmeats, deftly made,Before the hermit guests were laid.So well regaled, so nobly fed,The mighty army banqueted,And all the train, from chief to least,Delighted in Vasishtha feast.Then Visvámitra, royal sage,Surrounded by his vassalage,Prince, peer, and counsellor, and allFrom highest lord to lowest thrall,Thus feasted, to Vasishtha criedWith joy, supremely gratified:\"Rich honour I, thus entertained,Most honourable lord, have gained:Now hear, before I journey hence,My words, O skilled in eloquence.Bought for a hundred thousand kine,Let Dapple-skin, O Saint, be mine.A wondrous jewel is thy cow,And gems are for the monarch brow.(222)To me her rightful lord resignThis Dapple-skin thou callest thine.\"The great Vasishtha, thus addressed,Arch-hermit of the holy breast,To Visvámitra answer made,The king whom all the land obeyed:\"Not for a hundred thousand,--nay,Not if ten million thou wouldst pay,With silver heaps the price to swell,--Will I my cow, O Monarch, sell.Unmeet for her is such a fate.That I my friend should alienate.As glory with the virtuous, sheFor ever makes her home with me.On her mine offerings which ascendTo Gods and spirits all depend:My very life is due to her,My guardian, friend, and minister.The feeding of the sacred flame,(223)The dole which living creatures claim.(224)The mighty sacrifice by fire,Each formula the rites require,(225)And various saving lore beside,Are by her aid, in sooth, supplied.The banquet which thy host has shared,Believe it, was by her prepared,In her mine only treasures lie,She cheers mine heart and charms mine eye.And reasons more could I assignWhy Dapple-skin can ne\\'er be thine.\"The royal sage, his suit denied,With eloquence more earnest cried:\"Tusked elephants, a goodly train,Each with a golden girth and chain,Whose goads with gold well fashioned shine--Of these be twice seven thousand thine.And four-horse cars with gold made bright,With steeds most beautifully white,Whose bells make music as they go,Eight hundred, Saint, will I bestow.Eleven thousand mettled steedsFrom famous lands, of noble breeds--These will I gladly give, O thouDevoted to each holy vow.Ten million heifers, fair to view,Whose sides are marked with every hue--These in exchange will I assign;But let thy Dapple-skin be mine.Ask what thou wilt, and piles untoldOf priceless gems and gleaming gold,O best of Bráhmans, shall be thine;But let thy Dapple-skin be mine.\"The great Vasishtha, thus addressed,Made answer to the king request:\"Ne\\'er will I give my cow away,My gem, my wealth, my life and stay.My worship at the moon first show,And at the full, to her I owe;And sacrifices small and great,Which largess due and gifts await.From her alone, their root, O King,My rites and holy service spring.What boots it further words to say?I will not give my cow awayWho yields me what I ask each day.\"Canto LIV. The Battle.As Saint Vasishtha answered so,Nor let the cow of plenty go,The monarch, as a last resource,Began to drag her off by force.While the king servants tore awayTheir moaning, miserable prey,Sad, sick at heart, and sore distressed,She pondered thus within her breast:\"Why am I thus forsaken? whyBetrayed by him of soul most high.Vasishtha, ravished by the handsOf soldiers of the monarch bands?Ah me! what evil have I doneAgainst the lofty-minded one,That he, so pious, can exposeThe innocent whose love he knows?\"In her sad breast as thus she thought,And heaved deep sighs with anguish fraught,With wondrous speed away she fled,And back to Saint Vasishtha sped.She hurled by hundreds to the groundThe menial crew that hemmed her round,And flying swifter than the blastBefore the saint herself she cast.There Dapple-skin before the saintStood moaning forth her sad complaint,And wept and lowed: such tones as comeFrom wandering cloud or distant drum.\"O son of Brahmá,\" thus cried she,\"Why hast thou thus forsaken me,That the king men, before thy face,Bear off thy servant from her place?\"Then thus the Bráhman saint repliedTo her whose heart with woe was tried,And grieving for his favourite sake,As to a suffering sister spake:\"I leave thee not: dismiss the thought;Nor, duteous, hast thou failed in aught.This king, o\\'erweening in the prideOf power, has reft thee from my side.Little, I ween, my strength could do\\'Gainst him, a mighty warrior too.Strong, as a soldier born and bred,--Great, as a king whom regions dread.See! what a host the conqueror leads,With elephants, and cars, and steeds.O\\'er countless bands his pennons fly;So is he mightier far than I.\"He spoke. Then she, in lowly mood,To that high saint her speech renewed:\"So judge not they who wisest are:The Bráhman might is mightier far.For Bráhmans strength from Heaven derive,And warriors bow when Bráhmans strive.A boundless power \\'tis thine to wield:To such a king thou shouldst not yield,Who, very mighty though he be,--So fierce thy strength,--must bow to thee.Command me, Saint. Thy power divineHas brought me here and made me thine;And I, howe\\'er the tyrant boast,Will tame his pride and slay his host.\"Then cried the glorious sage: \"CreateA mighty force the foe to mate.\"She lowed, and quickened into life,Pahlavas,(226) burning for the strife,King Visvámitra army slewBefore the very leader view.The monarch in excessive ire,His eyes with fury darting fire,Rained every missile on the foeTill all the Pahlavas were low.She, seeing all her champions slain,Lying by thousands on the plain.Created, by her mere desire,Yavans and Sakas, fierce and dire.And all the ground was overspreadWith Yavans and with Sakas dread:A host of warriors bright and strong,And numberless in closest throng:The threads within the lotus stem,So densely packed, might equal them.In gold-hued mail \\'against war attacks,Each bore a sword and battle-axe,The royal host, where\\'er these came,Fell as if burnt with ravening flame.The monarch, famous through the worldAgain his fearful weapons hurled,That made Kámbojas,(227) Barbars,(228) all,With Yavans, troubled, flee and fall.Canto LV. The Hermitage Burnt.So o\\'er the field that host lay strown,By Visvámitra darts o\\'erthrown.Then thus Vasishtha charged the cow:\"Create with all thy vigour now.\"Forth sprang Kámbojas, as she lowed;Bright as the sun their faces glowed,Forth from her udder Barbars poured,--Soldiers who brandished spear and sword,--And Yavans with their shafts and darts,And Sakas from her hinder parts.And every pore upon her fell,And every hair-producing cell,With Mlechchhas(229) and Kirátas(230) teemed,And forth with them Hárítas streamed.And Visvámitra mighty force,Car, elephant, and foot, and horse,Fell in a moment time, subduedBy that tremendous multitude.The monarch hundred sons, whose eyesBeheld the rout in wild surprise,Armed with all weapons, mad with rage,Rushed fiercely on the holy sage.One cry he raised, one glance he shot,And all fell scorched upon the spot:Burnt by the sage to ashes, theyWith horse, and foot, and chariot, lay.The monarch mourned, with shame and pain,His army lost, his children slain,Like Ocean when his roar is hushed,Or some great snake whose fangs are crushed:Or as in swift eclipse the SunDark with the doom he cannot shun:Or a poor bird with mangled wing--So, reft of sons and host, the kingNo longer, by ambition fired,The pride of war his breast inspired.He gave his empire to his son--Of all he had, the only one:And bade him rule as kings are taughtThen straight a hermit-grove he sought.Far to Himálaya side he fled,Which bards and Nágas visited,And, Mahádeva(231) grace to earn,He gave his life to penance stern.A lengthened season thus passed by,When Siva self, the Lord most High,Whose banner shows the pictured bull,(232)Appeared, the God most bountiful:\"Why fervent thus in toil and pain?What brings thee here? what boon to gain?Thy heart desire, O Monarch, speak:I grant the boons which mortals seek.\"The king, his adoration paid,To Mahádeva answer made:\"If thou hast deemed me fit to winThy favour, O thou void of sin,On me, O mighty God, bestowThe wondrous science of the bow,All mine, complete in every part,With secret spell and mystic art.To me be all the arms revealedThat Gods, and saints, and Titans wield,And every dart that arms the handsOf spirits, fiends and minstrel bands,Be mine, O Lord supreme in place,This token of thy boundless grace.\"The Lord of Gods then gave consent,And to his heavenly mansion went.Triumphant in the arms he held,The monarch breast with glory swelled.So swells the ocean, when uponHis breast the full moon beams have shone.Already in his mind he viewedVasishtha at his feet subdued.He sought that hermit grove, and thereLaunched his dire weapons through the air,Till scorched by might that none could stayThe hermitage in ashes lay.Where\\'er the inmates saw, aghast,The dart that Visvámitra cast,To every side they turned and fledIn hundreds forth disquieted.Vasishtha pupils caught the fear,And every bird and every deer,And fled in wild confusion forthEastward and westward, south and north,And so Vasishtha holy shadeA solitary wild was made,Silent awhile, for not a soundDisturbed the hush that was around.Vasishtha then, with eager cry,Called, \"Fear not, friends, nor seek to fly.This son of Gádhi dies to-day,Like hoar-frost in the morning ray.\"Thus having said, the glorious sageSpoke to the king in words of rage:\"Because thou hast destroyed this groveWhich long in holy quiet throve,By folly urged to senseless crime,Now shalt thou die before thy time.\"Canto LVI. Visvámitra Vow.But Visvámitra, at the threatOf that illustrious anchoret,Cried, as he launched with ready handA fiery weapon, \"Stand, O Stand!\"Vasishtha, wild with rage and hate,Raising, as \\'twere the Rod of Fate,His mighty Bráhman wand on high,To Visvámitra made reply:\"Nay, stand, O Warrior thou, and showWhat soldier can, \\'gainst Bráhman foe.O Gádhi son, thy days are told;Thy pride is tamed, thy dart is cold.How shall a warrior puissance dareWith Bráhman awful strength compare?To-day, base Warrior, shall thou feelThat God-sent might is more than steel.\"He raised his Bráhman staff, nor missedThe fiery dart that near him hissed:And quenched the fearful weapon fell,As flame beneath the billow swell.Then Gádhi son in fury threwLord Varun arm and Rudra too:Indra fierce bolt that all destroys;That which the Lord of Herds employs:The Human, that which minstrels keep,The deadly Lure, the endless Sleep:The Yawner, and the dart which charms;Lament and Torture, fearful arms:The Terrible, the dart which dries,The Thunderbolt which quenchless flies,And Fate dread net, and Brahmá noose,And that which waits for Varun use:The dart he loves who wields the bowPináka, and twin bolts that glowWith fury as they flash and fly,The quenchless Liquid and the Dry:The dart of Vengeance, swift to kill:The Goblins\\' dart, the Curlew Bill:The discus both of Fate and Right,And Vishnu, of unerring flight:The Wind-God dart, the Troubler dread,The weapon named the Horse Head.From his fierce hand two spears were thrown,And the great mace that smashes bone;The dart of spirits of the air,And that which Fate exults to bear:The Trident dart which slaughters foes,And that which hanging skulls compose:(233)These fearful darts in fiery rainHe hurled upon the saint amain,An awful miracle to view.But as the ceaseless tempest flew,The sage with wand of God-sent powerStill swallowed up that fiery shower.Then Gádhi son, when these had failed,With Brahmá dart his foe assailed.The Gods, with Indra at their head,And Nágas, quailed disquieted,And saints and minstrels, when they sawThe king that awful weapon draw;And the three worlds were filled with dread,And trembled as the missile sped.The saint, with Bráhman wand, empoweredBy lore divine that dart devoured.Nor could the triple world withdrawRapt gazes from that sight of awe;For as he swallowed down the dartOf Brahmá, sparks from every part,From finest pore and hair-cell, brokeEnveloped in a veil of smoke.The staff he waved was all aglowLike Yáma sceptre, King below,Or like the lurid fire of FateWhose rage the worlds will desolate.The hermits, whom that sight had awed,Extolled the saint, with hymn and laud:\"Thy power, O Sage, is ne\\'er in vain:Now with thy might thy might restrain.Be gracious, Master, and allowThe worlds to rest from trouble now;For Visvámitra, strong and dread,By thee has been discomfited.\"Then, thus addressed, the saint, well pleased,The fury of his wrath appeased.The king, o\\'erpowered and ashamed,With many a deep-drawn sigh exclaimed:\"Ah! Warriors\\' strength is poor and slight;A Bráhman power is truly might.This Bráhman staff the hermit heldThe fury of my darts has quelled.This truth within my heart impressed,With senses ruled and tranquil breastMy task austere will I begin,And Bráhmanhood will strive to win.\"Canto LVII. Trisanku.Then with his heart consumed with woe,Still brooding on his overthrowBy the great saint he had defied,At every breath the monarch sighed.Forth from his home his queen he led,And to a land far southward fled.There, fruit and roots his only food,He practised penance, sense-subdued,And in that solitary spotFour virtuous sons the king begot:Havishyand, from the offering named,And Madhushyand, for sweetness famed,Mahárath, chariot-borne in fight,And Dridhanetra strong of sight.A thousand years had passed away,When Brahmá, Sire whom all obey,Addressed in pleasant words like theseHim rich in long austerities:\"Thou by the penance, Kusik son,A place \\'mid royal saints hast won.Pleased with thy constant penance, weThis lofty rank assign to thee.\"Thus spoke the glorious Lord most HighFather of earth and air and sky,And with the Gods around him spreadHome to his changeless sphere he sped.But Visvámitra scorned the grace,And bent in shame his angry face.Burning with rage, o\\'erwhelmed with grief,Thus in his heart exclaimed the chief:\"No fruit, I ween, have I securedBy strictest penance long endured,If Gods and all the saints decreeTo make but royal saint of me.\"Thus pondering, he with sense subdued,With sternest zeal his vows renewed.Then reigned a monarch, true of soul,Who kept each sense in firm control;Of old Ikshváku line he came,That glories in Trisanku(234) name.Within his breast, O Raghu child,Arose a longing, strong and wild,Great offerings to the Gods to pay,And win, alive, to heaven his way.His priest Vasishtha aid he sought,And told him of his secret thought.But wise Vasishtha showed the hopeWas far beyond the monarch scope.Trisanku then, his suit denied,Far to the southern region hied,To beg Vasishtha sons to aidThe mighty plan his soul had made.There King Trisanku, far renowned,Vasishtha hundred children found,Each on his fervent vows intent,For mind and fame preëminent.To these the famous king applied,Wise children of his holy guide.Saluting each in order due.His eyes, for shame, he downward threw,And reverent hands together pressed,The glorious company addressed:\"I as a humble suppliant seekSuccour of you who aid the weak.A mighty offering I would pay,But sage Vasishtha answered, Nay.Be yours permission to accord,And to my rites your help afford.Sons of my guide, to each of youWith lowly reverence here I sue;To each, intent on penance-vow,O Bráhmans, low my head I bow,And pray you each with ready heartIn my great rite to bear a part,That in the body I may riseAnd dwell with Gods within the skies.Sons of my guide, none else I seeCan give what he refuses me.Ikshváku children still dependUpon their guide most reverend;And you, as nearest in degreeTo him, my deities shall be!\"Canto LVIII. Trisanku Cursed.Trisanku speech the hundred heard,And thus replied, to anger stirred:\"Why foolish King, by him denied,Whose truthful lips have never lied,Dost thou transgress his prudent rule,And seek, for aid, another school?(235)Ikshváku sons have aye reliedMost surely on their holy guide:Then how dost thou, fond Monarch, dareTransgress the rule his lips declare?\"Thy wish is vain,\" the saint replied,And bade thee cast the plan aside.Then how can we, his sons, pretendIn such a rite our aid to lend?O Monarch, of the childish heart,Home to thy royal town depart.That mighty saint, thy priest and guide,At noblest rites may well preside:The worlds for sacrifice combinedA worthier priest could never find.\"Such speech of theirs the monarch heard,Though rage distorted every word,And to the hermits made reply:\"You, like your sire, my suit deny.For other aid I turn from you:So, rich in penance, Saints, adieu!\"Vasishtha children heard, and guessedHis evil purpose scarce expressed,And cried, while rage their bosoms burned,\"Be to a vile Chandála(236) turned!\"This said, with lofty thoughts inspired,Each to his own retreat retired.That night Trisanku underwentSad change in shape and lineament.Next morn, an outcast swart of hue,His dusky cloth he round him drew.His hair had fallen from his head,And roughness o\\'er his skin was spread.Such wreaths adorned him as are foundTo flourish on the funeral ground.Each armlet was an iron ring:Such was the figure of the king,That every counsellor and peer,And following townsman, fled in fear.Alone, unyielding to dismay,Though burnt by anguish night and day,Great Visvámitra side he sought,Whose treasures were by penance bought.The hermit with his tender eyesLooked on Trisanku altered guise,And grieving at his ruined stateAddressed him thus, compassionate:\"Great King,\" the pious hermit said,\"What cause thy steps has hither led,Ayodhyá mighty Sovereign, whomA curse has plagued with outcast doom?\"In vile Chandála(237) shape, the kingHeard Visvámitra questioning,And, suppliant palm to palm applied,With answering eloquence he cried:\"My priest and all his sons refusedTo aid the plan on which I mused.Failing to win the boon I sought,To this condition I was brought.I, in the body, Saint, would fainA mansion in the skies obtain.I planned a hundred rites for this,But still was doomed the fruit to miss.Pure are my lips from falsehood stain,And pure they ever shall remain,--Yea, by a Warrior faith I swear,--Though I be tried with grief and care.Unnumbered rites to Heaven I paid,With righteous care the sceptre swayed;And holy priest and high-souled guideMy modest conduct gratified.But, O thou best of hermits, theyOppose my wish these rites to pay;They one and all refuse consent,Nor aid me in my high intent.Fate is, I ween, the power supreme,Man effort but an idle dream,Fate whirls our plans, our all away;Fate is our only hope and stay;Now deign, O blessed Saint, to aidMe, even me by Fate betrayed,Who come, a suppliant, sore distressed,One grace, O Hermit, to request.No other hope or way I see:No other refuge waits for me.Oh, aid me in my fallen state,And human will shall conquer Fate.\"Canto LIX. The Sons Of Vasishtha.Then Kusik son, by pity warmed,Spoke sweetly to the king transformed:\"Hail! glory of Ikshváku line:I know how bright thy virtues shine.Dismiss thy fear, O noblest Chief,For I myself will bring relief.The holiest saints will I inviteTo celebrate thy purposed rite:So shall thy vow, O King, succeed,And from thy cares shalt thou be freed.Thou in the form which now thou hast,Transfigured by the curse they cast,--Yea, in the body, King, shalt flee,Transported, where thou fain wouldst be.O Lord of men, I ween that thouHast heaven within thy hand e\\'en now,For very wisely hast thou done,And refuge sought with Kusik son.\"Thus having said, the sage addressedHis sons, of men the holiest,And bade the prudent saints whate\\'erWas needed for the rite prepare.The pupils he was wont to teachHe summoned next, and spoke this speech:\"Go bid Vasishtha\\'a sons appear,And all the saints be gathered here.And what they one and all replyWhen summoned by this mandate high,To me with faithful care report,Omit no word and none distort.\"The pupils heard, and prompt obeyed,To every side their way they made.Then swift from every quarter spedThe sages in the Vedas read.Back to that saint the envoys came,Whose glory shone like burning flame,And told him in their faithful speechThe answer that they bore from each:\"Submissive to thy word, O Seer,The holy men are gathering here.By all was meet obedience shown:Mahodaya(238) refused alone.And now, O Chief of hermits, hearWhat answer, chilling us with fear,Vasishtha hundred sons returned,Thick-speaking as with rage they burned:\"How will the Gods and saints partakeThe offerings that the prince would make,And he a vile and outcast thing,His ministrant one born a king?Can we, great Bráhmans, eat his food,And think to win beatitude,By Visvámitra purified?\"Thus sire and sons in scorn replied,And as these bitter words they said,Wild fury made their eyeballs red.Their answer when the arch-hermit heard,His tranquil eyes with rage were blurred;Great fury in his bosom woke,And thus unto the youths he spoke:\"Me, blameless me they dare to blame,And disallow the righteous claimMy fierce austerities have earned:To ashes be the sinners turned.Caught in the noose of Fate shall theyTo Yáma kingdom sink to-day.Seven hundred times shall they be bornTo wear the clothes the dead have worn.Dregs of the dregs, too vile to hate,The flesh of dogs their maws shall sate.In hideous form, in loathsome weed,A sad existence each shall lead.Mahodaya too, the fool who fainMy stainless life would try to stain,Stained in the world with long disgraceShall sink into a fowler place.Rejoicing guiltless blood to spill,No pity through his breast shall thrill.Cursed by my wrath for many a day,His wretched life for sin shall pay.\"Thus, girt with hermit, saint, and priest,Great Visvámitra spoke--and ceased.Canto LX. Trisanku Ascension.So with ascetic might, in ire,He smote the children and the sire.Then Visvámitra, far-renowned,Addressed the saints who gathered round:\"See by my side Trisanku stand,Ikshváku son, of liberal hand.Most virtuous and gentle, heSeeks refuge in his woe with me.Now, holy men, with me unite,And order so his purposed riteThat in the body he may riseAnd win a mansion in the skies.\"They heard his speech with ready earAnd, every bosom filled with fearOf Visvámitra, wise and great,Spoke each to each in brief debate:\"The breast of Kusik son, we know,With furious wrath is quick to glow.Whate\\'er the words he wills to say,We must, be very sure, obey.Fierce is our lord as fire, and straightMay curse us all infuriate.So let us in these rites engage,As ordered by the holy sage.And with our best endeavour striveThat King Ikshváku son, alive,In body to the skies may goBy his great might who wills it so.\"Then was the rite begun with care:All requisites and means were there:And glorious Visvámitra lentHis willing aid as president.And all the sacred rites were doneBy rule and use, omitting none.By chaplain-priest, the hymns who knew,In decent form and order due.Some time in sacrifice had past,And Visvámitra made, at last,The solemn offering with the prayerThat all the Gods might come and share.But the Immortals, one and all,Refused to hear the hermit call.Then red with rage his eyeballs blazed:The sacred ladle high he raised,And cried to King Ikshváku son:\"Behold my power, by penance won:Now by the might my merits lend,Ikshváku child, to heaven ascend.In living frame the skies attain,Which mortals thus can scarcely gain.My vows austere, so long endured,Have, as I ween, some fruit assured.Upon its virtue, King, rely,And in thy body reach the sky.\"His speech had scarcely reached its close,When, as he stood, the sovereign rose,And mounted swiftly to the skiesBefore the wondering hermits\\' eyes.But Indra, when he saw the kingHis blissful regions entering,With all the army of the BlestThus cried unto the unbidden guest:\"With thy best speed, Trisanku, flee:Here is no home prepared for thee.By thy great master curse brought low,Go, falling headlong, earthward go.\"Thus by the Lord of Gods addressed,Trisanku fell from fancied rest,And screaming in his swift descent,\"O, save me, Hermit!\" down he went.And Visvámitra heard his cry,And marked him falling from the sky,And giving all his passion sway,Cried out in fury, \"Stay, O stay!\"By penance-power and holy lore,Like Him who framed the worlds of yore,Seven other saints he fixed on highTo star with light the southern sky.Girt with his sages forth he went,And southward in the firmamentNew wreathed stars prepared to setIn many a sparkling coronet.He threatened, blind with rage and hate,Another Indra to create,Or, from his throne the ruler hurled,All Indraless to leave the world.Yea, borne away by passion storm,The sage began new Gods to form.But then each Titan, God, and saint,Confused with terror, sick and faint,To high souled Visvámitra hied,And with soft words to soothe him tried:\"Lord of high destiny, this king,To whom his master curses cling,No heavenly home deserves to gain,Unpurified from curse and stain.\"The son of Kusik, undeterred,The pleading of the Immortals heard,And thus in haughty words expressedThe changeless purpose of his breast:\"Content ye, Gods: I soothly swareTrisanku to the skies to bearClothed in his body, nor can IMy promise cancel or deny.Embodied let the king ascendTo life in heaven that ne\\'er shall end.And let these new-made stars of mineFirm and secure for ever shine.Let these, my work, remain secureLong as the earth and heaven endure.This, all ye Gods, I crave: do youAllow the boon for which I sue.\"Then all the Gods their answer made:\"So be it, Saint, as thou hast prayed.Beyond the sun diurnal wayThy countless stars in heaven shall stay:And \\'mid them hung, as one divine,Head downward shall Trisanku shine;And all thy stars shall ever flingTheir rays attendant on the king.\"(239)The mighty saint, with glory crowned,With all the sages compassed round,Praised by the Gods, gave full assent,And Gods and sages homeward went.Canto LXI. Sunahsepha.Then Visvámitra, when the BlestHad sought their homes of heavenly rest,Thus, mighty Prince, his counsel laidBefore the dwellers of the shade:\"The southern land where now we areOffers this check our rites to bar:(240)To other regions let us speed,And ply our tasks from trouble freed.Now turn we to the distant west.To Pushkar(241) wood where hermits rest,And there to rites austere apply,For not a grove with that can vie.\"The saint, in glory light arrayed,In Pushkar wood his dwelling made,And living there on roots and fruitDid penance stern and resolute.The king who filled Ayodhyá throne,By Ambarísha name far known,At that same time, it chanced, beganA sacrificial rite to plan.But Indra took by force awayThe charger that the king would slay.The victim lost, the Bráhman spedTo Ambarísha side, and said:\"Gone is the steed, O King, and thisIs due to thee, in care remiss.Such heedless faults will kings destroyWho fail to guard what they enjoy.The flaw is desperate: we needThe charger, or a man to bleed.Quick! bring a man if not the horse,That so the rite may have its course.\"The glory of Ikshváku lineMade offer of a thousand kine,And sought to buy at lordly priceA victim for the sacrifice.To many a distant land he drove,To many a people, town, and grove,And holy shades where hermits rest,Pursuing still his eager quest.At length on Bhrigu sacred heightThe saint Richíka met his sightSitting beneath the holy boughs.His children near him, and his spouse.The mighty lord drew near, assayedTo win his grace, and reverence paid;And then the sainted king addressedThe Bráhman saint with this request:\"Bought with a hundred thousand kine,Give me, O Sage, a son of thineTo be a victim in the rite,And thanks the favour shall requite.For I have roamed all countries round,Nor sacrificial victim found.Then, gentle Hermit, deign to spareOne child amid the number there.\"Then to the monarch speech repliedThe hermit, penance-glorified:\"For countless kine, for hills of gold,Mine eldest son shall ne\\'er be sold.\"But, when she heard the saint reply,The children mother, standing nigh,Words such as these in answer saidTo Ambarísha, monarch dread:\"My lord, the saint, has spoken well:His eldest child he will not sell.And know, great Monarch, that aboveThe rest my youngest born I love.\\'Tis ever thus: the father joyIs centred in his eldest boy.The mother loves her darling bestWhom last she rocked upon her breast:My youngest I will ne\\'er forsake.\"As thus the sire and mother spake,Young Sunahsepha, of the threeThe midmost, cried unurged and free:\"My sire withholds his eldest son,My mother keeps her youngest one:Then take me with thee, King: I weenThe son is sold who comes between.\"The king with joy his home resought,And took the prize his kine had bought.He bade the youth his car ascend,And hastened back the rites to end.(242)Canto LXII. Ambarísha Sacrifice.As thus the king that youth conveyed,His weary steeds at length he stayedAt height of noon their rest to takeUpon the bank of Pushkar lake.There while the king enjoyed reposeThe captive Sunahsepha rose,And hasting to the water sideHis uncle Visvámitra spied,With many a hermit \\'neath the treesEngaged in stern austerities.Distracted with the toil and thirst,With woeful mien, away he burst,Swift to the hermit breast he flew,And weeping thus began to sue:\"No sire have I, no mother dear,No kith or kin my heart to cheer:As justice bids, O Hermit, deignTo save me from the threatened pain.O thou to whom the wretched flee,And find a saviour, Saint, in thee,Now let the king obtain his will,And me my length of days fulfil,That rites austere I too may share,May rise to heaven and rest me there.With tender soul and gentle browBe guardian of the orphan thou,And as a father pities, soPreserve me from my fear and woe.\"When Visvámitra, glorious saint,Had heard the boy heart-rending plaint.He soothed his grief, his tears he dried,Then called his sons to him, and cried:\"The time is come for you to showThe duty and the aid bestowFor which, regarding future life,A man gives children to his wife.This hermit son, whom here you seeA suppliant, refuge seeks with me.O sons, the friendless youth befriend,And, pleasing me, his life defend.For holy works you all have wrought,True to the virtuous life I taught.Go, and as victims doomed to bleed,Die, and Lord Agni hunger feed.So shall the rite completed end,This orphan gain a saving friend,Due offerings to the Gods be paid,And your own father voice obeyed.\"Then Madhushyand and all the restAnswered their sire with scorn and jest:\"What! aid to others\\' sons afford,And leave thine own to die, my lord!To us it seems a horrid deed,As \\'twere on one own flesh to feed.\"The hermit heard his sons\\' reply,And burning rage inflamed his eye.Then forth his words of fury burst:\"Audacious speech, by virtue cursed!It lifts on end each shuddering hair--My charge to scorn! my wrath to dare!You, like Vasishtha evil brood,Shall make the flesh of dogs your foodA thousand years in many a birth,And punished thus shall dwell on earth.\"Thus on his sons his curse he laid.Then calmed again that youth dismayed,And blessed him with his saving aid:\"When in the sacred fetters bound,And with a purple garland crowned,At Vishnu post thou standest tied,With lauds be Agni glorified.And these two hymns of holy praiseForget not, Hermit son, to raiseIn the king rite, and thou shalt beLord of thy wish, preserved, and free.\"He learnt the hymns with mind intent,And from the hermit presence went.To Ambarísha thus he spake:\"Let us our onward journey take.Haste to thy home, O King, nor stayThe lustral rites with slow delay.\"The boy address the monarch cheered,And soon the sacred ground he neared.The convocation high decreeDeclared the youth from blemish free;Clothed in red raiment he was tiedA victim at the pillar side.There bound, the Fire-God hymn he raised,And Indra and Upendra praised.Thousand-eyed Vishnu, pleased to hearThe mystic laud, inclined his ear,And won by worship, swift to save,Long life to Sunahsepha gave.The king in bounteous measure gainedThe fruit of sacrifice ordained,By grace of Him who rules the skies,Lord Indra of the thousand eyes.And Visvámitra evermore.Pursued his task on Pushkar shoreUntil a thousand years had pastIn fierce austerity and fast.Canto LXIII. Menaká.A thousand years had thus flown byWhen all the Gods within the sky,Eager that he the fruit might gainOf fervent rite and holy pain,Approached the great ascetic, nowBathed after toil and ended vow.Then Brahmá speaking for the restWith sweetest words the sage addressed:\"Hail, Saint! This high and holy nameThy rites have won, thy merits claim.\"Thus spoke the Lord whom Gods revere,And sought again his heavenly sphere.But Visvámitra, more intent,His mind to sterner penance bent.So many a season rolled away,When Menaká, fair nymph, one dayCame down from Paradise to laveHer perfect limbs in Pushkar wave,The glorious son of Kusik sawThat peerless shape without a flawFlash through the flood translucent shroudLike lightning gleaming through a cloud.He saw her in that lone retreat,Most beautiful from head to feet,And by Kandarpa(243) might subduedHe thus addressed her as he viewed:\"Welcome, sweet nymph! O deign, I pray,In these calm shades awhile to stay.To me some gracious favour show,For love has set my breast aglow.\"He spoke. The fairest of the fairMade for awhile her dwelling there,While day by day the wild delightStayed vow austere and fervent riteThere as the winsome charmer woveHer spells around him in the grove,And bound him in a golden chain,Five sweet years fled, and five again.Then Visvámitra woke to shame,And, fraught with anguish, memory cameFor quick he knew, with anger fired,That all the Immortals had conspiredTo lap his careless soul in ease,And mar his long austerities.\"Ten years have past, each day and nightUnheeded in delusive flight.So long my fervent rites were stayed,While thus I lay by love betrayed.\"As thus long sighs the hermit heaved,And, touched with deep repentance, grieved,He saw the fair one standing nighWith suppliant hands and trembling eye.With gentle words he bade her go,Then sought the northern hills of snow.With firm resolve he vowed to beatThe might of love beneath his feet.Still northward to the distant sideOf Kausikí(244), the hermit hide,And gave his life to penance thereWith rites austere most hard to bear.A thousand years went by, and stillHe laboured on the northern hillWith pains so terrible and drearThat all the Gods were chilled with fear,And Gods and saints, for swift advice,Met in the halls of Paradise.\"Let Kusik son,\" they counselled, \"beA Mighty saint by just decree.\"His ear to hear their counsel lentThe Sire of worlds, omnipotent.To him enriched by rites severeHe spoke in accents sweet to hear:\"Hail, Mighty Saint! dear son, all hail!Thy fervour wins, thy toils prevail.Won by thy vows and zeal intenseI give this high preëminence.\"He to the General Sire replied,Not sad, nor wholly satisfied:\"When thou, O Brahmá, shalt declareThe title, great beyond compare,Of Bráhman saint my worthy meed,Hard earned by many a holy deed,Then may I deem in sooth I holdEach sense of body well controlled.\"Then Brahmá cried, \"Not yet, not yet:Toil on awhile O Anchoret!\"Thus having said to heaven he went,The saint, upon his task intent,Began his labours to renew,Which sterner yet and fiercer grew.His arms upraised, without a rest,With but one foot the earth he pressed;The air his food, the hermit stoodStill as a pillar hewn from wood.Around him in the summer daysFive mighty fires combined to blaze.In floods of rain no veil was spreadSave clouds, to canopy his head.In the dank dews both night and dayCouched in the stream the hermit lay.Thus, till a thousand years had fled,He plied his task of penance dread.Then Vishnu and the Gods with aweThe labours of the hermit saw,And Sakra, in his troubled breast,Lord of the skies, his fear confessed.And brooded on a plan to spoilThe merits of the hermit toil.Encompassed by his Gods of StormHe summoned Rambhá, fair of form,And spoke a speech for woe and weal,The saint to mar, the God to heal.Canto LXIV. Rambhá.\"A great emprise, O lovely maid,To save the Gods, awaits thine aid:To bind the son of Kusik sure,And take his soul with love sweet lure.\"Thus order\\'d by the Thousand-eyedThe suppliant nymph in fear replied:\"O Lord of Gods, this mighty sageIs very fierce and swift to rage.I doubt not, he so dread and sternOn me his scorching wrath will turn.Of this, my lord, am I afraid:Have mercy on a timid maid.\"Her suppliant hands began to shake,When thus again Lord Indra spake:\"O Rambhá, drive thy fears away,And as I bid do thou obey.In Koďl form, who takes the heartWhen trees in spring to blossom start,I, with Kandarpa for my friend,Close to thy side mine aid will lend.Do thou thy beauteous splendour armWith every grace and winsome charm,And from his awful rites seduceThis Kusik son, the stern recluse.\"Lord Indra ceased. The nymph obeyed:In all her loveliest charms arrayed,With winning ways and witching smileShe sought the hermit to beguile.The sweet note of that tuneful birdThe saint with ravished bosom heard,And on his heart a rapture passedAs on the nymph a look he cast.But when he heard the bird prolongHis sweet incomparable song,And saw the nymph with winning smile,The hermit heart perceived the wile.And straight he knew the Thousand-eyedA plot against his peace had tried.Then Kusik son indignant laidHis curse upon the heavenly maid:\"Because thou wouldst my soul engageWho fight to conquer love and rage,Stand, till ten thousand years have flown,Ill-fated maid, transformed to stone.A Bráhman then, in glory strong,Mighty through penance stern and long,Shall free thee from thine altered shape;Thou from my curse shalt then escape.\"But when the saint had cursed her so,His breast was burnt with fires of woe,Grieved that long effort to restrainHis mighty wrath was all in vain.Cursed by the angry sage power,She stood in stone that selfsame hour.Kandarpa heard the words he said,And quickly from his presence fled.His fall beneath his passion swayHad reft the hermit meed away.Unconquered yet his secret foes,The humbled saint refused repose:\"No more shall rage my bosom till,Sealed be my lips, my tongue be still.My very breath henceforth I holdUntil a thousand years are told:Victorious o\\'er each erring sense,I\\'ll dry my frame with abstinence,Until by penance duly doneA Bráhman rank be bought and won.For countless years, as still as death,I taste no food, I draw no breath,And as I toil my frame shall standUnharmed by time destroying hand.\"Canto LXV. Visvámitra TriumphThen from Himálaya heights of snow,The glorious saint prepared to go,And dwelling in the distant eastHis penance and his toil increased.A thousand years his lips he heldClosed by a vow unparalleled,And other marvels passing thought,Unrivalled in the world, he wrought.In all the thousand years his frameDry as a log of wood became.By many a cross and check beset,Rage had not stormed his bosom yet.With iron will that naught could bendHe plied his labour till the end.So when the weary years were o\\'er,Freed from his vow so stern and sore,The hermit, all his penance sped,Sate down to eat his meal of bread.Then Indra, clad in Bráhman guise,Asked him for food with hungry eyes.The mighty saint, with steadfast soul,To the false Bráhman gave the whole,And when no scrap for him remained,Fasting and faint, from speech refrained.His silent vow he would not break:No breath he heaved, no word he spake,Then as he checked his breath, behold!Around his brow thick smoke-clouds rolledAnd the three worlds, as if o\\'erspreadWith ravening flames, were filled with dread.Then God and saint and bard, convened,And Nága lord, and snake, and fiend,Thus to the General Father cried,Distracted, sad, and terrified:\"Against the hermit, sore assailed,Lure, scathe, and scorn have naught availed,Proof against rage and treacherous artHe keeps his vow with constant heart.Now if his toils assist him naughtTo gain the boon his soul has sought,He through the worlds will ruin sendThat fixt and moving things shall end,The regions now are dark with doom,No friendly ray relieves the gloom.Each ocean foams with maddened tide,The shrinking hills in fear subside.Trembles the earth with feverous throeThe wind in fitful tempest blows.No cure we see with troubled eyes:And atheist brood on earth may rise.The triple world is wild with care,Or spiritless in dull despair.Before that saint the sun is dim,His blessed light eclipsed by him.Now ere the saint resolve to bringDestruction on each living thing,Let us appease, while yet we may,Him bright as fire, like fire to slay.Yea, as the fiery flood of FateLays all creation desolate,He o\\'er the conquered Gods may reign:O, grant him what he longs to gain.\"Then all the Blest, by Brahmá led,Approached the saint and sweetly said:\"Hail, Bráhman Saint! for such thy place:Thy vows austere have won our grace.A Bráhman rank thy penance sternAnd ceaseless labour richly earn.I with the Gods of Storm decreeLong life, O Bráhman Saint, to thee.May peace and joy thy soul possess:Go where thou wilt in happiness.\"Thus by the General Sire addressed,Joy and high triumph filled his breast.His head in adoration bowed,Thus spoke he to the Immortal crowd:\"If I, ye Gods, have gained at lastBoth length of days and Bráhman caste,Grant that the high mysterious name,And holy Vedas, own my claim,And that the formula to blessThe sacrifice, its lord confess.And let Vasishtha, who excelsIn Warriors\\' art and mystic spells,In love of God without a peer,Confirm the boon you promise here.\"With Brahmá son Vasishtha, bestOf those who pray with voice repressed,The Gods by earnest prayer prevailed,And thus his new-made friend he hailed:\"Thy title now is sure and goodTo rights of saintly Bráhmanhood.\"Thus spake the sage. The Gods, content,Back to their heavenly mansions went.And Visvámitra, pious-souled,Among the Bráhman saints enrolled,On reverend Vasishtha pressedThe honours due to holy guest.Successful in his high pursuit,The sage, in penance resolute,Walked in his pilgrim wanderings o\\'erThe whole broad land from shore to shore.\\'Twas thus the saint, O Raghu son,His rank among the Bráhmans won.Best of all hermits, Prince, is he;In him incarnate Penance see.Friend of the right, who shrinks from ill,Heroic powers attend him still.\"The Bráhman, versed in ancient lore,Thus closed his tale, and said no more,To Satánanda Kusik sonCried in delight, Well done! well done!Then Janak, at the tale amazed,Spoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:\"High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,And thanks I owe for bliss supreme,That thou and Raghu children tooHave come my sacrifice to view.To look on thee with blessed eyesExalts my soul and purifies.Yea, thus to see thee face to faceEnriches me with store of grace.Thy holy labours wrought of old,And mighty penance, fully told,Ráma and I with great delightHave heard, O glorious Anchorite.Unrivalled thine ascetic deeds:Thy might, O Saint, all might exceeds.No thought may scan, no limit boundThe virtues that in thee are found.The story of thy wondrous fateMy thirsty ears can never sate.The hour of evening rites is near:The sun declines in swift career.At early dawn, O Hermit, deignTo let me see thy face again.Best of ascetics, part in bliss:Do thou thy servant now dismiss.\"The saint approved, and glad and kindDismissed the king with joyful mindAround the sage King Janak wentWith priests and kinsmen reverent.Then Visvámitra, honoured so,By those high-minded, rose to go,And with the princes took his wayTo seek the lodging where they lay.Canto LXVI. Janak Speech.With cloudless lustre rose the sun;The king, his morning worship done,Ordered his heralds to inviteThe princes and the anchorite.With honour, as the laws decree,The monarch entertained the three.Then to the youths and saintly manVideha lord this speech began:\"O blameless Saint, most welcome thou!If I may please thee tell me how.Speak, mighty lord, whom all revere,\\'Tis thine to order, mine to hear.\"Thus he on mighty thoughts intent;Then thus the sage most eloquent:\"King Dasaratha sons, this pairOf warriors famous everywhere,Are come that best of bows to seeThat lies a treasure stored by thee.This, mighty Janak, deign to show,That they may look upon the bow,And then, contented, homeward go.\"Then royal Janak spoke in turn:\"O best of Saints, the story learnWhy this famed bow, a noble prize,A treasure in my palace lies.A monarch, Devarát by name,Who sixth from ancient Nimi came,Held it as ruler of the land,A pledge in his successive hand.This bow the mighty Rudra boreAt Daksha(245) sacrifice of yore,When carnage of the Immortals stainedThe rite that Daksha had ordained.Then as the Gods sore wounded fled,Victorious Rudra, mocking, said:\"Because, O Gods, ye gave me naughtWhen I my rightful portion sought,Your dearest parts I will not spare,But with my bow your frames will tear.\"The Sons of Heaven, in wild alarm,Soft flatteries tried his rage to charm.Then Bhava, Lord whom Gods adore,Grew kind and friendly as before,And every torn and mangled limbWas safe and sound restored by him.Thenceforth this bow, the gem of bows,That freed the God of Gods from foes,Stored by our great forefathers layA treasure and a pride for aye.Once, as it chanced, I ploughed the ground,When sudden, \\'neath the share was foundAn infant springing from the earth,Named Sítá from her secret birth.(246)In strength and grace the maiden grew,My cherished daughter, fair to view.I vowed her, of no mortal birth,Meet prize for noblest hero worth.In strength and grace the maiden grew,And many a monarch came to woo.To all the princely suitors IGave, mighty Saint, the same reply:\"I give not thus my daughter, shePrize of heroic worth shall be.(247)To Míthilá the suitors pressedTheir power and might to manifest.To all who came with hearts aglowI offered Siva wondrous bow.Not one of all the royal bandCould raise or take the bow in hand.The suitors\\' puny might I spurned,And back the feeble princes turned.Enraged thereat, the warriors met,With force combined my town beset.Stung to the heart with scorn and shame,With war and threats they madly came,Besieged my peaceful walls, and longTo Míthilá did grievous wrong.There, wasting all, a year they lay,And brought my treasures to decay,Filling my soul, O Hermit chief,With bitter woe and hopeless grief.At last by long-wrought penance IWon favour with the Gods on high,Who with my labours well contentA four-fold host to aid me sent.Then swift the baffled heroes fledTo all the winds discomfited--Wrong-doers, with their lords and host,And all their valour idle boast.This heavenly bow, exceeding bright,These youths shall see, O Anchorite.Then if young Ráma hand can stringThe bow that baffled lord and king,To him I give, as I have sworn,My Sítá, not of woman born.\"Canto LXVII. The Breaking Of The Bow.Then spoke again the great recluse:\"This mighty bow, O King, produce.\"King Janak, at the saint request,This order to his train addressed:\"Let the great bow be hither borne,Which flowery wreaths and scents adorn.\"Soon as the monarch words were said,His servants to the city sped,Five thousand youths in number, allOf manly strength and stature tall,The ponderous eight-wheeled chest that heldThe heavenly bow, with toil propelled.At length they brought that iron chest,And thus the godlike king addressed:\"This best of bows, O lord, we bring,Respected by each chief and king,And place it for these youths to see,If, Sovereign, such thy pleasure be.\"With suppliant palm to palm appliedKing Janak to the strangers cried:\"This gem of bows, O Bráhman Sage,Our race has prized from age to age,Too strong for those who yet have reigned,Though great in might each nerve they strained.Titan and fiend its strength defies,God, spirit, minstrel of the skies.And bard above and snake belowAre baffled by this glorious bow.Then how may human prowess hopeWith such a bow as this to cope?What man with valour choicest giftThis bow can draw, or string, or lift?Yet let the princes, holy Seer,Behold it: it is present here.\"Then spoke the hermit pious-souled:\"Ráma, dear son, the bow behold.\"Then Ráma at his word unclosedThe chest wherein its might reposed,Thus crying, as he viewed it: \"Lo!I lay mine hand upon the bow:May happy luck my hope attendIts heavenly strength to lift or bend.\"\"Good luck be thine,\" the hermit cried:\"Assay the task!\" the king replied.Then Raghu son, as if in sport,Before the thousands of the court,The weapon by the middle raisedThat all the crowd in wonder gazed.With steady arm the string he drewTill burst the mighty bow in two.As snapped the bow, an awful clang,Loud as the shriek of tempests, rang.The earth, affrighted, shook amainAs when a hill is rent in twain.Then, senseless at the fearful sound,The people fell upon the ground:None save the king, the princely pair,And the great saint, the shock could bear.When woke to sense the stricken train,And Janak soul was calm again,With suppliant hands and reverent head,These words, most eloquent, he said:\"O Saint, Prince Ráma stands alone:His peerless might he well has shown.A marvel has the hero wroughtBeyond belief, surpassing thought.My child, to royal Ráma wed,New glory on our line will shed:And true my promise will remainThat hero worth the bride should gain.Dearer to me than light and life,My Sítá shall be Ráma wife.If thou, O Bráhman, leave concede,My counsellors, with eager speed,Borne in their flying cars, to fairAyodhyá town the news shall bear,With courteous message to entreatThe king to grace my royal seat.This to the monarch shall they tell,The bride is his who won her well:And his two sons are resting hereProtected by the holy seer.So, at his pleasure, let them leadThe sovereign to my town with speed.\"The hermit to his prayer inclinedAnd Janak, lord of virtuous mind,With charges, to Ayodhyá sentHis ministers: and forth they went.Canto LXVIII. The Envoys\\' Speech.Three nights upon the road they passedTo rest the steeds that bore them fast,And reached Ayodhyá town at last.Then straight at Dasaratha callThey stood within the royal hall,Where, like a God, inspiring awe,The venerable king they saw.With suppliant palm to palm applied,And all their terror laid aside,They spoke to him upon the throneWith modest words, in gentle tone:\"Janak, Videha king, O Sire,Has sent us hither to inquireThe health of thee his friend most dear,Of all thy priests and every peer.Next Kusik son consenting, thusKing Janak speaks, dread liege, by us:\"I made a promise and decreeThat valour prize my child should be.Kings, worthless found in worth assay,With mien dejected turned away.Thy sons, by Visvámitra led,Unurged, my city visited,And peerless in their might have gainedMy daughter, as my vow ordained.Full in a vast assembly viewThy hero Ráma broke in twoThe gem of bows, of monstrous size,That came a treasure from the skies.Ordained the prize of hero might,Sítá my child is his by right.Fain would I keep my promise made,If thou, O King, approve and aid.Come to my town thy son to see:Bring holy guide and priest with thee.O lord of kings, my suit allow,And let me keep my promised vow.So joying for thy children sakeTheir triumph too shalt thou partake,With Visvámitra high consent.\"Such words with friendship eloquentSpoke Janak, fair Videha king,By Satánanda counselling.\"The envoys thus the king addressed,And mighty joy his heart possessed.To Vámadeva quick he cried,Vasishtha, and his lords beside:\"Lakshman, and he, my princely boyWho fills Kausalyá soul with joy,By Visvámitra guarded wellAmong the good Videhans dwell.Their ruler Janak, prompt to ownThe peerless might my child has shown,To him would knit in holy tiesHis daughter, valour lovely prize.If Janak plan seem good to you,Come, speed we to his city too,Nor let occasion idly by.\"He ceased. There came a glad replyFrom priest and mighty saint and allThe councillors who thronged the hall.Then cried the king with joyous heart:\"To-morrow let us all depart.\"That night the envoys entertainedWith honour and all care remained.Canto LXIX. Dasaratha Visit.Soon as the shades of night had fled,Thus to the wise Sumantra saidThe happy king, while priest and peer,Each in his place, were standing near:\"Let all my treasurers to-day,Set foremost in the long array,With gold and precious gems suppliedIn bounteous store, together ride.And send you out a mighty force,Foot, chariot, elephant, and horse.Besides, let many a car of state,And noblest steeds, my will await.Vasishtha, Vámadeva sage,And Márkandeya reverend age,Jáváli, Kasyap godlike seed,And wise Kátyáyana, shall lead.Thy care, Sumantra, let it beTo yoke a chariot now for me,That so we part without delay:These envoys hasten me away.\"So fared he forth. That host, with speed,Quadruple, as the king decreed,With priests to head the bright array,Followed the monarch on his way.Four days they travelled on the road,And eve Videha kingdom showed.Janak had left his royal seatThe venerable king to greet,And, noblest, with these words addressedThat noblest lord, his happy guest:\"Hail, best of kings: a blessed fateHas led thee, Monarch, to my state.Thy sons, supreme in high emprise,Will gladden now their father eyes.And high my fate, that hither leadsVasishtha, bright with holy deeds,Girt with these sages far-renowned,Like Indra with the Gods around.Joy! joy! for vanquished are my foes:Joy! for my house in glory grows,With Raghu noblest sons allied,Supreme in strength and valour pride.To-morrow with its early lightWill shine on my completed rite.Then, sanctioned by the saints and thee,The marriage of thy Ráma see.\"Then Dasaratha, best of thoseWhose speech in graceful order flows,With gathered saints on every side,Thus to the lord of earth replied:\"A truth is this I long have known,A favour is the giver own.What thou shalt bid, O good and true,We, as our power permits, will do.\"That answer of the truthful lord,With virtuous worth and honour stored,Janak, Videha noble king,Heard gladly, greatly marvelling.With bosoms filled with pleasure metLong-parted saint and anchoret,And linked in friendship tie they spentThe peaceful night in great content.Ráma and Lakshman thither sped,By sainted Visvámitra led,And bent in filial love to greetTheir father, and embraced his feet.The aged king, rejoiced to hearAnd see again his children dear,Honoured by Janak thoughtful care,With great enjoyment rested there.King Janak, with attentive heed,Consulted first his daughters\\' need,And ordered all to speed the rite;Then rested also for the night.Canto LXX. The Maidens Sought.Then with the morn returning sun.King Janak, when his rites were done,Skilled all the charms of speech to know,Spoke to wise Satánanda so:\"My brother, lord of glorious fame,My younger, Kusadhwaj by name,Whose virtuous life has won renown,Has settled in a lovely town,Sánkásyá, decked with grace divine,Whose glories bright as Pushpak shine,While Ikshumatí rolls her waveHer lofty rampart foot to lave.Him, holy priest, I long to see:The guardian of my rite is he:That my dear brother may not missA share of mine expected bliss.\"Thus in the presence of the priestThe royal Janak spoke, and ceased.Then came his henchmen, prompt and brave,To whom his charge the monarch gave.Soon as they heard his will, in hasteWith fleetest steeds away they raced,To lead with them that lord of kings,As Indra call Lord Vishnu brings.Sánkásyá walls they duly gained,And audience of the king obtained.To him they told the news they broughtOf marvels past and Janak thought.Soon as the king the story knewFrom those good envoys swift and true,To Janak wish he gave assent,And swift to Míthilá he went.He paid to Janak reverence due,And holy Satánanda too,Then sate him on a glorious seatFor kings or Gods celestial meet.Soon as the brothers, noble pairPeerless in might, were seated there,They gave the wise Sudáman, bestOf councillors, their high behest:\"Go, noble councillor,\" they cried,\"And hither to our presence guideIkshváku son, Ayodhyá lord,Invincible by foeman sword,With both his sons, each holy seer,And every minister and peer.\"Sudáman to the palace flew,And saw the mighty king who threwSplendour on Raghu splendid race,Then bowed his head with seemly grace:\"O King, whose hand Ayodhyá sways,My lord, whom Míthilá obeys,Yearns with desire, if thou agree,Thee with thy guide and priest to see.\"Soon as the councillor had ceased,The king, with saint and peer and priest,Sought, speeding through the palace gate,The hall where Janak held his state.There, with his nobles round him spread,Thus to Videha lord be said:\"Thou knowest, King, whose aid divineProtects Ikshváku royal line.In every need, whate\\'er befall,The saint Vasishtha speaks for all.If Visvámitra so allow,And all the saints around me now,The sage will speak, at my desire,As order and the truth require.\"Soon as the king his lips had stilled,Up rose Vasishtha, speaker skilled.And to Videha lord beganIn flowing words that holy man:\"From viewless Nature Brahmá rose,No change, no end, no waste he knows.A son had he Maríchi styled,And Kasyap was Maríchi child.From him Vivasvat sprang: from himManu whose fame shall ne\\'er be dim.Manu, who life to mortals gave,Begot Ikshváku good and brave.First of Ayodhyá kings was he,Pride of her famous dynasty.From him the glorious Kukshi sprang,Whose fame through all the regions rang.Rival of Kukshi ancient fame,His heir, the great Vikukshi, came,His son was Vána, lord of might;His Anaranya, strong to fight.His son was Prithu, glorious name;From him the good Trisanku came.He left a son renowned afar,Known by the name of Dhundhumár.His son, who drove the mighty car,Was Yuvanásva, feared in war.He passed away. Him followed thenHis son Mándhátá, king of men.His son was blest in high emprise,Susandhi, fortunate and wise.Two noble sons had he, to witDhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.Bharat was Dhruvasandhi son,And glorious fame that monarch won.The warrior Asit he begot.Asit had warfare, fierce and hot,With rival kings in many a spot,Haihayas, Tálajanghas styled,And Sasivindus, strong and wild.Long time he strove, but forced to yieldFled from his kingdom and the field.With his two wives away he fledWhere high Himálaya lifts his head,And, all his wealth and glory past,He paid the dues of Fate at last.The wives he left had both conceived--So is the ancient tale believed--One, of her rival hopes afraidFell poison in her viands laid.It chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu child,Had wandered to that pathless wild,And there Himálaya lovely heightDetained him with a strange delight.There came the other widowed queen,With lotus eyes and beauteous mien,Longing a noble son to bear,And wooed the saint with earnest prayer.When thus Kálindi,(248) fairest dame,With reverent supplication came,To her the holy sage replied:\"Born with the poison from thy side,O happy Queen, shall spring ere longAn infant fortunate and strong.Then weep no more, and check thy sighs,Sweet lady of the lotus eyes.\"The queen, who loved her perished lord,For meet reply, the saint adored,And, of her husband long bereaved,She bore a son by him conceived.Because her rival mixed the baneTo render her conception vain,And fruit unripened to destroy,Sagar(249) she called her darling boy.To Sagar Asamanj was heir:Bright Ansumán his consort bare.Ansumán son, Dilípa famed,Begot a son Bhagírath named.From him the great Kakutstha rose:From him came Raghu, feared by foes,Of him sprang Purushádak bold,Fierce hero of gigantic mould:Kalmáshapáda name he bore,Because his feet were spotted o\\'er.(250)From him came Sankan, and from himSudarsan, fair in face and limb.From beautiful Sudarsan camePrince Agnivarna, bright as flame.His son was Síghraga, for speedUnmatched; and Maru was his seed.Prasusruka was Maru child;His son was Ambarísha styled.Nahush was Ambarísha heir,The mighty lord of regions fair:Nahush begot Yayáti: he,Nábhág of happy destiny.Son of Nábhág was Aja: his,The glorious Dasaratha is,Whose noble children boast to beRáma and Lakshman, whom we see.Thus do those kings of purest raceTheir lineage from Ikshváku trace:Their hero lives the right maintained,Their lips with falsehood ne\\'er were stained.In Ráma and in Lakshman nameThy daughters as their wives I claim,So shall in equal bands be tiedEach peerless youth with peerless bride.\"Canto LXXI. Janak Pedigree.Then to the saint supremely wiseKing Janak spoke in suppliant guise:\"Deign, Hermit, with attentive ear,Mv race origin to hear.When kings a daughter hand bestow,\\'Tis right their line and fame to show.There was a king whose deeds and worthSpread wide his name through heaven and earth,Nimi, most virtuous e\\'en from youth,The best of all who love the truth.His son and heir was Mithi, andHis Janak, first who ruled this land.He left a son Udávasu,Blest with all virtues, good and true.His son was Nandivardhan, dearFor pious heart and worth sincere.His son Suketu, hero brave,To Devarát, existence gave.King Devarát, a royal sage,For virtue, glory of the age,Begot Vrihadratha; and heBegot, his worthy heir to be,The splendid hero MahábírWho long in glory governed here.His son was Sudhriti, a youthFirm in his purpose, brave in sooth,His son was Dhristaketu, blestWith pious will and holy breast.The fame of royal saint he won:Haryasva was his princely son.Haryasva son was Maru, whoBegot Pratíndhak, wise and true.Next Kírtiratha held the throne,His son, for gentle virtues known.Then followed Devamidha, thenVibudh, Mahándhrak, kings of men.Mahándhrak son, of boundless might,Was Kírtirát, who loved the right.He passed away, a sainted king,And Maháromá followingTo Swarnaromá left the state.Then Hrasvaromá, good and great,Succeeded, and to him a pairOf sons his royal consort bare,Elder of these I boast to be:Brave Kusadhwaj is next to me.(251)Me then, the elder of the twain,My sire anointed here to reign.He bade me tend my brother well,Then to the forest went to dwell.He sought the heavens, and I sustainedThe burden as by law ordained,And noble Kusadhwaj, the peerOf Gods, I ever held most dear.Then came Sánkásyá mighty lord,Sudhanvá, threatening siege and sword,And bade me swift on him bestowSiva incomparable bow,And Sítá of the lotus eyes:But I refused each peerless prize.Then, host to host, we met the foes,And fierce the din of battle rose,Sudhanvá, foremost of his band,Fell smitten by my single hand.When thus Sánkásyá lord was slain,I sanctified, as laws ordain,My brother in his stead to reign,Thus are we brothers, Saint most highThe younger he, the elder I.Now, mighty Sage, my spirit joysTo give these maidens to the boys.Let Sítá be to Ráma tied.And Urmilá be Lakshman bride.First give, O King, the gift of cows,As dowry of each royal spouse,Due offerings to the spirits pay,And solemnize the wedding-day.The moon tonight, O royal Sage,In Maghá(252) House takes harbourage;On the third night his rays benignIn second Phálguni(253) will shine:Be that the day, with prosperous fate,The nuptial rites to celebrate.\"Canto LXXII. The Gift Of Kine.When royal Janak words were done,Joined with Vasishtha Kusik son,The mighty sage began his speech:\"No mind may soar, no thought can reachThe glories of Ikshváku line,Or, great Videha King, of thine:None in the whole wide world may vieWith them in fame and honours high.Well matched, I ween, in holy bands,These peerless pairs will join their hands.But hear me as I speak once more;Thy brother, skilled in duty lore,Has at his home a royal pairOf daughters most divinely fair.I for the hands of these sweet twoFor Bharat and Satrughna sue,Both princes of heroic mould,Wise, fair of form, and lofty-souled.All Dasaratha sons, I ween,Own each young grace of form and mien:Brave as the Gods are they, nor yieldTo the great Lords the worlds who shield.By these, good Prince of merits high,Ikshváku house with thine ally.\"The suit the holy sage preferred,With willing ear the monarch heard:Vasishtha lips the counsel praised:Then spake the king with hands upraised:\"Now blest indeed my race I deem,Which your high will, O Saints supreme,With Dasaratha house unitesIn bonds of love and marriage rites.So be it done. My nieces twainLet Bharat and Satrughna gain,And the four youths the selfsame dayFour maiden hands in theirs shall lay.No day so lucky may compare,For marriage--so the wise declare--With the last day of PhálguniRuled by the genial deity.\"Then with raised hands in reverence dueTo those arch-saints he spoke anew:\"I am your pupil, ever true:To me high favour have ye shown;Come, sit ye on my royal throne,For Dasaratha rules these towersE\\'en as Ayodhyá now is ours.Do with your own whate\\'er ye choose:Your lordship here will none refuse.\"He spoke, and to Videha kingThus Dasaratha, answering:\"Boundless your virtues, lords, whose swayThe realms of Mithilá obey.With honouring care you entertain.Both holy sage and royal train.Now to my house my steps I bend--May blessings still on you at end--Due offerings to the shades to pay.\"Thus spoke the king, and turned away:To Janak first he bade adieu,Then followed fast those holy two.The monarch reached his palace whereThe rites were paid with solemn care.When the next sun began to shineHe rose and made his gift of kine.A hundred thousand cows preparedFor each young prince the Bráhmans shared.Each had her horns adorned with gold;And duly was the number told,Four hundred thousand perfect tale:Each brought a calf, each filled a pail.And when that glorious task was o\\'er,The monarch with his children four,Showed like the Lord of Life divineWhen the worlds\\' guardians round him shine.Canto LXXIII. The Nuptials.On that same day that saw the kingHis gift of kine distributing,The lord of Kekaya son, by nameYudhájit, Bharat uncle, came,Asked of the monarch health, and thenAddressed the reverend king of men:\"The lord of Kekaya realm by meSends greeting, noble King, to thee:Asks if the friends thy prayers would blessUninterrupted health possess.Right anxious, mighty King, is heMy sister princely boy to see.For this I sought Ayodhyá fairThe message of my sire to bear.There learning, O my liege, that thouWith sons and noble kinsmen nowWast resting here, I sought the placeLonging to see my nephew face.\"The king with kind observance cheeredHis friend by tender ties endeared,And every choicest honour pressedUpon his honourable guest.That night with all his children spent,At morn King Dasaratha went,Behind Vasishtha and the rest,To the fair ground for rites addressed.Then when the lucky hour was nighCalled Victory, of omen high,Came Ráma, after vow and prayerFor nuptial bliss and fortune fair,With the three youths in bright attire,And stood beside his royal sire.To Janak then Vasishtha sped,And to Videha monarch said:\"O King, Ayodhyá ruler nowHas breathed the prayer and vowed the vow,And with his sons expecting standsThe giver of the maidens\\' hands.The giver and the taker bothMust ratify a mutual oath.Perform the part for which we wait,And rites of marriage celebrate.\"Skilled in the laws which Scriptures teach,He answered thus Vasishtha speech:\"O Saint, what warder bars the gate?Whose bidding can the king await?In one own house what doubt is shown?This kingdom, Sage, is all thine own.E\\'en now the maidens may be foundWithin the sacrificial ground:Each vow is vowed and prayed each prayer,And they, like fire, are shining there.Here by the shrine my place I tookExpecting thee with eager look,No bar the nuptial rites should stay:What cause have we for more delay?\"When Janak speech the monarch heard,To sons and saints he gave the word,And set them in the holy ring,Then to Vasishtha spoke the kingOf Mithilá: \"O mighty Sage,Now let this task thy care engage,And lend thine aid and counsel wiseThe nuptial rites to solemnize.\"The saint Vasishtha gave assent,And quickly to the task he went,With Visvámitra, nothing loth,And Satánanda aiding both.Then, as the rules prescribe, they madeAn altar in the midst, and laidFresh wreaths of fragrant flowers thereon.The golden ladles round it shone;And many a vase, which branches hidFixed in the perforated lid,And sprays, and cups, and censers thereStood filled with incense rich and rare;Shell-bowls, and spoons, and salvers dressedWith gifts that greet the honoured guest;Piles of parched rice some dishes bore,Others with corn prepared ran o\\'er;And holy grass was duly spreadIn equal lengths, while prayers were said.Next chief of saints, Vasishtha cameAnd laid the offering in the flame.Then by the hand King Janak drewHis Sítá, beautiful to view,And placed her, bright in rich attire,Ráma to face, before the fire,Thus speaking to the royal boyWho filled Kausalyá heart with joy:\"Here Sítá stands, my daughter fair,The duties of thy life to share.Take from her father, take thy bride;Join hand to hand, and bliss betide!A faithful wife, most blest is she,And as thy shade will follow thee.\"Thus as he spoke the monarch threwO\\'er her young limbs the holy dew,While Gods and saints were heard to swellThe joyous cry, \\'Tis well! \\'Tis well!His daughter Sítá thus bestowed,O\\'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.King Janak heart with rapture glowed.Then to Prince Lakshman thus he cried:\"Take Urmilá thine offered bride,And clasp her hand within thine ownEre yet the lucky hour be flown.\"Then to Prince Bharat thus cried he;\"Come, take the hand of Mándavi.\"Then to Satrughna: \"In thy graspThe hand of Srutakírti clasp.Now, Raghu sons, may all of youBe gentle to your wives and true;Keep well the vows you make to-day,Nor let occasion slip away.\"King Janak word the youths obeyed;The maidens\\' hands in theirs they laid.Then with their brides the princes wentWith ordered steps and reverentRound both the fire and Janak, roundThe sages and the sacred ground.A flowery flood of lucid dyesIn rain descended from the skies,While with celestial voices blentSweet strains from many an instrument,And the nymphs danced in joyous throngResponsive to the minstrel song.Such signs of exultation theySaw on the princes\\' wedding day.Still rang the heavenly music soundWhen Raghu sons thrice circled roundThe fire, each one with reverent head,And homeward then their brides they led.They to the sumptuous palace hiedThat Janak care had seen supplied.The monarch girt with saint and peerStill fondly gazing followed near.Canto LXXIV. Ráma With The Axe.(254)Soon as the night had reached its closeThe hermit Visvámitra rose;To both the kings he bade adieuAnd to the northern hill withdrew.Ayodhyá lord of high renownReceived farewell, and sought his town.Then as each daughter left her bowerKing Janak gave a splendid dower,Rugs, precious silks, a warrior force,Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,Divine to see and well arrayed;And many a skilful tiring-maid,And many a young and trusty slaveThe father of the ladies gave.Silver and coral, gold and pearlsHe gave to his beloved girls.These precious gifts the king bestowedAnd sped his guest upon his road.The lord of Mithilá sweet townRode to his court and lighted down.Ayodhyá monarch, glad and gay,Led by the seers pursued his wayWith his dear sons of lofty mind:The royal army marched behind.As on he fared the voice he heardAround of many a dismal bird,And every beast in wild affrightBegan to hurry to the right.The monarch to Vasishtha cried:\"What strange misfortune will betide?Why do the beasts in terror fly,And birds of evil omen cry?What is it shakes my heart with dread?Why is my soul disquieted?\"Soon as he heard, the mighty saintThus answered Dasaratha plaintIn sweetest tone: \"Now, Monarch, mark,And learn from me the meaning dark.The voices of the birds of airGreat peril to the host declare:The moving beasts the dread allay,So drive thy whelming fear away,\"As he and Dasaratha spokeA tempest from the welkin broke,That shook the spacious earth amainAnd hurled high trees upon the plain.The sun grew dark with murky cloud,And o\\'er the skies was cast a shroud,While o\\'er the army, faint with dread,A veil of dust and ashes spread.King, princes, saints their sense retained,Fear-stupefied the rest remained.At length, their wits returning, allBeneath the gloom and ashy pallSaw Jamadagni son with dread,His long hair twisted round his head,Who, sprung from Bhrigu, loved to beatThe proudest kings beneath his feet.Firm as Kailása hill he showed,Fierce as the fire of doom he glowed.His axe upon his shoulder lay,His bow was ready for the fray,With thirsty arrows wont to flyLike Lightnings from the angry sky.A long keen arrow forth he drew,Invincible like those which flewFrom Siva ever-conquering bowAnd Tripura in death laid low.When his wild form, that struck with awe,Fearful as ravening flame, they saw,Vasishtha and the saints whose careWas sacrifice and muttered prayer,Drew close together, each to each,And questioned thus with bated speech:\"Indignant at his father fateWill he on warriors vent his hate,The slayers of his father slay,And sweep the loathed race away?But when of old his fury ragedSeas of their blood his wrath assuaged:So doubtless now he has not plannedTo slay all warriors in the land.\"Then with a gift the saints drew nearTo Bhrigu son whose look was fear,And Ráma! Ráma! soft they cried.The gift he took, no word replied.Then Bhrigu son his silence brokeAnd thus to Ráma Ráma spoke:Canto LXXV. The Parle.\"Heroic Ráma, men proclaimThe marvels of thy matchless fame,And I from loud-voiced rumour knowThe exploit of the broken bow,Yea, bent and broken, mighty Chief,A feat most wondrous, past belief.Stirred by thy fame thy face I sought:A peerless bow I too have brought.This mighty weapon, strong and dire,Great Jamadagni owned, my sire.Draw with its shaft my father bow,And thus thy might, O Ráma, show.This proof of prowess let me see--The weapon bent and drawn by thee;Then single fight our strength shall try,And this shall raise thy glory high.\"King Dasaratha heard with dreadThe boastful speech, and thus he said;Raising his hands in suppliant guise,With pallid cheek and timid eyes:\"Forgetful of the bloody feudAscetic toils hast thou pursued;Then, Bráhman, let thy children beUntroubled and from danger free.Sprung of the race of Bhrigu, whoRead holy lore, to vows most true,Thou swarest to the Thousand-eyedAnd thy fierce axe was cast aside.Thou turnedst to thy rites awayLeaving the earth to Kasyap sway,And wentest far a grove to seekBeneath Mahendra(255) mountain peak.Now, mighty Hermit, art thou hereTo slay us all with doom severe?For if alone my Ráma fall,We share his fate and perish all.\"As thus the aged sire complainedThe mighty chief no answer deigned.To Ráma only thus he cried:\"Two bows, the Heavenly Artist pride,Celestial, peerless, vast, and strong,By all the worlds were honoured long.One to the Three-eyed God(256) was given,By glory to the conflict driven,Thus armed fierce Tripura he slew:And then by thee \\'twas burst in two.The second bow, which few may brave,The highest Gods to Vishnu gave.This bow I hold; before it fallThe foeman fenced tower and wall.Then prayed the Gods the Sire Most HighBy some unerring proof to tryWere praise for might Lord Vishnu due,Or his whose Neck is stained with Blue.(257)The mighty Sire their wishes knew,And he whose lips are ever trueCaused the two Gods to meet as foes.Then fierce the rage of battle rose:Bristled in dread each starting hairAs Siva strove with Vishnu there.But Vishnu raised his voice amain.And Siva bowstring twanged in vain;Its master of the Three bright EyesStood fixt in fury and surprise.Then all the dwellers in the sky,Minstrel, and saint, and God drew nigh,And prayed them that the strife might cease,And the great rivals met in peace.\\'Twas seen how Siva bow has failedUnnerved, when Vishnu might assailed,And Gods and heavenly sages thenceTo Vishnu gave preëminence.Then glorious Siva in his rageGave it to Devarát the sageWho ruled Videha fertile land,To pass it down from hand to hand.But this my bow, whose shafts smite downThe foeman fenced tower and town,To great Richíka Vishnu lentTo be a pledge and ornament,Then Jamadagni, Bráhman dread,My sire, the bow inherited.But Arjun stooped to treachery vileAnd slew my noble sire by guile,Whose penance awful strength had gained,Whose hand the God-given bow retained.I heard indignant how he fellBy mournful fate, too sad to tell.My vengeful fury since that timeScourges all Warriors for the crime.As generations spring to lifeI war them down in endless strife.All earth I brought beneath my sway,And gave it for his meed and payTo holy Kasyap, when of yoreThe rites performed by him were o\\'er.Then to Mahendra hill I turnedStrong in the strength that penance earned,And toiled upon his lofty headBy Gods immortal visited.The breaking of the bow I knewFrom startled Gods conversing, throughThe airy regions, of thy deed,And hither came with swiftest speed.Now, for thy Warrior honour sake,This best of bows, O Ráma, take:This, owned by Vishnu self of old,My sire and grandsire loved to hold.Drawn to its head upon the string,One town-destroying arrow bring;If this thou can, O hero, IIn single fight thy strength will try.\"Canto LXXVI. Debarred From Heaven.The haughty challenge, undeterredThe son of Dasaratha heard,And cried, while reverence for his sireChecked the full torrent of his ire:\"Before this day have I been toldThe deed that stained thy hands of old.But pity bids my soul forget:Thy father, murdered, claimed the debt.My strength, O Chief, thou deemest slight,Too feeble for a Warrior might.Now will I show thy wondering eyesThe prowess which they dare despise.\"He hastened then with graceful easeThat mighty bow and shaft to seize.His hand the weapon strung and swayed:The arrow on the string was laid.Then Jamadagni son he eyed,And thus in words of fury cried:\"Thou art a Bráhman, still to beMost highly honoured, Chief, by me.For Visvámitra sake besideShall reverence due be ne\\'er denied.Though mine the power, I would not sendA dart at thee thy life to end.But thy great power to wander free,Which penance-rites have won for thee,Or glorious worlds from thee to wrest,Is the firm purpose of my breast,And Vishnu dart which now I strainCan ne\\'er be shot to fall in vain:It strikes the mighty, and it stunsThe madness of the haughty ones.\"Then Gods, and saints and heavenly choirPreceded by the General Sire,Met in the air and gazed belowOn Ráma with that wondrous bow.Nymph, minstrel, angel, all were there,Snake-God, and spirit of the air,Giant, and bard, and gryphon, met,Their eyes upon the marvel set.In senseless hush the world was chainedWhile Ráma hand the bow retained,And Jamadagni son amazedAnd powerless on the hero gazed.Then when his swelling heart had shrunk,And his proud strength in torpor sunk,Scarce his voice ventured, low and weak,To Ráma lotus-eyed, to speak:\"When long ago I gave awayThe whole broad land to Kasyap swayHe charged me never to remainWithin the limits of his reign.Obedient to my guide behestOn earth by night I never rest.My choice is made, I will not dimMine honour and be false to him.So, son of Raghu, leave me stillThe power to wander where I will,And swifter than the thought my flightShall place me on Mahendra height.My mansions of eternal joy,By penance won, thou mayst destroy,My path to these thy shaft may stay.Now to the work! No more delay!I know thee Lord of Gods; I knowThy changeless might laid Madhu low.All other hands would surely failTo bend this bow. All hail! all hail!See! all the Gods have left the skiesTo bend on thee their eager eyes,With whose achievements none compete,Whose arm in war no God can meet.No shame is mine, I ween, for thou,Lord of the Worlds, hast dimmed my brow.Now, pious Ráma, \\'tis thy partTo shoot afar that glorious dart:I, when the fatal shaft is shot,Will seek that hill and tarry not.\"He ceased. The wondrous arrow flew,And Jamadagni offspring knewThose glorious worlds to him were barred,Once gained by penance long and hard.Then straight the airy quarters cleared,And the mid regions bright appeared,While Gods and saints unnumbered praisedRáma, the mighty bow who raised.And Jamadagni son, o\\'erawed.Extolled his name with highest laud,With reverent steps around him strode,Then hastened on his airy road.Far from the sight of all he fled,And rested on Mahendra head.Canto LXXVII. Bharat Departure.Then Ráma with a cheerful mindThe bow to Varun hand resigned.Due reverence to the saints he paid,And thus addressed his sire dismayed:\"As Bhrigu son is far from view,Now let the host its march pursue,And to Ayodhyá town proceedIn four-fold bands, with thee to lead.\"King Dasaratha thus addressedHis lips to Ráma forehead pressed,And held him to his aged breast.Rejoiced in sooth was he to knowThat Bhrigu son had parted so,And hailed a second life begunFor him and his victorious son.He urged the host to speed renewed,And soon Ayodhyá gates he viewed.High o\\'er the roofs gay pennons played;Tabour and drum loud music made;Fresh water cooled the royal road,And flowers in bright profusion glowed.Glad crowds with garlands thronged the waysRejoicing on their king to gazeAnd all the town was bright and gayExalting in the festive day.People and Bráhmans flocked to meetTheir monarch ere he gained the street.The glorious king amid the throngRode with his glorious sons along,And passed within his dear abodeThat like Himálaya mountain showed.And there Kausalyá, noble queen,Sumitrá with her lovely mien,Kaikeyí of the dainty waist,And other dames his bowers who graced,Stood in the palace side by sideAnd welcomed home each youthful bride:Fair Sítá, lofty-fated dame,Urmilá of the glorious fame,And Kusadhwaj children fair,With joyous greeting and with prayer,As all in linen robes arrayedWith offerings at the altars prayed.Due reverence paid to God above,Each princess gave her soul to love,And hidden in her inmost bowerPassed with her lord each blissful hour.The royal youths, of spirit high,With whom in valor none could vie,Lived each within his palace boundsBright as Kuvera pleasure-grounds,With riches, troops of faithful friends,And bliss that wedded life attends:Brave princes trained in warlike skill,And duteous to their father will.At length the monarch called one mornPrince Bharat, of Kaikeyí born,And cried: \"My son, within our gatesLord Yudhájit thine uncle waits.The son of Kekaya king is he,And came, my child, to summon thee.\"Then Bharat for the road prepared,And with Satrughna forth he fared.First to his sire he bade adieu,Brave Ráma, and his mothers too.Lord Yudhájit with joyful prideWent forth, the brothers by his side,And reached the city where he dwelt:And mighty joy his father felt.Ráma and Lakshman honoured stillTheir godlike sire with duteous will.Two constant guides for Ráma stood,His father wish, the people good.Attentive to the general wealHe thought and wrought to please and heal.His mothers too he strove to pleaseWith love and sonly courtesies.At every time, in every spot,His holy guides he ne\\'er forgot.So for his virtues kind and trueDearer and dearer Ráma grewTo Dasaratha, Bráhmans, allIn town and country, great and small.And Ráma by his darling sideSaw many a blissful season glide,Lodged in her soul, each thought on her,Lover, and friend, and worshipper.He loved her for his father voiceHad given her and approved the choice:He loved her for each charm she woreAnd her sweet virtues more and more.So he her lord and second lifeDwelt in the bosom of his wife,In double form, that, e\\'en apart,Each heart could commune free with heart.Still grew that child of Janak race,More goddess-fair in form and face,The loveliest wife that e\\'er was seen,In mortal mould sweet Beauty Queen.Then shone the son Kausalyá bore,With this bright dame allied,Like Vishnu whom the Gods adore,With Lakshmi by his side.',\n",
       " 'BOOK 2': 'Canto I. The Heir Apparent.So Bharat to his grandsire wentObedient to the message sent,And for his fond companion choseSatrughna slayer of his foes.(258)There Bharat for a time remainedWith love and honour entertained,King Asvapati constant care,Beloved as a son and heir.Yet ever, as they lived at ease,While all around combined to please,The aged sire they left behindWas present to each hero mind.Nor could the king fond memory strayFrom his brave children far away,Dear Bharat and Satrughna dear,Each Varun match or Indra peer.To all the princes, young and brave,His soul with fond affection clave;Around his loving heart they clungLike arms from his own body sprung.(259)But best and noblest of the four,Good as the God whom all adore,Lord of all virtues, undefiled,His darling was his eldest child.For he was beautiful and strong,From envy free, the foe of wrong,With all his father virtues blest,And peerless in the world confessed.With placid soul he softly spoke:No harsh reply could taunts provoke.He ever loved the good and sageRevered for virtue and for age,And when his martial tasks were o\\'erSate listening to their peaceful lore.Wise, modest, pure, he honoured eld,His lips from lying tales withheld;Due reverence to the Bráhmans gave,And ruled each passion like a slave.Most tender, prompt at duty call,Loved by all men he loved them all.Proud of the duties of his race,With spirit meet for Warrior place.He strove to win by glorious deed,Throned with the Gods, a priceless meed.With him in speech and quick replyVrihaspati might hardly vie,But never would his accents flowFor evil or for empty show.In art and science duly trained,His student vow he well maintained;He learnt the lore for princes fit,The Vedas and their Holy Writ,And with his well-drawn bow at lastHis mighty father fame surpassed.Of birth exalted, truthful, just,With vigorous hand, with noble trust,Well taught by aged twice-born menWho gain and right could clearly ken,Full well the claims and bounds he knewOf duty, gain, and pleasure too:Of memory keen, of ready tact,In civil business prompt to act.Reserved, his features ne\\'er disclosedWhat counsel in his heart reposed.All idle rage and mirth controlled,He knew the times to give and hold,Firm in his faith, of steadfast will,He sought no wrong, he spoke no ill:Not rashly swift, not idly slow,His faults and others\\' keen to know.Each merit, by his subtle sense;He matched with proper recompense.He knew the means that wealth provide,And with keen eye expense could guide.Wild elephants could he reclaim,And mettled steeds could mount and tame.No arm like his the bow could wield,Or drive the chariot to the field.Skilled to attack, to deal the blow,Or lead a host against the foe:Yea, e\\'en infuriate Gods would fearTo meet his arm in full career.As the great sun in noontide blazeIs glorious with his world of rays,So Ráma with these virtues shoneWhich all men loved to gaze upon.The aged monarch fain would rest,And said within his weary breast,\"Oh that I might, while living yet,My Ráma o\\'er the kingdom set.And see, before my course be run,The hallowed drops anoint my son;See all this spacious land obey,From side to side, my first-born sway,And then, my life and joy complete,Obtain in heaven a blissful seat!\"In him the monarch saw combinedThe fairest form, the noblest mind,And counselled how his son might share,The throne with him as Regent Heir.For fearful signs in earth and sky,And weakness warned him death was nigh:But Ráma to the world endearedBy every grace his bosom cheered,The moon of every eye, whose rayDrove all his grief and fear away.So duty urged that hour to seize,Himself, his realm, to bless and please.From town and country, far and near,He summoned people, prince, and peer.To each he gave a meet abode,And honoured all and gifts bestowed.Then, splendid in his king attire,He viewed them, as the general Sire,In glory of a God arrayed,Looks on the creatures he has made.But Kekaya king he called not thenFor haste, nor Janak, lord of men;For after to each royal friendThe joyful tidings he would send.Mid crowds from distant countries metThe king upon his throne was set;Then honoured by the people, allThe rulers thronged into the hall.On thrones assigned, each king in placeLooked silent on the monarch face.Then girt by lords of high renownAnd throngs from hamlet and from townHe showed in regal pride,As, honoured by the radiant bandOf blessed Gods that round him stand,Lord Indra, Thousand-eyed.Canto II. The People Speech.Then to the full assembly bowedThe monarch, and addressed the crowdWith gracious speech, in accents loudAs heavenly drum or thunder-cloud:\"Needs not to you who know declareHow ever with paternal careMy fathers of Ikshváku lineHave ruled the realm which now is mine.I too have taught my feet to treadThe pathway of the mighty dead,And with fond care that never sleptHave, as I could, my people kept.So toiling still, and ne\\'er remissFor all my people weal and bliss,Beneath the white umbrella(260) shade.Old age is come and strength decayed.Thousands of years have o\\'er me flown,And generations round me grownAnd passed away. I crave at lengthRepose and ease for broken strength.Feeble and worn I scarce can bearThe ruler toil, the judge care,With royal dignity, a weightThat tries the young and temperate.I long to rest, my labour done,And in my place to set my son,If to the twice-born gathered hereMy counsel wise and good appear.For greater gifts than mine adornRáma my son, my eldest-born.Like Indra brave, before him fallThe foeman cities, tower and wall.Him prince of men for power and might,The best maintainer of the right,Fair as the moon when nothing barsHis glory close to Pushya stars,Him with to-morrow light I fainWould throne the consort of my reign.A worthy lord for you, I ween,Marked as her own by Fortune Queen.The triple world itself would beWell ruled by such a king as he.To such high bliss and happy fateWill I the country dedicate,And my sad heart will cease to grieveIf he the precious charge receive.Thus is my careful plan matured,Thus for myself is rest secured;Lieges, approve the words I say,Or point ye out some wiser way.Devise your prudent plan. My mindIs fondly to this thought inclined,But men by keen debating moveSome middle course which all approve.\"The monarch ceased. In answer cameThe joyous princes\\' glad acclaim.So peacocks in the rain rejoiceAnd hail the cloud with lifted voice.Murmurs of joy from thousands roundShook the high palace with the sound.Then when the gathered throng had learnedHis will who right and gain discerned,Peasant and townsman, priest and chief,All met in consultation brief,And soon agreed with one accordGave answer to their sovereign lord:\"King of the land, we know thee old:Thousands of years have o\\'er thee rolled,Ráma thy son, we pray, anoint,And at thy side his place appointOur gallant prince, so brave and strong,Riding in royal state along,Our eyes with joyful pride will seeScreened by the shade that shelters thee.\"Then spake the king again, as thoughTheir hearts\\' true wish he sought to know:\"These prayers for Ráma rule suggestOne question to my doubting breast.This thing, I pray, with truth explain:Why would ye, while I justly reign,That he, mine eldest son, should bearHis part with me as ruling heir?\"Then all the people made reply,Peasant and townsman, low and high:\"Each noblest gift of form and mind,O Monarch, in thy son we find.Do thou the godlike virtues hearWhich Ráma to our hearts endear.So richly blest with graces, noneIn all the earth excels thy son:Nay, who to match with him may claimIn truth, in justice, and in fame?True to his promise, gentle, kind,Unenvious, of grateful mind,Versed in the law and firm of soul,He keeps each sense with strict control.With duteous care he loves to sitBy Bráhmans skilled in Holy Writ.Hence brightest glory, ne\\'er to end,And matchless fame his youth attend.Skilled in the use of spear and shield,And arms which heavenly warriors wield,Supreme in war, unconquered yetBy man, fiend, God in battle met,Whene\\'er in pomp of war he goes\\'Gainst town or city of the foes,He ever comes with Lakshman backVictorious from the fierce attack.Returning homeward from afarBorne on his elephant or car,He ever to the townsmen bendsAnd greets them as beloved friends,Asks how each son, each servant thrives,How fare our pupils, offerings, wives;And like a father bids us tell,Each for himself, that all is well.If pain or grief the city triesHis heart is swift to sympathize.When festive scenes our thoughts employHe like a father shares the joy.High is the fate, O King, that gaveThy Ráma born to bless and save,With filial virtues fair and mildLike Kasyap old Maríchi child.Hence to the kingdom distant endsOne general prayer for him ascends.Each man in town and country praysFor Ráma strength, health, length of days.With hearts sincere, their wish the same,The tender girl, the aged dame,Subject and stranger, peasant, hind,One thought impressed on every mind,At evening and at dawning dayTo all the Gods for Ráma pray.Do thou, O King, of grace comply,And hear the people longing cry,And let us on the throne by theeThe lotus-tinted Ráma see.O thou who givest boons, attend;A gracious ear, O Monarch, lendAnd for our weal install,Consenting to our earnest prayer,Thy godlike Ráma Regent Heir,Who seeks the good of all.\"Canto III. Dasaratha Precepts.The monarch with the prayer compliedOf suppliant hands, on every sideUplifted like a lotus-bed:And then these gracious words he said:\"Great joy and mighty fame are mineBecause your loving hearts incline,In full assembly clearly shownTo place my Ráma on the throne.\"Then to Vasishtha, standing near,And Vámadeva loud and clearThe monarch spoke that all might hear:\"\\'Tis pure and lovely Chaitra nowWhen flowers are sweet on every bough;All needful things with haste prepareThat Ráma be appointed heir.\"Then burst the people rapture outIn loud acclaim and joyful shout;And when the tumult slowly ceasedThe king addressed the holy priest:\"Give order, Saint, with watchful heedFor what the coming rite will need.This day let all things ready waitMine eldest son to consecrate.\"Best of all men of second birthVasishtha heard the lord of earth,And gave commandment to the bandsOf servitors with lifted handsWho waited on their master eye:\"Now by to-morrow dawn supplyRich gold and herbs and gems of priceAnd offerings for the sacrifice,Wreaths of white flowers and roasted rice,And oil and honey, separate;New garments and a car of state,An elephant with lucky signs,A fourfold host in ordered lines,The white umbrella, and a pairOf chowries,(261) and a banner fair;A hundred vases, row on row,To shine like fire in splendid glow,A tiger mighty skin, a bullWith gilded horns most beautiful.All these, at dawn of coming day,Around the royal shrine array,Where burns the fire undying ray.Each palace door, each city gateWith wreaths of sandal decorate.And with the garlands\\' fragrant scentLet clouds of incense-smoke be blent.Let food of noble kind and tasteBe for a hundred thousand placed;Fresh curds with streams of milk bedewedTo feed the Bráhman multitude.With care be all their wants supplied.And mid the twice-born chiefs divideRich largess, with the early morn,And oil and curds and roasted corn.Soon as the sun has shown his lightPronounce the prayer to bless the rite,And then be all the Bráhmans calledAnd in their ordered seats installed.Let all musicians skilled to play,And dancing-girls in bright arrayStand ready in the second ringWithin the palace of the king.Each honoured tree, each holy shrineWith leaves and flowery wreaths entwine,And here and there beneath the shadeBe food prepared and presents laid.Then brightly clad, in warlike guise,With long swords girt upon their thighs,Let soldiers of the nobler sortMarch to the monarch splendid court.\"Thus gave command the twice-born pairTo active servants stationed there.Then hastened to the king and saidThat all their task was duly sped,The king to wise Sumantra spake:\"Now quick, my lord, thy chariot take,And hither with thy swiftest speedMy son, my noble Ráma lead.\"Sumantra, ere the word was given,His chariot from the court had driven,And Ráma, best of all who rideIn cars, came sitting by his side.The lords of men had hastened forthFrom east and west and south and north,Áryan and stranger, those who dwellIn the wild wood and on the fell,And as the Gods to Indra, theyShowed honour to the king that day.Like Vásav, when his glorious formIs circled by the Gods of storm,Girt in his hall by kings he sawHis car-borne Ráma near him draw,Like him who rules the minstrel bandOf heaven;(262) whose valour filled the land,Of mighty arm and stately prideLike a wild elephant in stride,As fair in face as that fair stoneDear to the moon, of moonbeams grown,(263)With noble gifts and grace that tookThe hearts of all, and chained each look,World-cheering as the Lord of RainWhen floods relieve the parching plain.The father, as the son came nigh,Gazed with an ever-thirstier eye.Sumantra helped the prince alightFrom the good chariot passing bright,And as to meet his sire he wentFollowed behind him reverent.Then Ráma clomb, the king to seekThat terrace like Kailása peak,And reached the presence of the king,Sumantra closely following.Before his father face he came,Raised suppliant hands and named his name,(264)And bowing lowly as is meetPaid reverence to the monarch feet.But soon as Dasaratha viewedThe prince in humble attitude,He raised him by the hand in hasteAnd his beloved son embraced,Then signed him to a glorious throne,Gem-decked and golden, near his own.Then Ráma, best of Raghu line,Made the fair seat with lustre shineAs when the orient sun upspringsAnd his pure beam on Meru flings.The glory flashed on roof and wall,And with strange sheen suffused the hall,As when the moon pure rays are sentThrough autumn star-lit firmament.Then swelled his breast with joy and prideAs his dear son the father eyed,E\\'en as himself more fair arrayedIn some clear mirror face displayed.The aged monarch gazed awhile,Then thus addressed him with a smile,As Kasyap, whom the worlds revere,Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:\"O thou of all my sons most dear,In virtue best, thy father peer,Child of my consort first in place,Mine equal in her pride of race,Because the people hearts are boundTo thee by graces in thee found,Be thou in Pushya favouring hourMade partner of my royal power.I know that thou by nature bentBoth modest art and excellent,But though thy gifts no counsel needMy love suggests the friendly rede.Mine own dear son, be modest still,And rule each sense with earnest will.Keep thou the evils far awayThat spring from love and anger sway.Thy noble course alike pursueIn secret as in open view,And every nerve, the love to gainOf ministers and subjects, strain.The happy prince who sees with prideHis thriving people satisfied;Whose arsenals with arms are stored,And treasury with golden hoard,--His friends rejoice as joyed the BlestWhen Amrit crowned their eager quest.So well, my child, thy course maintain,And from all ill thy soul refrain.\"The friends of Ráma, gathered nigh,Longing their lord to gratify,Ran to Kausalyá bower to tellThe tidings that would please her well.She, host of dames, with many a gem,And gold, and kine rewarded them.Then Ráma paid the reverence due,Mounted the chariot, and withdrew,And to his splendid dwelling droveWhile crowds to show him honour strove.The people, when the monarch speechTheir willing ears had heard,Were wild with joy as though on eachGreat gifts had been conferred.With meek and low salute each manTurned to his home away,And there with happy heart beganTo all the Gods to pray.Canto IV. Ráma Summoned.The crowd dismissed, to high debateThe monarch called his peers of state,And, counsel from their lips obtained,Firm in his will his will explained:\"To-morrow with auspicious rayThe moon in Pushya sign will stay;Be that the time with happy fateMine eldest son to consecrate,And let my Ráma, lotus-eyed,As Regent o\\'er the state preside.\"He sought, within, his charioteer,And cried \"Again bring Ráma here.\"To Ráma home Sumantra hiedAgain to be the prince guide.His coming, told to Ráma ear,Suggested anxious doubt and fear.He bade the messenger be ledThat instant in, and thus he said:\"Tell me the cause, omitting naught,Why thou again my house hast sought.\"The envoy answered: \"Prince, thy sireHas sent thy presence to require.My sender known, \\'tis thine to sayIf thou wilt go or answer nay.\"Then Ráma, when he heard his speech,Made haste the royal court to reach.Soon as the monarch was awareHis dearest son was waiting there,Eager the parley to beginHe bade them lead the prince within,Soon as he passed the chamber doorThe hero bent him to the floor,And at a distance from his seatRaised his joined hands his sire to greet.The monarch raised him from the ground,And loving arms about him wound,Then pointed to a seat that shoneWith gold for him to rest upon.\"Aged am I,\" he said, \"and worn;In life best joys my share have borne;Rites to the Gods, in hundreds, paid,With gifts of corn and largess made.I yearned for sons: my life is blestWith them and thee of sons the best.No debt to saints or Bráhmans, no,Nor spirits, Gods, or self I owe.One duty now remains alone,To set thee on thy father throne.Now therefore, Ráma, hear my rede,And mark my words with duteous heed:This day the peoples\\' general voice,Elects thee king of love and choice,And I, consenting to the prayer,Will make thee, darling, Regent Heir.Dread visions, each returning night,With evil omens scare my sight.Red meteors with a fearful soundShoot wildly downward to the ground,While tempests lash the troubled air;And they who read the stars declareThat, leagued against my natal sign,Ráhu,(265) the Sun,(266) and Mars combine.When portents dire as these appear,A monarch death or woe is near.Then while my senses yet are spared,And thought and will are unimpaired,Be thou, my son, anointed king:Men fancy is a fickle thing.To-day the moon, in order due,Entered the sign Punarvasu,(267)To-morrow, as the wise foretell,In Pushya favouring stars will dwell:Then on the throne shalt thou be placed.My soul, prophetic, counsels haste:Thee, O my son, to-morrow IAs Regent Heir will sanctify.So till the coming night be passedDo thou and Sítá strictly fast:From worldly thoughts thy soul refrain,And couched on holy grass remain.And let thy trusted lords attendIn careful watch upon their friend,For, unexpected, check and barOur weightiest counsels often mar.While Bharat too is far awayMaking with royal kin his stay,I deem the fittest time of allThee, chosen Regent, to install.It may be Bharat still has stoodTrue to the counsels of the good,Faithful to thee with tender trust,With governed senses, pure and just.But human minds, too well I know,Will sudden changes undergo,And by their constant deeds aloneThe virtue of the good is shown.Now, Ráma, go. My son, good night!Fixt is to-morrow for the rite.\"Then Ráma paid the reverence due,And quickly to his home withdrew.He passed within, nor lingered there,But sought his mother mansion, whereThe dame in linen robes arrayedDevoutly in the chapel prayedTo Fortune Queen, with utterance checked,That she her Ráma would protect.There was Sumitrá too, and thereWas Lakshman led by loving care:And when the royal choice they knewSítá in haste was summoned too.Absorbed, with half-shut eyes, the queenAttended by the three was seen.She knew that Pushya lucky hourWould raise her son to royal power,So fixed with bated breath each thoughtOn God supreme, by all men sought.To her, as thus she knelt and prayed,Ráma drew near, due reverence paid,And then to swell his mother joy,Thus spoke her own beloved boy;\"O mother dear, my sire decreeEntrusts the people weal to me.To-morrow I, for so his will,Anointed king, the throne shall fill.The few last hours till night shall endSítá with me must fasting spend,For so my father has decreed,And holy priests with him agreed.What vows soever thou mayst deemMy consecration eve beseem,Do thou, sweet mother, for my sakeAnd for beloved Sítá make.\"When the glad news Kausalyá heard,So long desired, so long deferred,While tears of joy her utterance broke,In answer to her son she spoke:\"Long be thy life, my darling: nowThy prostrate foes before thee bow.Live long and with thy bright successMy friends and dear Sumitrá bless.Surely the stars were wondrous fairWhen thee, sweet son, thy mother bare,That thy good gifts such love inspireAnd win the favour of thy sire.With thee I travailed not in vain;Those lotus eyes reward my pain,And all the glory of the lineOf old Ikshváku will be thine.\"He smiled, and on his brother gazedWho sate with reverent hands upraised,And said: \"My brother, thou must beJoint-ruler of this land with me.My second self thou, Lakshman, art,And in my fortune bearest part.Be thine, Sumitrá son, to knowThe joys from regal power that flow.My life itself, the monarch seat,For thy dear sake to me are sweet.\"Thus Ráma to his brother said,To both his mothers(268) bowed his head,And then with Sítá by his sideTo his own house the hero hied.Canto V. Ráma Fast.Then Saint Vasishtha to the kingCame ready at his summoning.\"Now go,\" exclaimed the monarch, \"thouEnriched by fervent rite and vow,For Ráma and his wife ordainThe fast, that joy may bless his reign.\"The best of those who Scripture knowSaid to the king, \"My lord, I go.\"To Ráma house Vasishtha hied,The hero fast by rule to guide,And skilled in sacred texts to tellEach step to him instructed well.Straight to Prince Ráma high abode,That like a cloud pale-tinted showed,Borne in his priestly car he rode.Two courts he passed, and in the thirdHe stayed his car. Then Ráma heardThe holy sage was come, and flewTo honour him with honour due.He hastened to the car and lentHis hand to aid the priest descent.Then spoke Vasishtha words like these,Pleased with his reverent courtesies,With pleasant things his heart to cheerWho best deserved glad news to hear:\"Prince, thou hast won thy father grace,And thine will be the Regent place:Now with thy Sítá, as is right,In strictest fasting spend the night,For when the morrow dawn is fairThe king will consecrate his heir:So Nahush,(269) as the wise relate,Yayáti joyed to consecrate.\"Thus having said, Vasishtha nextOrdained the fast by rule and text,For Ráma faithful to his vowsAnd the Videhan dame his spouse.Then from the prince house he hiedWith courteous honours gratified.Round Ráma gathered every friendIn pleasant talk a while to spend.He bade good night to all at last,And to his inner chamber passed.Then Ráma house shone bright and gayWith men and maids in glad array,As in the morning some fair lakeWhen all her lotuses awake,And every bird that loves the floodFlits joyous round each opening bud.Forth from the house Vasishtha drove,That with the king in splendour strove,And all the royal street he viewedFilled with a mighty multitudeThe eager concourse blocked each square,Each road and lane and thoroughfare,And joyous shouts on every sideRose like the roar of Ocean tide,As streams of men together cameWith loud huzza and glad acclaim.The ways were watered, swept and clean,And decked with flowers and garlands greenAnd all Ayodhyá shone arrayedWith banners on the roofs that played.Men, women, boys with eager eyes,Expecting when the sun should rise,Stood longing for the herald rayOf Ráma consecration day,To see, a source of joy to all,The people-honoured festival.The priest advancing slowly throughThe mighty crowd he cleft in two,Near to the monarch palace drew.He sought the terrace, by the stair,Like a white cloud-peak high in air,The reverend king of men to meetWho sate upon his splendid seat:Thus will Vrihaspati ariseTo meet the monarch of the skies.But when the king his coming knew,He left his throne and near him drewQuestioned by him Vasishtha saidThat all his task was duly sped.Then all who sate there, honouringVasishtha, rose as rose the king.Vasishtha bade his lord adieu,And all the peers, dismissed, withdrew.Then as a royal lion seeksHis cave beneath the rocky peaks,So to the chambers where abodeHis consorts Dasaratha strode.Full-thronged were those delightful bowersWith women richly dressed,And splendid as the radiant towersWhere Indra loves to rest.Then brighter flashed a thousand eyesWith the light his presence lent,As, when the moon begins to riseThe star thronged firmament.Canto VI. The City Decorated.Then Ráma bathed in order due,His mind from worldly thoughts withdrew,And with his large-eyed wife besoughtNáráyan, as a votary ought.Upon his head the brimming cupOf holy oil he lifted up,Then placed within the kindled fireThe offering to that heavenly Sire,And as he sipped the remnant prayedTo Him for blessing and for aid.Then with still lips and tranquil mindWith his Videhan he reclined,In Vishnu chapel, on a bedWhere holy grass was duly spread,While still the prince every thoughtThe God supreme, Náráyan, sought.One watch remained the night to closeWhen Ráma from his couch arose,And bade the men and maids adornHis palace for the solemn morn.He heard the bards and heralds raiseAuspicious strains of joy and praise;And breathed devout, with voice restrained,The hymn for morning rites ordained;Then, with his head in reverence bowed,Praised Madhu conquering foe aloud,And, in pure linen robes arrayed,The priests to raise their voices prayed.Obedient to the summons theyProclaimed to all the festal day.The Bráhmans\\' voices, deep and sweet,Resounded through the crowded street,And echoed through Ayodhyá wentBy many a loud-toned instrument.Then all the people joyed to hearThat Ráma with his consort dearHad fasted till the morning lightIn preparation for the rite.Swiftly the joyful tidings throughAyodhyá crowded city flew,And soon as dawn appeared, each manTo decorate the town began.In all the temples bright and fairAs white clouds towering in the air,In streets, and where the cross-ways met,Where holy fig-trees had been set,In open square, in sacred shade,Where merchants\\' shops their wealth displayed,On all the mansions of the great,And householders of wealth and state,Where\\'er the people loved to meet,Where\\'er a tree adorned the street,Gay banners floated to the wind,And ribands round the staves were twined.Then clear the singers\\' voices rang,As, charming mind and ear, they sang.Here players shone in bright attire,There dancing women swelled the quire.Each with his friend had much to sayOf Ráma consecration-day:Yea, even children, as they playedAt cottage doors beneath the shade.The royal street with flowers was strownWhich loving hands in heaps had thrown,And here and there rich incense lentIts fragrance to the garland scent;And all was fresh and fair and brightIn honour of the coming rite.With careful foresight to illumeWith borrowed blaze the midnight gloom,The crowds erected here and thereTrees in each street gay lamps to bear.The city thus from side to sideIn festal guise was beautified.The people of the town who longedTo view the rite together thronged,And filling every court and squarePraised the good king in converse there:\"Our high-souled king! He throws a graceOn old Ikshváku royal race.He feels his years\\' increasing weight,And makes his son associate.Great joy to us the choice will bringOf Ráma for our lord and king.The good and bad to him are known,And long will he protect his own.No pride his prudent breast may swell,Most just, he loves his brothers well,And to us all that love extends,Cherished as brothers and as friends.Long may our lord in life remain,Good Dasaratha, free from stain,By whose most gracious favour weRáma anointed king shall see.\"Such were the words the townsmen spokeHeard by the gathering countryfolk,Who from the south, north, east, and west,Stirred by the joyful tidings, pressed.For by their eager longing ledTo Ráma consecration spedThe villagers from every side,And filled Ayodhyá city wide.This way and that way strayed the crowd,While rose a murmur long and loud,As when the full moon floods the skiesAnd Ocean waves with thunder rise.That town, like Indra city fair,While peasants thronged her ways,Tumultuous roared like Ocean, whereEach flood-born monster plays.Canto VII. Manthará Lament.It chanced a slave-born handmaid, bredWith Queen Kaikeyí, fancy-led,Mounted the stair and stood uponThe terrace like the moon that shone.Thence Manthará at ease surveyedAyodhyá to her eyes displayed,Where water cooled the royal street,Where heaps of flowers were fresh and sweet,And costly flags and pennons hungOn roof and tower their shadow flung;With covered ways prepared in haste,And many an awning newly placed;With sandal-scented streams bedewed,Thronged by a new bathed multitude:Whose streets were full of Bráhman bandsWith wreaths and sweetmeats in their hands.Loud instruments their music raised,And through the town, where\\'er she gazed,The doors of temples glittered white,And the maid marvelled at the sight.Of Ráma nurse who, standing by,Gazed with a joy-expanded eye,In robes of purest white attired,The wondering damsel thus inquired:\"Does Ráma mother give awayRich largess to the crowds to-day,On some dear object fondly bent,Or blest with measureless content?What mean these signs of rare delightOn every side that meet my sight?Say, will the king with joy elateSome happy triumph celebrate?\"The nurse, with transport uncontrolled,Her glad tale to the hump-back told:\"Our lord the king to-morrow mornWill consecrate his eldest-born,And raise, in Pushya favouring hour,Prince Ráma to the royal power.\"As thus the nurse her tidings spoke,Rage in the hump-back breast awoke.Down from the terrace, like the headOf high Kailása hill, she sped.Sin in her thoughts, her soul aflame,Where Queen Kaikeyí slept, she came:\"Why sleepest thou?\" she cried, \"arise,Peril is near, unclose thine eyes.Ah, heedless Queen, too blind to knowWhat floods of sin above thee flow!Thy boasts of love and grace are o\\'er:Thine is the show and nothing more.His favour is an empty cheat,A torrent dried by summer heat.\"Thus by the artful maid addressedIn cruel words from raging breast,The queen, sore troubled, spoke in turn;\"What evil news have I to learn?That mournful eye, that altered cheekOf sudden woe or danger speak.\"Such were the words Kaikeyí said:Then Manthará, her eyeballs redWith fury, skilled with treacherous artTo grieve yet more her lady heart,From Ráma, in her wicked hate,Kaikeyí love to alienate,Upon her evil purpose bentBegan again most eloquent:\"Peril awaits thee swift and sure,And utter woe defying cure;King Dasaratha will createPrince Ráma Heir Associate.Plunged in the depths of wild despair,My soul a prey to pain and care,As though the flames consumed me, zealHas brought me for my lady weal,Thy grief, my Queen, is grief to me:Thy gain my greatest gain would be.Proud daughter of a princely line,The rights of consort queen are thine.How art thou, born of royal race,Blind to the crimes that kings debase?Thy lord is gracious, to deceive,And flatters, but thy soul to grieve,While thy pure heart that thinks no sinKnows not the snares that hem thee in.Thy husband lips on thee bestowSoft soothing word, an empty show:The wealth, the substance, and the powerThis day will be Kausalyá dower.With crafty soul thy child he sendsTo dwell among thy distant friends,And, every rival far from sight,To Ráma gives the power and might.Ah me! for thou, unhappy dame,Deluded by a husband name,With more than mother love hast pressedA serpent to thy heedless breast,And cherished him who works thee woe,No husband but a deadly foe.For like a snake, unconscious Queen,Or enemy who stabs unseen,King Dasaratha all untrueHas dealt with thee and Bharat too.Ah, simple lady, long beguiledBy his soft words who falsely smiled!Poor victim of the guileless breast,A happier fate thou meritest.For thee and thine destruction waitsWhen he Prince Ráma consecrates.Up, lady, while there yet is time;Preserve thyself, prevent the crime.Up, from thy careless ease, and freeThyself, O Queen, thy son, and me!\"Delighted at the words she said,Kaikeyí lifted from the bed,Like autumn moon, her radiant head,And joyous at the tidings gaveA jewel to the hump-back slave;And as she gave the precious toyShe cried in her exceeding joy:\"Take this, dear maiden, for thy newsMost grateful to mine ear, and chooseWhat grace beside most fitly mayThe welcome messenger repay.I joy that Ráma gains the throne:Kausalyá son is as mine own.\"Canto VIII. Manthará Speech.The damsel breast with fury burned:She answered, as the gift she spurned:\"What time, O simple Queen, is thisFor idle dreams of fancied bliss?Hast thou not sense thy state to know,Engulfed in seas of whelming woe;Sick as I am with grief and painMy lips can scarce a laugh restrainTo see thee hail with ill-timed joyA peril mighty to destroy.I mourn for one so fondly blind:What woman of a prudent mindWould welcome, e\\'en as thou hast done,The lordship of a rival son,Rejoiced to find her secret foeEmpowered, like death, to launch the blow;I see that Ráma still must fearThy Bharat, to his throne too near.Hence is my heart disquieted,For those who fear are those we dread.Lakshman, the mighty bow who draws,With all his soul serves Ráma cause;And chains as strong to Bharat bindSatrughna, with his heart and mind,Now next to Ráma, lady fair,Thy Bharat is the lawful heir:And far remote, I ween, the chanceThat might the younger two advance.Yes, Queen, \\'tis Ráma that I dread,Wise, prompt, in warlike science bred;And oh, I tremble when I thinkOf thy dear child on ruin brink.Blest with a lofty fate is she,Kausalyá; for her son will bePlaced, when the moon and Pushya meet,By Bráhmans on the royal seat,Thou as a slave in suppliant guiseMust wait upon Kausalyá eyes,With all her wealth and bliss securedAnd glorious from her foes assured.Her slave with us who serve thee, thouWilt see thy son to Ráma bow,And Sítá friends exult o\\'er all,While Bharat wife shares Bharat fall.\"As thus the maid in wrath complained,Kaikeyí saw her heart was pained,And answered eager in defenceOf Ráma worth and excellence:\"Nay, Ráma, born the monarch heir,By holy fathers trained with care,Virtuous, grateful, pure, and true,Claims royal sway as rightly due.He, like a sire, will long defendEach brother, minister, and friend.Then why, O hump-back, art thou painedTo hear that he the throne has gained?Be sure when Ráma empire ends,The kingdom to my son descends,Who, when a hundred years are flown,Shall sit upon his fathers\\' throne.Why is thine heart thus sad to seeThe joy that is and long shall be,This fortune by possession sureAnd hopes which we may count secure?Dear as the darling son I boreIs Ráma, yea, or even more.Most duteous to Kausalyá, heIs yet more dutiful to me.What though he rule, we need not fear:His brethren to his soul are dear.And if the throne Prince Ráma fillBharat will share the empire still.\"She ceased. The troubled damsel sighedSighs long and hot, and thus replied:\"What madness has possessed thy mind,To warnings deaf, to dangers blind?Canst thou not see the floods of woeThat threaten o\\'er thine head to flow:First Ráma will the throne acquire,Then Ráma son succeed his sire,While Bharat will neglected pineExcluded from the royal line.Not all his sons, O lady fair,The kingdom of a monarch share:All ruling when a sovereign diesWild tumult in the state would rise.The eldest, be he good or ill,Is ruler by the father will.Know, tender mother, that thy sonWithout a friend and all undone,Far from the joyous ease of homeAn alien from his race will roam.I sped to thee for whom I feel,But thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,Thy hand a present would bestowBecause thy rival triumphs so.When Ráma once begins his swayWithout a foe his will to stay,Thy darling Bharat he will driveTo distant lands if left alive.By thee the child was sent awayBeneath his grandsire roof to stay.Even in stocks and stones perforceWill friendship spring from intercourse.The young Satrughna too would goWith Bharat, for he loved him so.As Lakshman still to Ráma cleaves,He his dear Bharat never leaves.There is an ancient tale they tell:A tree the foresters would fellWas saved by reeds that round it stood,For love that sprang of neighbourhood.So Lakshman Ráma will defend,And each on each for aid depend.Such fame on earth their friendship winsAs that which binds the Heavenly Twins.And Ráma ne\\'er will purpose wrongTo Lakshman, for their love is strong.But Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,Must evil at his hands endure.Come, Ráma from his home expelAn exile in the woods to dwell.The plan, O Queen, which I adviseSecures thy weal if thou be wise.So we and all thy kith and kinAdvantage from thy gain shall win.Shall Bharat, meet for happier fate,Born to endure his rival hate,With all his fortune ruined cowerAnd dread his brother mightier power!Up, Queen, to save thy son, arise;Prostrate at Ráma feet he lies.So the proud elephant who leadsHis trooping consorts through the reedsFalls in the forest shade beneathThe lion spring and murderous teeth.Scorned by thee in thy bliss and prideKausalyá was of old defied,And will she now forbear to showThe vengeful rancour of a foe?O Queen, thy darling is undoneWhen Ráma hand has once begunAyodhyá realm to sway,Come, win the kingdom for thy childAnd drive the alien to the wildIn banishment to-day.\"Canto IX. The Plot.As fury lit Kaikeyí eyesShe spoke with long and burning sighs:\"This day my son enthroned shall see,And Ráma to the woods shall flee.But tell me, damsel, if thou can,A certain way, a skilful planThat Bharat may the empire gain,And Ráma hopes be nursed in vain.\"The lady ceased. The wicked maidThe mandate of her queen obeyed,And darkly plotting Ráma fallResponded to Kaikeyí call.\"I will declare, do thou attend,How Bharat may his throne ascend.Dost thou forget what things befell?Or dost thou feign, remembering well?Or wouldst thou hear my tongue repeatA story for thy need so meet?Gay lady, if thy will be so,Now hear the tale of long ago,And when my tongue has done its partPonder the story in thine heart.When Gods and demons fought of old,Thy lord, with royal saints enrolled,Sped to the war with thee to bringHis might to aid the Immortals\\' King.Far to the southern land he spedWhere Dandak mighty wilds are spread,To Vaijayanta city swayedBy Sambara, whose flag displaydThe hugest monster of the sea.Lord of a hundred wiles was be;With might which Gods could never blameAgainst the King of Heaven he came.Then raged the battle wild and dread,And mortal warriors fought and bled;The fiends by night with strength renewedCharged, slew the sleeping multitude.Thy lord, King Dasaratha, longStood fighting with the demon throng,But long of arm, unmatched in strength,Fell wounded by their darts at length.Thy husband, senseless, by thine aidWas from the battle field conveyed,And wounded nigh to death thy lordWas by thy care to health restored.Well pleased the grateful monarch swareTo grant thy first and second prayer.Thou for no favour then wouldst sue,The gifts reserved for season due;And he, thy high-souled lord, agreedTo give the boons when thou shouldst need.Myself I knew not what befell,But oft the tale have heard thee tell,And close to thee in friendship knitDeep in my heart have treasured it.Remind thy husband of his oath,Recall the boons and claim them both,That Bharat on the throne be placedWith rites of consecration graced,And Ráma to the woods be sentFor twice seven years of banishment.Go, Queen, the mourner chamber(270) seek,With angry eye and burning cheek;And with disordered robes and hairOn the cold earth lie prostrate there.When the king comes still mournful lie,Speak not a word nor meet his eye,But let thy tears in torrent flow,And lie enamoured of thy woe.Well do I know thou long hast been,And ever art, his darling queen.For thy dear sake, O well-loved dame,The mighty king would brave the flame,But ne\\'er would anger thee, or brookTo meet his favourite wrathful look.Thy loving lord would even dieThy fancy, Queen, to gratify,And never could he arm his breastTo answer nay to thy request.Listen and learn, O dull of sense,Thine all-resistless influence.Gems he will offer, pearls and gold:Refuse his gifts, be stern and cold.Those proffered boons at length recall,And claim them till he grants thee all.And O my lady, high in bliss,With heedful thought forget not this.When from the ground his queen he liftsAnd grants again the promised gifts,Bind him with oaths he cannot breakAnd thy demands unflnching, make.That Ráma travel to the wildFive years and nine from home exiled,And Bharat, best of all who reign,The empire of the land obtain.For when this term of years has fledOver the banished Ráma head,Thy royal son to vigour grownAnd rooted firm will stand alone.The king, I know, is well inclined,And this the hour to move his mind.Be bold: the threatened rite prevent,And force the king from his intent.\"She ceased. So counselled to her baneDisguised beneath a show of gain,Kaikeyí in her joy and prideTo Manthará again replied:\"Thy sense I envy, prudent maid;With sagest lore thy lids persuade.No hump-back maid in all the earth,For wise resolve, can match thy worth.Thou art alone with constant zealDevoted to thy lady weal.Dear girl, without thy faithful aidI had not marked the plot he laid.Full of all guile and sin and spiteMisshapen hump-backs shock the sight:But thou art fair and formed to please,Bent like a lily by the breeze.I look thee o\\'er with watchful eye,And in thy frame no fault can spy;The chest so deep, the waist so trim,So round the lines of breast and limb.(271)Thy cheeks with moonlike beauty shine,And the warm wealth of youth is thine.Thy legs, my girl, are long and neat,And somewhat long thy dainty feet,While stepping out before my faceThou seemest like a crane to pace.The thousand wiles are in thy breastWhich Sambara the fiend possessed,And countless others all thine own,O damsel sage, to thee are known.Thy very hump becomes thee too,O thou whose face is fair to view,For there reside in endless storePlots, wizard wiles, and warrior lore.A golden chain I\\'ll round it flingWhen Ráma flight makes Bharat king:Yea, polished links of finest gold,When once the wished for prize I holdWith naught to fear and none to hate,Thy hump, dear maid, shall decorate.A golden frontlet wrought with care,And precious jewels shalt thou wear:Two lovely robes around thee fold,And walk a Goddess to behold,Bidding the moon himself compareHis beauty with a face so fair.With scent of precious sandal sweetDown to the nails upon thy feet,First of the household thou shalt goAnd pay with scorn each battled foe.\"Kaikeyí praise the damsel heard,And thus again her lady stirred,Who lay upon her beauteous bedLike fire upon the altar fed:\"Dear Queen, they build the bridge in vainWhen swollen streams are dry again.Arise, thy glorious task complete,And draw the king to thy retreat.\"The large-eyed lady left her bowerExulting in her pride of power,And with the hump-back sought the gloomAnd silence of the mourner room.The string of priceless pearls that hungAround her neck to earth she flung,With all the wealth and lustre lentBy precious gem and ornament.Then, listening to her slave advice,Lay, like a nymph from Paradise.As on the ground her limbs she laidOnce more she cried unto the maid:\"Soon must thou to the monarch sayKaikeyí soul has past away,Or, Ráma banished as we planned,My son made king shall rule the land.No more for gold and gems I care,For brave attire or dainty fare.If Ráma should the throne ascend,That very hour my life will end.\"The royal lady wounded throughThe bosom with the darts that flewLaunched from the hump-back tonguePressed both her hands upon her side,And o\\'er and o\\'er again she criedWith wildering fury stung:\"Yes, it shall be thy task to tellThat I have hurried hence to dwellIn Yáma realms of woe,Or happy Bharat shall be king,And doomed to years of wanderingKausalyá son shall go.I heed not dainty viands nowFair wreaths of flowers to twine my brow,Soft balm or precious scent:My very life I count as naught,Nothing on earth can claim my thoughtBut Ráma banishment.\"She spoke these words of cruel ire;Then stripping off her gay attire,The cold bare floor she pressed.So, falling from her home on high,Some lovely daughter of the skyUpon the ground might rest.With darkened brow and furious mien,Stripped of her gems and wreath, the queenIn spotless beauty lay,Like heaven obscured with gathering cloud,When shades of midnight darkness shroudEach star expiring ray.Canto X. Dasaratha Speech.As Queen Kaikeyí thus obeyedThe sinful counsel of her maidShe sank upon the chamber floor,As sinks in anguish, wounded sore,An elephant beneath the smartOf the wild hunter venomed dart.The lovely lady in her mindRevolved the plot her maid designed,And prompt the gain and risk to scanShe step by step approved the plan.Misguided by the hump-back guileShe pondered her resolve awhile,As the fair path that bliss securedThe miserable lady lured,Devoted to her queen, and swayedBy hopes of gain and bliss, the maidRejoiced, her lady purpose known,And deemed the prize she sought her own.Then bent upon her purpose dire,Kaikeyí with her soul on fire,Upon the floor lay, languid, down,Her brows contracted in a frown.The bright-hued wreath that bound her hair,Chains, necklets, jewels rich and rare,Stripped off by her own fingers laySpread on the ground in disarray,And to the floor a lustre lentAs stars light up the firmament.Thus prostrate in the mourner cell,In garb of woe the lady fell,Her long hair in a single braid,Like some fair nymph of heaven dismayed.(272)The monarch, Ráma to install,With thoughtful care had ordered all,And now within his home withdrew,Dismissing first his retinue.Now all the town has heard, thought he,What joyful rite the morn will see.So turned he to her bower to cheerWith the glad news his darling ear.Majestic, as the Lord of Night,When threatened by the Dragon might,Bursts radiant on the evening skyPale with the clouds that wander by,So Dasaratha, great in fame,To Queen Kaikeyí palace came.There parrots flew from tree to tree,And gorgeous peacocks wandered free,While ever and anon was heardThe note of some glad water-bird.Here loitered dwarf and hump-backed maid,There lute and lyre sweet music played.Here, rich in blossom, creepers twinedO\\'er grots with wondrous art designed,There Champac and Asoka flowersHung glorious o\\'er the summer bowers,And mid the waving verdure roseGold, silver, ivory porticoes.Through all the months in ceaseless storeThe trees both fruit and blossom bore.With many a lake the grounds were graced;Seats gold and silver, here were placed;Here every viand wooed the taste,It was a garden meet to vieE\\'en with the home of Gods on high.Within the mansion rich and vastThe mighty Dasaratha passed:Not there was his beloved queenOn her fair couch reclining seen.With love his eager pulses beatFor the dear wife he came to meet,And in his blissful hopes deceived,He sought his absent love and grieved.For never had she missed the hourOf meeting in her sumptuous bower,And never had the king of menEntered the empty room till then.Still urged by love and anxious thoughtNews of his favourite queen he sought,For never had his loving eyesFound her or selfish or unwise.Then spoke at length the warder maid,With hands upraised and sore afraid:\"My Lord and King, the queen has soughtThe mourner cell with rage distraught.\"The words the warder maiden saidHe heard with soul disquieted,And thus as fiercer grief assailed,His troubled senses wellnigh failed.Consumed by torturing fires of griefThe king, the world imperial chief,His lady lying on the groundIn most unqueenly posture, found.The aged king, all pure within,Saw the young queen resolved on sin,Low on the ground, his own sweet wife,To him far dearer than his life,Like some fair creeping plant uptorn,Or like a maid of heaven forlorn,A nymph of air or Goddess sentFrom Swarga down in banishment.As some wild elephant who triesTo soothe his consort as she liesStruck by the hunter venomed dart,So the great king disturbed in heart,Strove with soft hand and fond caressTo soothe his darling queen distress,And in his love addressed with sighsThe lady of the lotus eyes:\"I know not, Queen, why thou shouldst beThus angered to the heart with me.Say, who has slighted thee, or whenceHas come the cause of such offenceThat in the dust thou liest low,And rendest my fond heart with woe,As if some goblin of the nightHad struck thee with a deadly blight,And cast foul influence on herWhose spells my loving bosom stir?I have Physicians famed for skill,Each trained to cure some special ill:My sweetest lady, tell thy pain,And they shall make thee well again.Whom, darling, wouldst thou punished see?Or whom enriched with lordly fee?Weep not, my lovely Queen, and stayThis grief that wears thy frame away;Speak, and the guilty shall be freed.The guiltless be condemned to bleed,The poor enriched, the rich abased,The low set high, the proud disgraced.My lords and I thy will obey,All slaves who own thy sovereign sway;And I can ne\\'er my heart inclineTo check in aught one wish of thine.Now by my life I pray thee tellThe thoughts that in thy bosom dwell.The power and might thou knowest well,Should from thy breast all doubt expel.I swear by all my merit won,Speak, and thy pleasure shall be done.Far as the world wide bounds extendMy glorious empire knows no end.Mine are the tribes in eastern lands,And those who dwell on Sindhu sands:Mine is Suráshtra, far away,Suvíra realm admits my sway.My best the southern nations fear,The Angas and the Vangas hear.And as lord paramount I reignO\\'er Magadh and the Matsyas\\' plain,Kosal, and Kási wide domain:(273)All rich in treasures of the mine,In golden corn, sheep, goats, and kine.Choose what thou wilt. Kaikeyí, thence:But tell me, O my darling, whenceArose thy grief, and it shall flyLike hoar-frost when the sun is high.\"She, by his loving words consoled,Longed her dire purpose to unfold,And sought with sharper pangs to wringThe bosom of her lord the king.Canto XI. The Queen Demand.To him enthralled by love, and blind,Pierced by his darts who shakes the mind,(274)Kaikeyí with remorseless breastHer grand purpose thus expressed:\"O King, no insult or neglectHave I endured, or disrespect.One wish I have, and faith would seeThat longing granted, lord, by thee.Now pledge thy word if thou inclineTo listen to this prayer of mine,Then I with confidence will speak,And thou shalt hear the boon I seek.\"Ere she had ceased, the monarch fell,A victim to the lady spell,And to the deadly snare she setSprang, like a roebuck to the net.Her lover raised her drooping head,Smiled, playing with her hair, and said:\"Hast thou not learnt, wild dame, till nowThat there is none so dear as thouTo me thy loving husband, saveMy Ráma bravest of the brave?By him my race high-souled heir,By him whom none can match, I swear,Now speak the wish that on thee weighs:By him whose right is length of days,Whom if my fond paternal eyeSaw not one hour I needs must die,--I swear by Ráma my dear son,Speak, and thy bidding shall be done.Speak, darling; if thou choose, requestTo have the heart from out my breast;Regard my words, sweet love, and nameThe wish thy mind thinks fit to frame.Nor let thy soul give way to doubt:My power should drive suspicion out.Yea, by my merits won I swear,Speak, darling, I will grant thy prayer.\"The queen, ambitious, overjoyedTo see him by her plot decoyed,More eager still her aims to reach,Spoke her abominable speech:\"A boon thou grantest, nothing loth,And swearest with repeated oath.Now let the thirty Gods and threeMy witnesses, with Indra, be.Let sun and moon and planets hear,Heaven, quarters, day and night, give ear.The mighty world, the earth outspread,With bards of heaven and demons dread;The ghosts that walk in midnight shade,And household Gods, our present aid,A every being great and smallTo hear and mark the oath I call.\"When thus the archer king was bound,With treacherous arts and oaths enwound,She to her bounteous lord subduedBy blinding love, her speech renewed:\"Remember, King, that long-past dayOf Gods\\' and demons\\' battle fray.And how thy foe in doubtful strifeHad nigh bereft thee of thy life.Remember, it was only IPreserved thee when about to die,And thou for watchful love and careWouldst grant my first and second prayer.Those offered boons, pledged with thee then,I now demand, O King of men,Of thee, O Monarch, good and just,Whose righteous soul observes each trust.If thou refuse thy promise sworn,I die, despised, before the morn.These rites in Ráma name begun--Transfer them, and enthrone my son.The time is come to claim at lastThe double boon of days long-past,When Gods and demons met in fight,And thou wouldst fain my care requite.Now forth to Dandak forest driveThy Ráma for nine years and five,And let him dwell a hermit thereWith deerskin coat and matted hair.Without a rival let my boyThe empire of the land enjoy,And let mine eyes ere morning seeThy Ráma to the forest flee.\"Canto XII. Dasaratha Lament.The monarch, as Kaikeyí pressedWith cruel words her dire request,Stood for a time absorbed in thoughtWhile anguish in his bosom wrought.\"Does some wild dream my heart assail?Or do my troubled senses fail?Does some dire portent scare my view?Or frenzy stroke my soul subdue?\"Thus as he thought, his troubled mindIn doubt and dread no rest could find,Distressed and trembling like a deerWho sees the dreaded tigress near.On the bare ground his limbs he threw,And many a long deep sigh he drew,Like a wild snake, with fury blind,By charms within a ring confined.Once as the monarch fury woke,\"Shame on thee!\" from his bosom broke,And then in sense-bewildering painHe fainted on the ground again.At length, when slowly strength returned,He answered as his eyeballs burnedWith the wild fury of his ireConsuming her, as \\'twere, with fire:\"Fell traitress, thou whose thoughts designThe utter ruin of my line,What wrong have I or Ráma done?Speak murderess, speak thou wicked one,Seeks he not evermore to pleaseThee with all sonlike courtesies?By what persuasion art thou ledTo bring this ruin on his head?Ah me, that fondly unawareI brought thee home my life to share,Called daughter of a king, in truthA serpent with a venomed tooth!What fault can I pretend to findIn Ráma praised by all mankind,That I my darling should forsake?No, take my life, my glory take:Let either queen be from me torn,But not my well-loved eldest-born.Him but to see is highest bliss,And death itself his face to miss.The world may sunless stand, the grainMay thrive without the genial rain,But if my Ráma be not nighMy spirit from its frame will fly.Enough, thine impious plan forgo,O thou who plottest sin and woe.My head before thy feet, I kneel,And pray thee some compassion feel.O wicked dame, what can have ledThy heart to dare a plot so dread?Perchance thy purpose is to soundThe grace thy son with me has found;Perchance the words that, all these days,Thou still hast said in Ráma praise,Were only feigned, designed to cheerWith flatteries a father ear.Soon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,My bosom felt the anguish too.In empty halls art thou possessed,And subject to anothers\\' hest?Now on Ikshváku ancient raceFalls foul disorder and disgrace,If thou, O Queen, whose heart so longHas loved the good should choose the wrong.Not once, O large-eyed dame, hast thouBeen guilty of offence till now,Nor said a word to make me grieve,Now will I now thy sin believe.With thee my Ráma used to holdLike place with Bharat lofty-souled.As thou so often, when the pairWere children yet, wouldst fain declare.And can thy righteous soul endureThat Ráma glorious, pious, pure,Should to the distant wilds be sentFor fourteen years of banishment?Yea, Ráma Bharat self exceedsIn love to thee and sonlike deeds,And, for deserving love of thee,As Bharat, even so is he.Who better than that chieftain mayObedience, love, and honour pay,Thy dignity with care protect,Thy slightest word and wish respect?Of all his countless followers noneCan breathe a word against my son;Of many thousands not a dameCan hint reproach or whisper blame.All creatures feel the sweet controlOf Ráma pure and gentle soul.The pride of Manu race he bindsTo him the people grateful minds.He wins the subjects with his truth,The poor with gifts and gentle ruth,His teachers with his docile will,The foemen with his archer skill.Truth, purity, religious zeal,The hand to give, the heart to feel,The love that ne\\'er betrays a friend,The rectitude that naught can bend,Knowledge, and meek obedience graceMy Ráma pride of Raghu race.Canst thou thine impious plot design\\'Gainst him in whom these virtues shine,Whose glory with the sages vies,Peer of the Gods who rule the skies!From him no harsh or bitter wordTo pain one creature have I heard,And how can I my son address,For thee, with words of bitterness?Have mercy, Queen: some pity showTo see my tears of anguish flow,And listen to my mournful cry,A poor old man who soon must die.Whate\\'er this sea-girt land can boastOf rich and rare from coast to coast,To thee, my Queen, I give it all:But O, thy deadly words recall:O see, my suppliant hands entreat,Again my lips are on thy feet:Save Ráma, save my darling child,Nor kill me with this sin defiled.\"He grovelled on the ground, and layTo burning grief a senseless prey,And ever and anon, assailedBy floods of woe he wept and wailed,Striving with eager speed to gainThe margent of his sea of pain.With fiercer words she fiercer yetThe hapless father pleading met:\"O Monarch, if thy soul repentThe promise and thy free consent,How wilt thou in the world maintainThy fame for truth unsmirched with stain?When gathered kings with thee converse,And bid thee all the tale rehearse,What wilt thou say, O truthful King,In answer to their questioning?\"She to whose love my life I owe,Who saved me smitten by the foe,Kaikeyí, for her tender care,Was cheated of the oath I sware.\"Thus wilt thou answer, and forswornWilt draw on thee the princes\\' scorn.Learn from that tale, the Hawk and Dove,(275)How strong for truth was Saivya love.Pledged by his word the monarch gaveHis flesh the suppliant bird to save.So King Alarka gave his eyes,And gained a mansion in the skies.The Sea himself his promise keeps,And ne\\'er beyond his limit sweeps.My deeds of old again recall,Nor let thy bond dishonoured fall.The rights of truth thou wouldst forget,Thy Ráma on the throne to set,And let thy days in pleasure glide,Fond King, Kausalyá by thy side.Now call it by what name thou wilt,Justice, injustice, virtue, guilt,Thy word and oath remain the same,And thou must yield what thus I claim.If Ráma be anointed, IThis very day will surely die,Before thy face will poison drink,And lifeless at thy feet will sink.Yea, better far to die than stayAlive to see one single dayThe crowds before Kausalyá standAnd hail her queen with reverent hand.Now by my son, myself, I swear,No gift, no promise whatsoe\\'erMy steadfast soul shall now content,But only Ráma banishment.\"So far she spake by rage impelled,And then the queen deep silence held.He heard her speech full fraught with ill,But spoke no word bewildered still,Gazed on his love once held so dearWho spoke unlovely rede to hear;Then as he slowly pondered o\\'erThe queen resolve and oath she swore.Once sighing forth, Ah Ráma! heFell prone as falls a smitten tree.His senses lost like one insane,Faint as a sick man weak with pain,Or like a wounded snake dismayed,So lay the king whom earth obeyed.Long burning sighs he slowly heaved,As, conquered by his woe, he grieved,And thus with tears and sobs betweenHis sad faint words addressed the queen:\"By whom, Kaikeyí, wast thou taughtThis flattering hope with ruin fraught?Have goblins seized thy soul, O dame,Who thus canst speak and feel no shame?Thy mind with sin is sicklied o\\'er,From thy first youth ne\\'er seen before.A good and loving wife wast thou,But all, alas! is altered now.What terror can have seized thy breastTo make thee frame this dire request,That Bharat o\\'er the land may reign,And Ráma in the woods remain?Turn from thine evil ways, O turn,And thy perfidious counsel spurn,If thou would fain a favour doTo people, lord, and Bharat too.O wicked traitress, fierce and vile,Who lovest deeds of sin and guile,What crime or grievance dost thou see,What fault in Ráma or in me?Thy son will ne\\'er the throne acceptIf Ráma from his rights be kept,For Bharat heart more firmly yetThan Ráma is on justice set.How shall I say, Go forth, and brookUpon my Ráma face to look,See his pale cheek and ashy lipsDimmed like the moon in sad eclipse?How see the plan so well preparedWhen prudent friends my counsels shared,All ruined, like a host laid lowBeneath some foeman murderous blow.What will these gathered princes say,From regions near and far away?\"O\\'erlong endures the monarch reign,or now he is a child again.\"When many a good and holy sageIn Scripture versed, revered for age,Shall ask for Ráma, what shall IUnhappy, what shall I reply?\"By Queen Kaikeyí long distressedI drove him forth and dispossessed.\"Although herein the truth I speak,They all will hold me false and weak.What will Kausalyá say when sheDemands her son exiled by me?Alas! what answer shall I frame,Or how console the injured dame?She like a slave on me attends,And with a sister care she blendsA mother love, a wife, a friend.In spite of all her tender care,Her noble son, her face most fair,Another queen I could preferAnd for thy sake neglected her,But now, O Queen, my heart is grievedFor love and care by thee received,E\\'en as the sickening wretch repentsHis dainty meal and condiments.And how will Queen Sumitrá trustThe husband whom she finds unjust,Seeing my Ráma driven henceDishonoured, and for no offence?Ah! the Videhan bride will hearA double woe, a double fear,Two whelming sorrows at one breath,Her lord disgrace, his father death.Mine aged bosom she will wringAnd kill me with her sorrowing,Sad as a fair nymph left to weepDeserted on Himálaya steep.For short will be my days, I ween,When I with mournful eyes have seenMy Ráma wandering forth aloneAnd heard dear Sítá sob and moan.Ah me! my fond belief I rue.Vile traitress, loved as good and true,As one who in his thirst has quaffed,Deceived by looks, a deadly draught.Ah! thou hast slain me, murderess, whileSoothing my soul with words of guile,As the wild hunter kills the deerLured from the brake his song to hear.Soon every honest tongue will flingReproach on the dishonest king;The people scorn in every streetThe seller of his child will meet,And such dishonour will be mineAs whelms a Bráhman drunk with wine.Ah me, for my unhappy fate,Compelled thy words to tolerate!Such woe is sent to scourge a crimeCommitted in some distant time.For many a day with sinful careI cherished thee, thou sin and snare,Kept thee, unwitting, like a cordDestined to bind its hapless lord.Mine hours of ease I spent with thee,Nor deemed my love my death would be,While like a heedless child I played,On a black snake my hand I laid.A cry from every mouth will burstAnd all the world will hold me curst,Because I saw my high-souled sonUnkinged, unfathered, and undone;\"The king by power of love beguiledIs weaker than a foolish child,His own beloved son to makeAn exile for a woman sake.By chaste and holy vows restrained,By reverend teachers duly trained.When he his virtue fruit should tasteHe falls by sin and woe disgraced.\"Two words will all his answer beWhen I pronounce the stern decree,\"Hence, Ráma, to the woods away,\"All he will say is, I obey.O, if he would my will withstandWhen banished from his home and land,This were a comfort in my woe;But he will ne\\'er do this, I know.My Ráma to the forest fled,And curses thick upon my head,Grim Death will bear me hence away,His world-abominated prey.When I am gone and Ráma too.How wilt thou those I love pursue?What vengeful sin will be designedAgainst the queens I leave behind?When thou hast slain her son and meKausalyá soon will follow: sheWill sink beneath her sorrows\\' weight,And die like me disconsolate.Exist, Kaikeyí, in thy pride,And let thy heart be gratified,When thou my queens and me hast hurled,And children, to the under world.Soon wilt thou rule as empress o\\'erMy noble house unvext before.But then to wild confusion left,Of Ráma and of me bereft.If Bharat to thy plan consentAnd long for Ráma banishment,Ne\\'er let his hands presume to payThe funeral honours to my clay.Vile foe, thou cause of all mine ill,Obtain at last thy cursed will.A widow soon shalt thou enjoyThe sweets of empire with thy boy.O Princess, sure some evil fateFirst brought thee here to devastate,In whom the night of ruin liesVeiled in a consort fair disguise.The scorn of all and deepest shameWill long pursue my hated name,And dire disgrace on me will press,Misled by thee to wickedness.How shall my Ráma, whom, before,His elephant or chariot bore,Now with his feet, a wanderer, treadThe forest wilds around him spread?How shall my son, to please whose taste,The deftest cooks, with earrings graced,With rivalry and jealous careThe dainty meal and cates prepare--How shall he now his life sustainWith acid fruit and woodland grain?He spends his time unvext by cares,And robes of precious texture wears:How shall he, with one garment roundHis limbs recline upon the ground?Whose was this plan, this cruel thoughtUnheard till now, with ruin fraught,To make thy son Ayodhyá king,And send my Ráma wandering?Shame, shame on women! Vile, untrue,Their selfish ends they still pursue.Not all of womankind I mean.But more than all this wicked queen.O worthless, cruel, selfish dame,I brought thee home, my plague and woe.What fault in me hast thou to blame,Or in my son who loves thee so?Fond wives may from their husbands flee,And fathers may their sons desert,But all the world would rave to seeMy Ráma touched with deadly hurt.I joy his very step to hear,As though his godlike form I viewed;And when I see my Ráma nearI feel my youth again renewed.There might be life without the sun,Yea, e\\'en if Indra sent no rain,But, were my Ráma banished, noneWould, so I think, alive remain.A foe that longs my life to take,I brought thee here my death to be,Caressed thee long, a venomed snake,And through my folly die. Ah me!Ráma and me and Lakshman slay,And then with Bharat rule the state;So bring the kingdom to decay,And fawn on those thy lord who hate,Plotter of woe, for evil bred,For such a speech why do not allThy teeth from out thy wicked headSplit in a thousand pieces fall?My Ráma words are ever kind,He knows not how to speak in ire:Then how canst thou presume to findA fault in him whom all admire?Yield to despair, go mad, or die,Or sink within the rifted earth;Thy fell request will I deny,Thou shamer of thy royal birth.Thy longer life I scarce can bear,Thou ruin of my home and race,Who wouldst my heart and heartstrings tear,Keen as a razor, false and base.My life is gone, why speak of joy?For what, without my son, were sweet?Spare, lady, him thou canst destroy;I pray thee as I touch thy feet.\"He fell and wept with wild complaint,Heart-struck by her presumptuous speech,But could not touch, so weak and faint,The cruel feet he strove to reach.Canto XIII. Dasaratha Distress.Unworthy of his mournful fate,The mighty king, unfortunate,Lay prostrate in unseemly guise,As, banished from the blissful skies,Yayáti, in his evil day.His merit all exhausted, lay.(276)The queen, triumphant in the powerWon by her beauty fatal dower,Still terrible and unsubdued,Her dire demand again renewed:\"Great Monarch, \\'twas thy boast till nowTo love the truth and keep the vow;Then wherefore would thy lips refuseThe promised boon \\'tis mine to choose?\"King Dasaratha, thus addressed,With anger raging in his breast,Sank for a while beneath the pain,Then to Kaikeyí spoke again:\"Childless so long, at length I won,With mighty toil, from Heaven a son,Ráma, the mighty-armed; and howShall I desert my darling now?A scholar wise, a hero bold,Of patient mood, with wrath controlled,How can I bid my Ráma fly,My darling of the lotus eye?In heaven itself I scarce could bear,When asking of my Ráma there,To hear the Gods his griefs declare,And O, that death would take me henceBefore I wrong his innocence!\"As thus the monarch wept and wailed,And maddening grief his heart assailed,The sun had sought his resting-place,And night was closing round apace.But yet the moon-crowned night could bringNo comfort to the wretched king.As still he mourned with burning sighsAnd fixed his gaze upon the skies:\"O Night whom starry fires adorn,I long not for the coming morn.Be kind and show some mercy: see,My suppliant hands are raised to thee.Nay, rather fly with swifter pace;No longer would I see the faceOf Queen Kaikeyí, cruel, dread,Who brings this woe upon mine head.\"Again with suppliant hands he triedTo move the queen, and wept and sighed:\"To me, unhappy me, inclinedTo good, sweet dame, thou shouldst be kind;Whose life is well-nigh fled, who clingTo thee for succour, me thy king.This, only this, is all my claim:Have mercy, O my lovely dame.None else have I to take my part,Have mercy: thou art good at heart.Hear, lady of the soft black eye,And win a name that ne\\'er shall die:Let Ráma rule this glorious land,The gift of thine imperial hand.O lady of the dainty waist,With eyes and lips of beauty graced,Please Ráma, me, each saintly priest,Bharat, and all from chief to least.\"She heard his wild and mournful cry,She saw the tears his speech that broke,Saw her good husband reddened eye,But, cruel still, no word she spoke.His eyes upon her face he bent,And sought for mercy, but in vain:She claimed his darling banishment,He swooned upon the ground again.Canto XIV. Ráma Summoned.The wicked queen her speech renewed,When rolling on the earth she viewedIkshváku son, Ayodhyá king,For his dear Ráma sorrowing:\"Why, by a simple promise bound,Liest thou prostrate on the ground,As though a grievous sin dismayedThy spirit! Why so sore afraid?Keep still thy word. The righteous deemThat truth, mid duties, is supreme:And now in truth and honour nameI bid thee own the binding claim.Saivya, a king whom earth obeyed,Once to a hawk a promise made,Gave to the bird his flesh and bone,And by his truth made heaven his own.(277)Alarka, when a Bráhman famedFor Scripture lore his promise claimed,Tore from his head his bleeding eyesAnd unreluctant gave the prize.His narrow bounds prescribed restrainThe Rivers\\' Lord, the mighty main,Who, though his waters boil and rave,Keeps faithful to the word he gave.Truth all religion comprehends,Through all the world its might extends:In truth alone is justice placed,On truth the words of God are based:A life in truth unchanging pastWill bring the highest bliss at last.If thou the right would still pursue,Be constant to thy word and true:Let me thy promise fruitful see,For boons, O King, proceed from thee.Now to preserve thy righteous fame,And yielding to my earnest claim--Thrice I repeat it--send thy child,Thy Ráma, to the forest wild.But if the boon thou still deny,Before thy face, forlorn, I die.\"Thus was the helpless monarch stungBy Queen Kaikeyí fearless tongue,As Bali strove in vain to looseHis limbs from Indra fatal noose.Dismayed in soul and pale with fear,The monarch, like a trembling steerBetween the chariot wheel and yoke,Again to Queen Kaikeyí spoke,With sad eyes fixt in vacant stare,Gathering courage from despair:\"That hand I took, thou sinful dame,With texts, before the sacred flame,Thee and thy son, I scorn and hate,And all at once repudiate.The night is fled: the dawn is near:Soon will the holy priests be hereTo bid me for the rite prepareThat with my son the throne will share,The preparation made to graceMy Ráma in his royal place--With this, e\\'en this, my darling forMy death the funeral flood shall pour.Thou and thy son at least forbearIn offerings to my shade to share,For by the plot thy guile has laidHis consecration will be stayed.This very day how shall I brookTo meet each subject altered look?To mark each gloomy joyless browThat was so bright and glad but now?\"While thus the high-souled monarch spokeTo the stern queen, the Morning broke,And holy night had slowly fled,With moon and stars engarlanded.Yet once again the cruel queenSpoke words in answer fierce and keen,Still on her evil purpose bent,Wild with her rage and eloquent:\"What speech is this? Such words as theseSeem sprung from poison-sown disease.Quick to thy noble Ráma sendAnd bid him on his sire attend.When to my son the rule is given;When Ráma to the woods is driven;When not a rival copes with me,From chains of duty thou art free.\"Thus goaded, like a generous steedUrged by sharp spurs to double speed,\"My senses are astray,\" he cried,\"And duty bonds my hands have tied.I long to see mine eldest son,My virtuous, my beloved one.\"And now the night had past away;Out shone the Maker of the Day,Bringing the planetary hourAnd moment of auspicious power.Vasishtha, virtuous, far renowned,Whose young disciples girt him round,With sacred things without delayThrough the fair city took his way.He traversed, where the people thronged,And all for Ráma coming longed,The town as fair in festive showAs his who lays proud cities low.(278)He reached the palace where he heardThe mingled notes of many a bird,Where crowded thick high-honoured bandsOf guards with truncheons in their hands.Begirt by many a sage, elate,Vasishtha reached the royal gate,And standing by the door he foundSumantra, for his form renowned,The king illustrious charioteerAnd noble counsellor and peer.To him well skilled in every partOf his hereditary artVasishtha said: \"O charioteer,Inform the king that I am here,Here ready by my side beholdThese sacred vessels made of gold,Which water for the rite containFrom Gangá and each distant main.Here for installing I have broughtThe seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,All kinds of seed and precious scentAnd many a gem and ornament;Grain, sacred grass, the garden spoil,Honey and curds and milk and oil;Eight radiant maids, the best of allWar elephants that feed in stall;A four-horse car, a bow and sword.A litter, men to bear their lord;A white umbrella bright and fairThat with the moon may well compare;Two chouries of the whitest hair;A golden beaker rich and rare;A bull high-humped and fair to view,Girt with gold bands and white of hue;A four-toothed steed with flowing mane,A throne which lions carved sustain;A tiger skin, the sacred fire,Fresh kindled, which the rites require;The best musicians skilled to play,And dancing-girls in raiment gay;Kine, Bráhmans, teachers fill the court,And bird and beast of purest sort.From town and village, far and near,The noblest men are gathered here;Here merchants with their followers crowd,And men in joyful converse loud,And kings from many a distant landTo view the consecration stand.The dawn is come, the lucky day;Go bid the monarch haste away,That now Prince Ráma may obtainThe empire, and begin his reign.\"Soon as he heard the high behestThe driver of the chariot pressedWithin the chambers of the king,His lord with praises honouring.And none of all the warders checkedHis entrance for their great respectOf him well known, in place so high,Still fain their king to gratify.He stood beside the royal chief,Unwitting of his deadly grief,And with sweet words began to singThe praises of his lord and king:\"As, when the sun begins to rise,The sparkling sea delights our eyes,Wake, calm with gentle soul, and thusGive rapture, mighty King, to us.As Mátali(279) this selfsame hourSang lauds of old to Indra power,When he the Titan hosts o\\'erthrew,So hymn I thee with praises due.The Vedas, with their kindred lore,Brahmá their soul-born Lord adore,With all the doctrines of the wise,And bid him, as I bid thee, rise.As, with the moon, the Lord of DayWakes with the splendour of his rayProlific Earth, who neath him lies,So, mighty King, I bid thee rise.With blissful words, O Lord of men,Rise, radiant in thy form, as whenThe sun ascending darts his lightFrom Meru everlasting height.May Siva, Agni, Sun, and MoonBestow on thee each choicest boon,Kuvera, Varuna, Indra blessKakutstha son with all success.Awake, the holy night is fled,The happy light abroad is spread;Awake, O best of kings, and shareThe glorious task that claims thy care.The holy sage Vasishtha waits,With all his Bráhmans, at the gate.Give thy decree, without delay,To consecrate thy son today.As armies, by no captain led,As flocks that feed unshepherded,Such is the fortune of a stateWithout a king and desolate.\"Such were the words the bard addressed,With weight of sage advice impressed;And, as he heard, the hapless kingFelt deeper yet his sorrow sting.At length, all joy and comfort fled,He raised his eyes with weeping red,And, mournful for his Ráma sake,The good and glorious monarch spake:\"Why seek with idle praise to greetThe wretch for whom no praise is meet?Thy words mine aching bosom tear,And plunge me deeper in despair.\"Sumantra heard the sad reply,And saw his master tearful eye.With reverent palm to palm appliedHe drew a little space aside.Then, as the king, with misery weak,With vain endeavour strove to speak,Kaikeyí, skilled in plot and plan,To sage Sumantra thus began:\"The king, absorbed in joyful thoughtFor his dear son, no rest has sought:Sleepless to him the night has past,And now o\\'erwatched he sinks at last.Then go, Sumantra, and with speedThe glorious Ráma hither lead:Go, as I pray, nor longer wait;No time is this to hesitate.\"\"How can I go, O Lady fair,Unless my lord his will declare?\"\"Fain would I see him,\" cried the king,\"Quick, quick, my beauteous Ráma bring.\"Then rose the happy thought to cheerThe bosom of the charioteer,\"The king, I ween, of pious mind,The consecration has designed.\"Sumantra for his wisdom famed,Delighted with the thought he framed,From the calm chamber, like a bayOf crowded ocean, took his way.He turned his face to neither side,But forth he hurried straight;Only a little while he eyedThe guards who kept the gate.He saw in front a gathered crowdOf men of every class,Who, parting as he came, allowedThe charioteer to pass.Canto XV. The Preparations.There slept the Bráhmans, deeply readIn Scripture, till the night had fled;Then, with the royal chaplains, theyTook each his place in long array.There gathered fast the chiefs of trade,Nor peer nor captain long delayed,Assembling all in order dueThe consecrating rite to view.The morning dawned with cloudless rayOn Pushya high auspicious day,And Cancer with benignant powerLooked down on Ráma natal hour.The twice-born chiefs, with zealous heed,Made ready what the rite would need.The well-wrought throne of holy woodAnd golden urns in order stood.There was the royal car whereonA tiger skin resplendent shone;There water, brought for sprinkling thenceWhere, in their sacred confluence,Blend Jumná waves with Gangá tide,From many a holy flood beside,From brook and fountain far and near,From pool and river, sea and mere.And there were honey, curd, and oil,Parched rice and grass, the garden spoil,Fresh milk, eight girls in bright attire,An elephant with eyes of fire;And urns of gold and silver made,With milky branches overlaid,All brimming from each sacred flood,And decked with many a lotus bud.And dancing-women fair and free,Gay with their gems, were there to see,Who stood in bright apparel byWith lovely brow and witching eye.White flashed the jewelled chouri there,And shone like moonbeams through the air;The white umbrella overheadA pale and moonlike lustre shed,Wont in pure splendour to precede,And in such rites the pomp to lead.There stood the charger by the sideOf the great bull of snow-white hide;There was all music soft and loud,And bards and minstrels swelled the crowd.For now the monarch bade combineEach custom of his ancient lineWith every rite Ayodhyá stateObserved, her kings to consecrate.Then, summoned by the king behest,The multitudes together pressed,And, missing still the royal sire,Began, impatient, to inquire:\"Who to our lord will tidings bearThat all his people throng the square?Where is the king? the sun is bright,And all is ready for the rite.\"As thus they spoke, Sumantra, triedIn counsel, to the chiefs replied,Gathered from lands on every side:\"To Ráma house I swiftly drave,For so the king his mandate gave.Our aged lord and Ráma tooIn honour high hold all of you:I in your words (be long your days!)Will ask him why he thus delays.\"Thus spoke the peer in Scripture read,And to the ladies\\' bower he sped.Quick through the gates Sumantra hied,Which access ne\\'er to him denied.Behind the curtained screen he drew,Which veiled the chamber from the view.In benediction loud he raisedHis voice, and thus the monarch praised:\"Sun, Moon, Kuvera, Siva blessKakutstha son with high success!The Lords of air, flood, fire decreeThe victory, my King, to thee!The holy night has past away,Auspicious shines the morning ray.Rise, Lord of men, thy part to takeIn the great rite. Awake! awake!Bráhmans and captains, chiefs of trade,All wait in festive garb arrayed;For thee they look with eager eyes:O Raghu son, awake! arise.\"To him in holy Scripture read,Who hailed him thus, the monarch said,Upraising from his sleep his head:\"Go, Ráma, hither lead as thouWast ordered by the queen but now.Come, tell me why my mandate laidUpon thee thus is disobeyed.Away! and Ráma hither bring;I sleep not: make no tarrying.\"Thus gave the king command anew:Sumantra from his lord withdrew;With head in lowly reverence bent,And filled with thoughts of joy, he went.The royal street he traversed, whereWaved flag and pennon to the air,And, as with joy the car he drove,He let his eyes delighted rove.On every side, where\\'er he came,He heard glad words, their theme the same,As in their joy the gathered folkOf Ráma and the throning spoke.Then saw he Ráma palace brightAnd vast as Mount Kailása height,That glorious in its beauty showedAs Indra own supreme abode:With folding doors both high and wide;With hundred porches beautified:Where golden statues towering roseO\\'er gemmed and coralled porticoes.Bright like a cave in Meru side,Or clouds through Autumn sky that ride:Festooned with length of bloomy twine,Flashing with pearls and jewels\\' shine,While sandal-wood and aloe lentThe mingled riches of their scent;With all the odorous sweets that fillThe breezy heights of Dardar hill.There by the gate the Sáras screamed,And shrill-toned peacocks\\' plumage gleamed.Its floors with deftest art inlaid,Its sculptured wolves in gold arrayed,With its bright sheen the palace tookThe mind of man and chained the look,For like the sun and moon it glowed,And mocked Kuvera loved abode.Circling the walls a crowd he viewedWho stood in reverent attitude,With throngs of countrymen who soughtAcceptance of the gifts they brought.The elephant was stationed there,Appointed Ráma self to bear;Adorned with pearls, his brow and cheekWere sandal-dyed in many a streak,While he, in stature, bulk, and pride,With Indra own Airávat(280) vied.Sumantra, borne by coursers fleet,Flashing a radiance o\\'er the street,To Ráma palace flew,And all who lined the royal road,Or thronged the prince rich abode,Rejoiced as near he drew.And with delight his bosom swelledAs onward still his course he heldThrough many a sumptuous courtLike Indra palace nobly made,Where peacocks revelled in the shade,And beasts of silvan sort.Through many a hall and chamber wide,That with Kailása splendour vied.Or mansions of the Blest,While Ráma friends, beloved and tried,Before his coming stepped aside,Still on Sumantra pressed.He reached the chamber door, where stoodAround his followers young and good,Bard, minstrel, charioteer,Well skilled the tuneful chords to sweep,With soothing strain to lull to sleep,Or laud their master dear.Then, like a dolphin darting throughUnfathomed depths of ocean blueWith store of jewels decked,Through crowded halls that rock-like rose,Or as proud hills where clouds repose,Sumantra sped unchecked--Halls like the glittering domes on highReared for the dwellers of the skyBy heavenly architect.Canto XVI. Ráma Summoned.So through the crowded inner doorSumantra, skilled in ancient lore,On to the private chambers pressedWhich stood apart from all the rest.There youthful warriors, true and bold,Whose ears were ringed with polished gold,All armed with trusty bows and darts,Watched with devoted eyes and hearts.And hoary men, a faithful train,Whose aged hands held staves of cane,The ladies\\' guard, apparelled fairIn red attire, were stationed there.Soon as they saw Sumantra nigh,Each longed his lord to gratify,And from his seat beside the doorUp sprang each ancient servitor.Then to the warders quickly criedThe skilled Sumantra, void of pride:\"Tell Ráma that the charioteerSumantra waits for audience here.\"The ancient men with one accordSeeking the pleasure of their lord,Passing with speed the chamber doorTo Ráma ear the message bore.Forthwith the prince with duteous heedCalled in the messenger with speed,For \\'twas his sire command, he knew,That sent him for the interview.Like Lord Kuvera, well arrayed,He pressed a couch of gold,Wherefrom a covering of brocadeHung down in many a fold.Oil and the sandal fragrant dustHad tinged his body o\\'erDark as the stream the spearman thrustDrains from the wounded boar.Him Sítá watched with tender care,A chouri in her hand,As Chitrá,(281) ever fond in fair,Beside the Moon will stand.Him glorious with unborrowed light,A liberal lord, of sunlike might,Sumantra hailed in words like these,Well skilled in gentle courtesies,As, with joined hands in reverence raised,Upon the beauteous prince he gazed:\"Happy Kausalyá! Blest is she,The Mother of a son like thee.Now rise, O Ráma, speed away.Go to thy sire without delay:For he and Queen Kaikeyí seekAn interview with thee to speak.\"The lion-lord of men, the bestOf splendid heroes, thus addressed,To Sítá spake with joyful cheer:\"The king and queen, my lady dear,Touching the throning, for my sakeSome salutary counsel take.The lady of the full black eyeWould fain her husband gratify,And, all his purpose understood,Counsels the monarch to my good.A happy fate is mine, I ween,When he, consulting with his queen,Sumantra on this charge, intentUpon my gain and good, has sent.An envoy of so noble sortWell suits the splendour of the court.The consecration rite this dayWill join me in imperial sway.To meet the lord of earth, for soHis order bids me, I will go.Thou, lady, here in comfort stay,And with thy maidens rest or play.\"Thus Ráma spake. For meet replyThe lady of the large black eyeAttended to the door her lord,And blessings on his head implored:\"The majesty and royal stateWhich holy Bráhmans venerate,The consecration and the riteWhich sanctifies the ruler might,And all imperial powers should beThine by thy father high decree,As He, the worlds who formed and planned,The kingship gave to Indra hand.Then shall mine eyes my king adoreWhen lustral rites and fast are o\\'er,And black deer skin and roebuck hornThy lordly limbs and hand adorn.May He whose hands the thunder wieldBe in the east thy guard and shield;May Yáma care the south befriend,And Varun arm the west defend;And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,The north with firm protection hold.\"Then Ráma spoke a kind farewell,And hailed the blessings as they fellFrom Sítá gentle lips; and then,As a young lion from his denDescends the mountain stony side,So from the hall the hero hied.First Lakshman at the door he viewedWho stood in reverent attitude,Then to the central court he pressedWhere watched the friends who loved him best.To all his dear companions thereHe gave kind looks and greeting fair.On to the lofty car that glowedLike fire the royal tiger strode.Bright as himself its silver shone:A tiger skin was laid thereon.With cloudlike thunder, as it rolled,It flashed with gems and burnished gold,And, like the sun meridian blaze,Blinded the eye that none could gaze.Like youthful elephants, tall and strong,Fleet coursers whirled the car along:In such a car the Thousand-eyedBorne by swift horses loves to ride.So like Parjanya,(282) when he fliesThundering through the autumn skies,The hero from the palace sped,As leaves the moon some cloud o\\'erhead.Still close to Ráma Lakshman kept,Behind him to the car he leapt,And, watching with fraternal care,Waved the long chouri silver hair,As from the palace gate he cameUp rose the tumult of acclaim.While loud huzza and jubilant shoutPealed from the gathered myriads out.Then elephants, like mountains vast,And steeds who all their kind surpassed,Followed their lord by hundreds, nayBy thousands, led in long array.First marched a band of warriors trained,With sandal dust and aloe stained;Well armed was each with sword and bow,And every breast with hope aglow,And ever, as they onward went,Shouts from the warrior train,And every sweet-toned instrumentProlonged the minstrel strain.On passed the tamer of his foes,While well clad dames, in crowded rows,Each chamber lattice thronged to view,And chaplets on the hero threw.Then all, of peerless face and limb,Sang Ráma praise for love of him,And blent their voices, soft and sweet,From palace high and crowded street:\"Now, sure, Kausalyá heart must swellTo see the son she loves so well,Thee Ráma, thee, her joy and pride,Triumphant o\\'er the realm preside.\"Then--for they knew his bride most fairOf all who part the soft dark hair,His love, his life, possessed the wholeOf her young hero heart and soul:--\"Be sure the lady fate repaysSome mighty vow of ancient days,(283)For blest with Ráma love is sheAs, with the Moon, sweet Rohiní.\"(284)Such were the witching words that cameFrom lips of many a peerless dameCrowding the palace roofs to greetThe hero as he gained the street.Canto XVII. Ráma Approach.As Ráma, rendering blithe and gayHis loving friends, pursued his way,He saw on either hand a pressOf mingled people numberless.The royal street he traversed, whereIncense of aloe filled the air,Where rose high palaces, that viedWith paly clouds, on either side;With flowers of myriad colours graced.And food for every varied taste,Bright as the glowing path o\\'erheadWhich feet of Gods celestial tread,Loud benedictions, sweet to hear,From countless voices soothed his ear.While he to each gave due saluteHis place and dignity to suit:\"Be thou,\" the joyful people cried,\"Be thou our guardian, lord and guide.Throned and anointed king to-day,Thy feet set forth upon the wayWherein, each honoured as a God,Thy fathers and forefathers trod.Thy sire and his have graced the throne,And loving care to us have shown:Thus blest shall we and ours remain,Yea still more blest in Ráma reign.No more of dainty fare we need,And but one cherished object heed,That we may see our prince todayInvested with imperial sway.\"Such were the words and pleasant speechThat Ráma heard, unmoved, from eachOf the dear friends around him spread,As onward through the street he sped,For none could turn his eye or thoughtFrom the dear form his glances sought,With fruitless ardour forward castEven when Raghu son had past.And he who saw not Ráma nigh,Nor caught a look from Ráma eye,A mark for scorn and general blame,Reproached himself in bitter shame.For to each class his equal mindWith sympathy and love inclinedMost fully of the princely four,So greatest love to him they bore.His circling course the hero bentRound shrine and altar, reverent,Round homes of Gods, where cross-roads met,Where many a sacred tree was set.Near to his father house he drewLike Indra beautiful to view,And with the light his glory gaveWithin the royal palace drave.Through three broad courts, where bowmen keptTheir watch and ward, his coursers swept,Then through the two remaining wentOn foot the prince preëminent.Through all the courts the hero passed,And gained the ladies\\' bower at last;Then through the door alone withdrew,And left without his retinue.When thus the monarch noble boyHad gone his sire to meet,The multitude, elate with joy,Stood watching in the street,And his return with eager eyesExpected at the gates,As for his darling moon to riseThe King of Rivers(285) waits.Canto XVIII. The Sentence.With hopeless eye and pallid mienThere sat the monarch with the queen.His father feet with reverence dueHe clasped, and touched Kaikeyí too.The king, with eyes still brimming o\\'er,Cried Ráma! and could do no more.His voice was choked, his eye was dim,He could not speak or look on him.Then sudden fear made Ráma shakeAs though his foot had roused a snake,Soon as his eyes had seen the changeSo mournful, terrible, and strange.For there his reason well-nigh fled,Sighing, with soul disquieted,To torturing pangs a prey,Dismayed, despairing, and distraught,In a fierce whirl of wildering thoughtThe hapless monarch lay,Like Ocean wave-engarlandedStorm-driven from his tranquil bed,The Sun-God in eclipse,Or like a holy seer, heart-stirredWith anguish, when a lying wordHas passed his heedless lips.The sight of his dear father, painedWith woe and misery unexplainedFilled Ráma with unrest,As Ocean pulses rise and swellWhen the great moon he loves so wellShines full upon his breast.So grieving for his father sake,To his own heart the hero spake:\"Why will the king my sire to-dayNo kindly word of greeting say?At other times, though wroth he be,His eyes grow calm that look on me.Then why does anguish wring his browTo see his well-beloved now?\"Sick and perplexed, distraught with woe,To Queen Kaikeyí bowing low,While pallor o\\'er his bright cheek spread,With humble reverence he said:\"What have I done, unknown, amissTo make my father wroth like this?Declare it, O dear Queen, and winHis pardon for my heedless sin.Why is the sire I ever findFilled with all love to-day unkind?With eyes cast down and pallid cheekThis day alone he will not speak.Or lies he prostrate neath the blowOf fierce disease or sudden woe?For all our bliss is dashed with pain,And joy unmixt is hard to gain.Does stroke of evil fortune smiteDear Bharat, charming to the sight,Or on the brave Satrughna fall,Or consorts, for he loves them all?Against his words when I rebel,Or fail to please the monarch well,When deeds of mine his soul offend,That hour I pray my life may end.How should a man to him who gaveHis being and his life behave?The sire to whom he owes his birthShould be his deity on earth.Hast thou, by pride and folly moved,With bitter taunt the king reproved?Has scorn of thine or cruel jestTo passion stirred his gentle breast?Speak truly, Queen, that I may knowWhat cause has changed the monarch so.\"Thus by the high-souled prince addressed,Of Raghu sons the chief and best,She cast all ruth and shame aside,And bold with greedy words replied:\"Not wrath, O Ráma, stirs the king,Nor misery stabs with sudden sting;One thought that fills his soul has he,But dares not speak for fear of thee.Thou art so dear, his lips refrainFrom words that might his darling pain.But thou, as duty bids, must stillThe promise of thy sire fulfil.He who to me in days gone byVouchsafed a boon with honours high,Dares now, a king, his word regret,And caitiff-like disowns the debt.The lord of men his promise gaveTo grant the boon that I might crave,And now a bridge would idly throwWhen the dried stream has ceased to flow.His faith the monarch must not breakIn wrath, or e\\'en for thy dear sake.From faith, as well the righteous know,Our virtue and our merits flow.Now, be they good or be they ill,Do thou thy father words fulfil:Swear that his promise shall not fail,And I will tell thee all the tale.Yes, Ráma, when I hear that thouHast bound thee by thy father vow,Then, not till then, my lips shall speak,Nor will he tell what boon I seek.\"He heard, and with a troubled breastThis answer to the queen addressed:\"Ah me, dear lady, canst thou deemThat words like these thy lips beseem?I, at the bidding of my sire,Would cast my body to the fire,A deadly draught of poison drink,Or in the waves of ocean sink:If he command, it shall be done,--My father and my king in one.Then speak and let me know the thingSo longed for by my lord the king.It shall be done: let this suffice;Ráma ne\\'er makes a promise twice.\"He ended. To the princely youthWho loved the right and spoke the truth,Cruel, abominable cameThe answer of the ruthless dame:\"When Gods and Titans fought of yore,Transfixed with darts and bathed in goreTwo boons to me thy father gaveFor the dear life \\'twas mine to save.Of him I claim the ancient debt,That Bharat on the throne be set,And thou, O Ráma, go this dayTo Dandak forest far away.Now, Ráma, if thou wilt maintainThy father faith without a stain,And thine own truth and honour clear,Then, best of men, my bidding hear.Do thou thy father word obey,Nor from the pledge he gave me stray.Thy life in Dandak forest spendTill nine long years and five shall end.Upon my Bharat princely headLet consecrating drops be shed,With all the royal pomp for theeMade ready by the king decree.Seek Dandak forest and resignRites that would make the empire thine,For twice seven years of exile wearThe coat of bark and matted hair.Then in thy stead let Bharat reignLord of his royal sire domain,Rich in the fairest gems that shine,Cars, elephants, and steeds, and kine.The monarch mourns thy altered fateAnd vails his brow compassionate:Bowed down by bitter grief he liesAnd dares not lift to thine his eyes.Obey his word: be firm and brave,And with great truth the monarch save.\"While thus with cruel words she spoke,No grief the noble youth betrayed;But forth the father anguish broke,At his dear Ráma lot dismayed.Canto XIX. Ráma Promise.Calm and unmoved by threatened woeThe noble conqueror of the foeAnswered the cruel words she spoke,Nor quailed beneath the murderous stroke:\"Yea, for my father promise sakeI to the wood my way will take,And dwell a lonely exile thereIn hermit dress with matted hair.One thing alone I fain would learn,Why is the king this day so stern?Why is the scourge of foes so cold,Nor gives me greeting as of old?Now let not anger flush thy cheek:Before thy face the truth I speak,In hermit coat with matted hairTo the wild wood will I repair.How can I fail his will to do,Friend, master, grateful sovereign too?One only pang consumes my breast:That his own lips have not expressedHis will, nor made his longing knownThat Bharat should ascend the throne.To Bharat I would yield my wife,My realm and wealth, mine own dear life,Unasked I fain would yield them all:More gladly at my father call,More gladly when the gift may freeHis honour and bring joy to thee.Thus, lady, his sad heart releaseFrom the sore shame, and give him peace.But tell me, O, I pray thee, whyThe lord of men, with downcast eye,Lies prostrate thus, and one by oneDown his pale cheek the tear-drops run.Let couriers to thy father speedOn horses of the swiftest breed,And, by the mandate of the king,Thy Bharat to his presence bring.My father words I will not stayTo question, but this very dayTo Dandak pathless wild will fare,For twice seven years an exile there.\"When Ráma thus had made replyKaikeyí heart with joy beat high.She, trusting to the pledge she held,The youth departure thus impelled:\"\\'Tis well. Be messengers despatchedOn coursers ne\\'er for fleetness matched,To seek my father home and leadMy Bharat back with all their speed.And, Ráma, as I ween that thouWilt scarce endure to linger now,So surely it were wise and goodThis hour to journey to the wood.And if, with shame cast down and weak,No word to thee the king can speak,Forgive, and from thy mind dismissA trifle in an hour like this.But till thy feet in rapid hasteHave left the city for the waste,And to the distant forest fled,He will not bathe nor call for bread.\"\"Woe! woe!\" from the sad monarch burst,In surging floods of grief immersed;Then swooning, with his wits astray,Upon the gold-wrought couch he lay,And Ráma raised the aged king:But the stern queen, unpitying,Checked not her needless words, nor sparedThe hero for all speed prepared,But urged him with her bitter tongue,Like a good horse with lashes stung,She spoke her shameful speech. SereneHe heard the fury of the queen,And to her words so vile and dreadGently, unmoved in mind, he said:\"I would not in this world remainA grovelling thrall to paltry gain,But duty path would fain pursue,True as the saints themselves are true.From death itself I would not flyMy father wish to gratify,What deed soe\\'er his loving sonMay do to please him, think it done.Amid all duties, Queen, I countThis duty first and paramount,That sons, obedient, aye fulfilTheir honoured fathers\\' word and will.Without his word, if thou decree,Forth to the forest will I flee,And there shall fourteen years be spentMid lonely wilds in banishment.Methinks thou couldst not hope to findOne spark of virtue in my mind,If thou, whose wish is still my lord,Hast for this grace the king implored.This day I go, but, ere we part,Must cheer my Sítá tender heart,To my dear mother bid farewell;Then to the woods, a while to dwell.With thee, O Queen, the care must restThat Bharat hear his sire behest,And guard the land with righteous sway,For such the law that lives for aye.\"In speechless woe the father heard,Wept with loud cries, but spoke no word.Then Ráma touched his senseless feet,And hers, for honour most unmeet;Round both his circling steps he bent,Then from the bower the hero went.Soon as he reached the gate he foundHis dear companions gathered round.Behind him came Sumitrá childWith weeping eyes so sad and wild.Then saw he all that rich arrayOf vases for the glorious day.Round them with reverent stops he paced,Nor vailed his eye, nor moved in haste.The loss of empire could not dimThe glory that encompassed him.So will the Lord of Cooling Rays(286)On whom the world delights to gaze,Through the great love of all retainSweet splendour in the time of wane.Now to the exile lot resignedHe left the rule of earth behind:As though all worldly cares he spurnedNo trouble was in him discerned.The chouries that for kings are used,And white umbrella, he refused,Dismissed his chariot and his men,And every friend and citizen.He ruled his senses, nor betrayedThe grief that on his bosom weighed,And thus his mother mansion soughtTo tell the mournful news he brought.Nor could the gay-clad people thereWho flocked round Ráma true and fair,One sign of altered fortune traceUpon the splendid hero face.Nor had the chieftain, mighty-armed,Lost the bright look all hearts that charmed,As e\\'en from autumn moons is thrownA splendour which is all their own.With his sweet voice the hero spokeSaluting all the gathered folk,Then righteous-souled and great in fameClose to his mother house he came.Lakshman the brave, his brother peerIn princely virtues, followed near,Sore troubled, but resolved to showNo token of his secret woe.Thus to the palace Ráma wentWhere all were gay with hope and joy;But well he knew the dire eventThat hope would mar, that bliss destroy.So to his grief he would not yieldLest the sad change their hearts might rend,And, the dread tiding unrevealed,Spared from the blow each faithful friend.Canto XX. Kausalyá Lament.But in the monarch palace, whenSped from the bower that lord of men,Up from the weeping women wentA mighty wail and wild lament:\"Ah, he who ever freely didHis duty ere his sire could bid,Our refuge and our sure defence,This day will go an exile hence,He on Kausalyá loves to waitMost tender and affectionate,And as he treats his mother, thusFrom childhood has he treated us.On themes that sting he will not speak,And when reviled is calm and meek.He soothes the angry, heals offence:He goes to-day an exile hence.Our lord the king is most unwise,And looks on life with doting eyes,Who in his folly casts awayThe world protection, hope, and stay.\"Thus in their woe, like kine bereavedOf their young calves,(287) the ladies grieved,And ever as they wept and wailedWith keen reproach the king assailed.Their lamentation, mixed with tears,Smote with new grief the monarch ears,Who, burnt with woe too great to bear,Fell on his couch and fainted there.Then Ráma, smitten with the painHis heaving heart could scarce restrain,Groaned like an elephant and strodeWith Lakshman to the queen abode.A warder there, whose hoary eldIn honour high by all was held,Guarding the mansion, sat beforeThe portal, girt with many more.Swift to their feet the warders sprang,And loud the acclamation rang,Hail, Ráma! as to him they bent,Of victor chiefs preëminent.One court he passed, and in the nextSaw, masters of each Veda text,A crowd of Bráhmans, good and sage,Dear to the king for lore and age.To these he bowed his reverent head,Thence to the court beyond he sped.Old dames and tender girls, their careTo keep the doors, were stationed there.And all, when Ráma came in view,Delighted to the chamber flew,To bear to Queen Kausalyá earThe tidings that she loved to hear.The queen, on rites and prayer intent,In careful watch the night had spent,And at the dawn, her son to aid,To Vishnu holy offerings made.Firm in her vows, serenely glad,In robes of spotless linen clad,As texts prescribe, with grace implored,Her offerings in the fire she poured.Within her splendid bower he came,And saw her feed the sacred flame.There oil, and grain, and vases stood,With wreaths, and curds, and cates, and wood,And milk, and sesamum, and rice,The elements of sacrifice.She, worn and pale with many a fastAnd midnight hours in vigil past,In robes of purest white arrayed,To Lakshmí Queen drink-offerings paid.So long away, she flew to meetThe darling of her soul:So runs a mare with eager feetTo welcome back her foal.He with his firm support upheldThe queen, as near she drew,And, by maternal love impelled,Her arms around him threw.Her hero son, her matchless boyShe kissed upon the head:She blessed him in her pride and joyWith tender words, and said:\"Be like thy royal sires of old,The nobly good, the lofty-souled!Their lengthened days and fame be thine,And virtue, as beseems thy line!The pious king, thy father, seeTrue to his promise made to thee:That truth thy sire this day will show,And regent power on thee bestow.\"She spoke. He took the proffered seat,And as she pressed her son to eat,Raised reverent bands, and, touched with shame,Made answer to the royal dame:\"Dear lady, thou hast yet to knowThat danger threats, and heavy woe:A grief that will with sore distressOn Sítá, thee, and Lakshman press.What need of seats have such as I?This day to Dandak wood I fly.The hour is come, a time, unmeetFor silken couch and gilded seat.I must to lonely wilds repair,Abstain from flesh, and living thereOn roots, fruit, honey, hermit food,Pass twice seven years in solitude.To Bharat hand the king will yieldThe regent power I thought to wield,And me, a hermit, will he sendMy days in Dandak wood to spend.\"As when the woodman axe has loppedA Sal branch in the grove, she dropped:So from the skies a Goddess fallsEjected from her radiant halls.When Ráma saw her lying low,Prostrate by too severe a blow,Around her form his arms he woundAnd raised her fainting from the ground.His hand upheld her like a mareWho feels her load too sore to bear,And sinks upon the way o\\'ertoiled,And all her limbs with dust are soiled.He soothed her in her wild distressWith loving touch and soft caress.She, meet for highest fortune, eyedThe hero watching by her side,And thus, while Lakshman bent to hear,Addressed her son with many a tear!\"If, Ráma, thou had ne\\'er been bornMy child to make thy mother mourn,Though reft of joy, a childless queen,Such woe as this I ne\\'er had seen.Though to the childless wife there clingsOne sorrow armed with keenest stings,\"No child have I: no child have I,\"No second misery prompts the sigh.When long I sought, alas, in vain,My husband love and bliss to gain,In Ráma all my hopes I setAnd dreamed I might be happy yet.I, of the consorts first and best,Must bear my rivals\\' taunt and jest,And brook, though better far than they,The soul distressing words they say.What woman can be doomed to pineIn misery more sore than mine,Whose hopeless days must still be spentIn grief that ends not and lament?They scorned me when my son was nigh;When he is banished I must die.Me, whom my husband never prized,Kaikeyí retinue despisedWith boundless insolence, though sheTops not in rank nor equals me.And they who do me service yet,Nor old allegiance quite forget,Whene\\'er they see Kaikeyí son,With silent lips my glances shun.How, O my darling, shall I brookEach menace of Kaikeyí look,And listen, in my low estate,To taunts of one so passionate?For seventeen years since thou wast bornI sat and watched, ah me, forlorn!Hoping some blessed day to seeDeliverance from my woes by thee.Now comes this endless grief and wrong,So dire I cannot bear it long,Sinking, with age and sorrow worn,Beneath my rivals\\' taunts and scorn.How shall I pass in dark distressMy long lone days of wretchednessWithout my Ráma face, as brightAs the full moon to cheer my sight?Alas, my cares thy steps to train,And fasts, and vows, and prayers are vain.Hard, hard, I ween, must be this heartTo hear this blow nor burst apart,As some great river bank, when firstThe floods of Rain-time on it burst.No, Fate that speeds not will not slay,Nor Yama halls vouchsafe me room,Or, like a lion weeping prey,Death now had borne me to my doom.Hard is my heart and wrought of steelThat breaks not with the crushing blow,Or in the pangs this day I feelMy lifeless frame had sunk below.Death waits his hour, nor takes me now:But this sad thought augments my pain,That prayer and largess, fast and vow,And Heavenward service are in vain.Ah me, ah me! with fruitless toilOf rites austere a child I sought:Thus seed cast forth on barren soilStill lifeless lies and comes to naught.If ever wretch by anguish grievedBefore his hour to death had fled,I mourning, like a cow bereaved,Had been this day among the dead.\"Canto XXI. Kausalyá Calmed.While thus Kausalyá wept and sighed,With timely words sad Lakshman cried:\"O honoured Queen I like it illThat, subject to a woman will,Ráma his royal state should quitAnd to an exile doom submit.The aged king, fond, changed, and weak,Will as the queen compels him speak.But why should Ráma thus be sentTo the wild woods in banishment?No least offence I find in him,I see no fault his fame to dim.Not one in all the world I know,Not outcast wretch, not secret foe,Whose whispering lips would dare assailHis spotless life with slanderous tale.Godlike and bounteous, just, sincere,E\\'en to his very foemen dear:Who would without a cause neglectThe right, and such a son reject?And if a king such order gave,In second childhood, passion slave,What son within his heart would layThe senseless order, and obey?Come, Ráma, ere this plot be knownStand by me and secure the throne.Stand like the King who rules below,Stand aided by thy brother bow:How can the might of meaner menResist thy royal purpose then?My shafts, if rebels court their fate,Shall lay Ayodhyá desolate.Then shall her streets with blood be dyedOf those who stand on Bharat side:None shall my slaughtering hand exempt,For gentle patience earns contempt.If, by Kaikeyí counsel changed,Our father heart be thus estranged,No mercy must our arm restrain,But let the foe be slain, be slain.For should the guide, respected long,No more discerning right and wrong,Turn in forbidden paths to stray,\\'Tis meet that force his steps should stay.What power sufficient can he see,What motive for the wish has he,That to Kaikeyí would resignThe empire which is justly thine?Can he, O conqueror of thy foes,Thy strength and mine in war oppose?Can he entrust, in our despite,To Bharat hand thy royal right?I love this brother with the wholeAffection of my faithful soul.Yea Queen, by bow and truth I swear,By sacrifice, and gift, and prayer,If Ráma to the forest goes,Or where the burning furnace glows,First shall my feet the forest tread,The flames shall first surround my head.My might shall chase thy grief and tears,As darkness flies when morn appears.Do thou, dear Queen, and Ráma tooBehold what power like mine can do.My aged father I will kill,The vassal of Kaikeyí will,Old, yet a child, the woman thrall,Infirm, and base, the scorn of all.\"Thus Lakshman cried, the mighty-souled:Down her sad cheeks the torrents rolled,As to her son Kausalyá spake:\"Now thou hast heard thy brother, takeHis counsel if thou hold it wise,And do the thing his words advise,Do not, my son, with tears I pray,My rival wicked word obey,Leave me not here consumed with woe,Nor to the wood, an exile, go.If thou, to virtue ever true,Thy duty path would still pursue,The highest duty bids thee stayAnd thus thy mother voice obey.Thus Kasyap great ascetic sonA seat among the Immortals won:In his own home, subdued, he stayed,And honour to his mother paid.If reverence to thy sire be due,Thy mother claims like honour too,And thus I charge thee, O my child,Thou must not seek the forest wild.Ah, what to me were life and bliss,Condemned my darling son to miss?But with my Ráma near, to eatThe very grass itself were sweet.But if thou still wilt go and leaveThy hapless mother here to grieve,I from that hour will food abjure,Nor life without my son endure.Then it will be thy fate to dwellIn depth of world-detested hell.As Ocean in the olden timeWas guilty of an impious crimeThat marked the lord of each fair floodAs one who spills a Bráhman blood.\"(288)Thus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:Then righteous Ráma thus replied:\"I have no power to slight or breakCommandments which my father spake.I bend my head, dear lady, low,Forgive me, for I needs must go.Once Kandu, mighty saint, who madeHis dwelling in the forest shade,A cow--and duty claims he knew--Obedient to his father, slew.And in the line from which we spring,When ordered by their sire the king,Through earth the sons of Sagar cleft,And countless things of life bereft.(289)So Jamadagní son(290) obeyedHis sire, when in the wood he laidHis hand upon his axe, and smoteThrough Renuká his mother throat.The deeds of these and more beside.Peers of the Gods, my steps shall guide,And resolute will I fulfilMy father word, my father will.Nor I, O Queen, unsanctioned treadThis righteous path, by duty led:The road my footsteps journey o\\'erWas traversed by the great of yore.This high command which all acceptShall faithfully by me be kept,For duty ne\\'er will him forsakeWho fears his sire command to break.\"Thus to his mother wild with grief:Then thus to Lakshman spake the chiefOf those by whom the bow is bent,Mid all who speak, most eloquent:\"I know what love for me thou hast,What firm devotion unsurpassed:Thy valour and thy worth I know,And glory that appals the foe.Blest youth, my mother woe is great,It bends her \\'neath its matchless weight:No claims will she, with blinded eyes,Of truth and patience recognize.For duty is supreme in place,And truth is duty noblest base.Obedient to my sire behestI serve the cause of duty best.For man should truly do whate\\'erTo mother, Bráhman, sire, he sware:He must in duty path remain,Nor let his word be pledged in vain.And, O my brother, how can IObedience to this charge deny?Kaikeyí tongue my purpose spurred,But \\'twas my sire who gave the word.Cast these unholy thoughts asideWhich smack of war and Warriors\\' pride;To duty call, not wrath attend,And tread the path which I commend.\"Ráma by fond affection movedHis brother Lakshman thus reproved;Then with joined hands and reverent headAgain to Queen Kausalyá said:\"I needs must go--do thou consent--To the wild wood in banishment.O give me, by my life I pray,Thy blessing ere I go away.I, when the promised years are o\\'er,Shall see Ayodhyá town once more.Then, mother dear, thy tears restrain,Nor let thy heart be wrung by pain:In time, my father will obeyed,Shall I return from greenwood shade.My dear Videhan, thou, and I,Lakshman, Sumitrá, feel this tie,And must my father word obey,As duty bids that rules for aye.Thy preparations now forgo,And lock within thy breast thy woe,Nor be my pious wish withstoodTo go an exile to the wood.\"Calm and unmoved the prince explainedHis duty claim and purpose high,The mother life and sense regained,Looked on her son and made reply:\"If reverence be thy father due,The same by right and love is mine:Go not, my charge I thus renew,Nor leave me here in woe to pine,What were such lonely life to me,Rites to the shades, or deathless lot?More dear, my son, one hour with theeThan all the world where thou art not.\"As bursts to view, when brands blaze high,Some elephant concealed by night,So, when he heard his mother cry,Burnt Ráma grief with fiercer might.Thus to the queen, half senseless still,And Lakshman, burnt with heart-felt pain,True to the right, with steadfast will,His duteous speech he spoke again:\"Brother, I know thy loving mind,Thy valour and thy truth I know,But now to claims of duty blindThou and my mother swell my woe.The fruits of deeds in human lifeMake love, gain, duty, manifest,Dear when they meet as some fond wifeWith her sweet babes upon her breast.But man to duty first should turnWhene\\'er the three are not combined:For those who heed but gain we spurn,And those to pleasure all resigned.Shall then the virtuous disobeyHosts of an aged king and sire,Though feverous joy that father sway,Or senseless love or causeless ire?I have no power, commanded thus,To slight his promise and decree:The honoured sire of both of us,My mother lord and life is he.Shall she, while yet the holy kingIs living, on the right intent,--Shall she, like some poor widowed thing,Go forth with me to banishment?Now, mother, speed thy parting son,And let thy blessing soothe my pain,That I may turn, mine exile done,Like King Yayáti, home again.Fair glory and the fruit she gives,For lust of sway I ne\\'er will slight:What, for the span a mortal lives.Were rule of faith without the right?\"He soothed her thus, firm to the lastHis counsel to his brother told:Then round the queen in reverence passed,And held her in his loving hold.Canto XXII. Lakshman Calmed.So Ráma kept unshaken stillHis noble heart with iron will.To his dear brother next he turned,Whose glaring eyes with fury burned,Indignant, panting like a snake,And thus again his counsel spake:\"Thine anger and thy grief restrain,And firm in duty path remain.Dear brother, lay thy scorn aside,And be the right thy joy and pride.Thy ready zeal and thoughtful careTo aid what rites should grace the heir,--These \\'tis another now to ask;Come, gird thee for thy noble task,That Bharat throning rites may heGraced with the things prepared for me.And with thy gentle care provideThat her fond heart, now sorely triedWith fear and longing for my sake,With doubt and dread may never ache.To know that thoughts of coming illOne hour that tender bosom fillWith agony and dark despairIs grief too great for me to bear.I cannot, brother, call to mindOne wilful fault or undesigned,When I have pained in anythingMy mothers or my sire the king.The right my father keeps in view,In promise, word, and action true;Let him then all his fear dismiss,Nor dread the loss of future bliss.He fears his truth herein will fail:Hence bitter thoughts his heart assail.He trembles lest the rites proceed,And at his pangs my heart should bleed.So now this earnest wish is mine,The consecration to resign,And from this city turn awayTo the wild wood with no delay.My banishment to-day will freeKaikeyí from her cares, that she,At last contented and elate,May Bharat throning celebrate.Then will the lady trouble cease,Then will her heart have joy and peace,When wandering in the wood I wearDeerskin, and bark, and matted hair.Nor shall by me his heart be grievedWhose choice approved, whose mind conceivedThis counsel which I follow. No,Forth to the forest will I go.\\'Tis Fate, Sumitrás son, confess,That sends me to the wilderness.\\'Tis Fate alone that gives awayTo other hands the royal sway.How could Kaikeyí purpose bringOn me this pain and suffering,Were not her change of heart decreedBy Fate whose will commands the deed?I know my filial love has beenThe same throughout for every queen,And with the same affection sheHas treated both her son and me.Her shameful words of cruel spiteTo stay the consecrating rite,And drive me banished from the throne,--These I ascribe to Fate alone,How could she, born of royal race,Whom nature decks with fairest grace,Speak like a dame of low degreeBefore the king to torture me?But Fate, which none may comprehend,To which all life must bow and bend,In her and me its power has shown,And all my hopes are overthrown.What man, Sumitrá darling, mayContend with Fate resistless sway,Whose all-commanding power we findOur former deeds alone can bind?Our life and death, our joy and pain,Anger and fear, and loss and gain,Each thing that is, in every state,All is the work of none but Fate.E\\'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal,When once the stroke of Fate they feel,In sternest vows no more engage,And fall enslaved by love and rage.So now the sudden stroke whose weightDescends unlooked for, comes of Fate,And with unpitying might destroysThe promise of commencing joys.Weigh this true counsel in thy soul:With thy firm heart thy heart control;Then, brother, thou wilt cease to grieveFor hindered rites which now I leave.So cast thy needless grief away,And strictly my commands obey.Those preparations check with speed,Nor let my throning rites proceed.Those urns that stand prepared to shedKing-making drops upon my head,Shall, with their pure lustrations nowInaugurate my hermit vow.Yet what have I to do with thingsThat touch the state and pomp of kings?These hands of mine shall water takeTo sanctify the vow I make.Now Lakshman, let thy heart no moreMy fortune changed and lost deplore.A forest life more joys may bringThan those that wait upon a king,Now though her arts successful marMy consecrating rite,Let not the youngest queen too farThy jealous fear excite.Nor let one thought suggesting illUpon our father fall,But let thy heart remember stillThat Fate is lord of all.\"Canto XXIII. Lakshman Anger.Thus Ráma to his brother said;And Lakshman bent his drooping head.In turns by grief and pride impelled,A middle course of thought he held,Then in a frown of anger, bentHis brows that chief most excellent,And like a serpent in his hole,Breathed fierce and fast in wrath of soul.His threatening brows so darkly frowned,His eyes so fiercely glanced around,They made his glare, which none might brook,Like some infuriate lion look.Like some wild elephant, full oftHe raised and shook his hand(291) aloft.Now turned his neck to left and rightNow bent, now raised its stately height.Now in his rage that sword he feltWhich mangling wounds to foemen dealt,With sidelong glance his brother eyed,And thus in burning words replied:\"Thy rash resolve, thy eager haste,Thy mighty fear, are all misplaced:No room is here for duty claim,No cause to dread the people blame.Can one as brave as thou consentTo use a coward argument?The glory of the Warrior raceWith craven speech his lips debase?Can one like thee so falsely speak,Exalting Fate, confessed so weak?Canst thou, undoubting still restrain?Suspicions of those sinful twain?Canst thou, most duteous, fail to knowTheir hearts are set on duty show?They with deceit have set their trains,And now the fruit rewards their pains.Had they not long ago agreed,O Ráma, on this treacherous deed,That promised boon, so long retained,He erst had given and she had gained.I cannot, O my brother, bearTo see another throned as heirWith rites which all our people hate:Then, O, this passion tolerate.This vaunted duty which can guideThy steps from wisdom path aside,And change the counsel of thy breast,O lofty-hearted, I detest.Wilt thou, when power and might are thine,Submit to this abhorred design?Thy father impious hest fulfil,That vassal of Kaikeyí will?But if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,Nor see the guile herein that lies,My soul is sad, I deeply mourn,And duty seems a thing to scorn.Canst thou one moment think to pleaseThis pair who live for love and ease,And \\'gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,With tenderest names their hatred hide?Now if thy judgment still refersTo Fate this plot of his and hers,My mind herein can ne\\'er agree:And O, in this be ruled by me.Weak, void of manly pride are theyWho bend to Fate imputed sway:The choicest souls, the nobly greatDisdain to bow their heads to Fate.And he who dares his Fate controlWith vigorous act and manly soul,Though threatening Fate his hopes assail,Unmoved through all need never quail.This day mankind shall learn arightThe power of Fate and human might,So shall the gulf that lies betweenA man and Fate be clearly seen.The might of Fate subdued by meThis hour the citizens shall see,Who saw its intervention stayThy consecrating rites to-day.My power shall turn this Fate aside,That threatens, as, with furious stride,An elephant who scorns to feel,In rage unchecked, the driver steel.Not the great Lords whose sleepless mightProtects the worlds, shall stay the riteThough earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:And shall we fear this sire of ours?Then if their minds are idly bentTo doom thee, King, to banishment,Through twice seven years of exile theyShall in the lonely forest stay.I will consume the hopes that fireThe queen Kaikeyí and our sire,That to her son this check will bringAdvantage, making Bharat king.The power of Fate will ne\\'er withstandThe might that arms my vigorous hand;If danger and distress assail,My fearless strength will still prevail.A thousand circling years shall flee:The forest then thy home shall be,And thy good sons, succeeding, holdThe empire which their sire controlled.The royal saints, of old who reigned,For aged kings this rest ordained:These to their sons their realm commitThat they, like sires, may cherish it.O pious soul, if thou declineThe empire which is justly thine,Lest, while the king distracted lies,Disorder in the state should rise,I,--or no mansion may I findIn worlds to hero souls assigned,--The guardian of thy realm will be,As the sea-bank protects the sea.Then cast thine idle fears aside:With prosperous rites be sanctified.The lords of earth may strive in vain:My power shall all their force restrain.My pair of arms, my warrior bowAre not for pride or empty show:For no support these shafts were made;And binding up ill suits my blade:To pierce the foe with deadly breach--This is the work of all and each.But small, methinks the love I showFor him I count my mortal foe.Soon as my trenchant steel is bare,Flashing its lightning through the air,I heed no foe, nor stand aghastThough Indra self the levin cast.Then shall the ways be hard to pass,Where chariots lie in ruinous mass;When elephant and man and steedCrushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,And legs and heads fall, heap on heap,Beneath my sword tremendous sweep.Struck by my keen brand trenchant blade,Thine enemies shall fall dismayed,Like towering mountains rent in twain,Or lightning clouds that burst in rain.When armed with brace and glove I stand,And take my trusty bow in hand,Who then shall vaunt his might? who dareCount him a man to meet me there?Then will I loose my shafts, and strikeMan, elephant, and steed alike:At one shall many an arrow fly,And many a foe with one shall die.This day the world my power shall see,That none in arms can rival me:My strength the monarch shall abase,And set thee, lord, in lordliest place.These arms which breathe the sandal scent,Which golden bracelets ornament,These hands which precious gifts bestow,Which guard the friend and smite the foe,A nobler service shall assay,And fight in Ráma cause to-day,The robbers of thy rights to stay.Speak, brother, tell thy foeman nameWhom I, in conquering strife,May strip of followers and fame,Of fortune, or of life.Say, how may all this sea-girt landBe brought to own thy sway:Thy faithful servant here I standTo listen and obey.\"Then strove the bride of Raghu raceSad Lakshman heart to cheer,While slowly down the hero face,Unchecked, there rolled a tear.\"The orders of my sire,\" he cried,\"My will shall ne\\'er oppose:I follow still, whate\\'er betide,The path which duty shows.\"Canto XXIV. Kausalyá Calmed.But when Kausalyásaw that heResolved to keep his sire decree,While tears and sobs her utterance broke,Her very righteous speech she spoke:\"Can he, a stranger yet to pain,Whose pleasant words all hearts enchain,Son of the king and me the queen,Live on the grain his hands may glean;Can he, whose slaves and menials eatThe finest cakes of sifted wheat--Can Ráma in the forest liveOn roots and fruit which woodlands give;Who will believe, who will not fearWhen the sad story smites his ear,That one so dear, so noble held,Is by the king his sire expelled?Now surely none may Fate resist,Which orders all as it may list,If, Ráma, in thy strength and grace,The woods become thy dwelling-place.A childless mother long I grieved,And many a sigh for offspring heaved,With wistful longing weak and wornTill thou at last, my son, wast born.Fanned by the storm of that desireDeep in my soul I felt the fire,Whose offerings flowed from weeping eyes,With fuel fed of groans and sighs,While round the flame the smoke grew hotOf tears because thou camest not.Now reft of thee, too fiery fierceThe flame of woe my heart will pierce,As, when the days of spring return,The sun hot beams the forest burn.The mother cow still follows nearThe wanderings of her youngling dear.So close to thine my feet shall be,Where\\'er thou goest following thee.\"Ráma, the noblest lord of men,Heard his fond mother speech, and thenIn soothing words like these repliedTo the sad queen who wept and sighed:\"Nay, by Kaikeyí art beguiled,When I am banished to the wild,If thou, my mother, also fly,The aged king will surely die.When wedded dames their lords forsake,Long for the crime their souls shall ache.Thou must not e\\'en in thought withinThy bosom frame so dire a sin.Long as Kakutstha son, who reignsLord of the earth, in life remains,Thou must with love his will obey:This duty claims, supreme for aye.Yes, mother, thou and I must beSubmissive to my sire decree,King, husband, sire is he confessed,The lord of all, the worthiest.I in the wilds my days will spendTill twice seven years have reached an end,Then with great joy will come again,And faithful to thy hests remain.\"Kausalyá by her son addressed,With love and passion sore distressed,Afflicted, with her eyes bedewed,To Ráma thus her speech renewed:\"Nay, Ráma, but my heart will breakIf with these queens my home I make.Lead me too with thee; let me goAnd wander like a woodland roe.\"Then, while no tear the hero shed,Thus to the weeping queen he said:\"Mother, while lives the husband, heIs woman lord and deity.O dearest lady, thou and IOur lord and king must ne\\'er deny;The lord of earth himself have weOur guardian wise and friend to be.And Bharat, true to duty call,Whose sweet words take the hearts of all,Will serve thee well, and ne\\'er forgetThe virtuous path before him set.Be this, I pray, thine earnest care,That the old king my father ne\\'er,When I have parted hence, may know,Grieved for his son, a pang of woe.Let not this grief his soul distress,To kill him with the bitterness.With duteous care, in every thing,Love, comfort, cheer the aged king.Though, best of womankind, a spouseKeeps firmly all her fasts and vows,Nor yet her husband will obeys,She treads in sin forbidden ways.She to her husband will who bends,Goes to high bliss that never ends,Yea, though the Gods have found in herNo reverential worshipper.Bent on his weal, a woman stillMust seek to do her husband will:For Scripture, custom, law upholdThis duty Heaven revealed of old.Honour true Bráhmans for my sake,And constant offerings duly make,With fire-oblations and with flowers,To all the host of heavenly powers.Look to the coming time, and yearnFor the glad hour of my return.And still thy duteous course pursue,Abstemious, humble, kind, and true.The highest bliss shalt thou obtainWhen I from exile come again,If, best of those who keep the right,The king my sire still see the light.\"The queen, by Ráma thus addressed,Still with a mother grief oppressed,While her long eyes with tears were dim,Began once more and answered him:\"Not by my pleading may be stayedThe firm resolve thy soul has made.My hero, thou wilt go; and noneThe stern commands of Fate may shun.Go forth, dear child whom naught can bend,And may all bliss thy steps attend.Thou wilt return, and that dear dayWill chase mine every grief away.Thou wilt return, thy duty done,Thy vows discharged, high glory won;From filial debt wilt thou be free,And sweetest joy will come on me.My son, the will of mighty FateAt every time must dominate,If now it drives thee hence to strayHeedless of me who bid thee stay.Go, strong of arm, go forth, my boy,Go forth, again to come with joy,And thine expectant mother cheerWith those sweet tones she loves to hear.O that the blessed hour were nighWhen thou shalt glad this anxious eye,With matted hair and hermit dressreturning from the wilderness.\"Kausalyá conscious soul approved,As her proud glance she bentOn Ráma constant and unmoved,Resolved on banishment.Such words, with happy omens fraughtTo her dear son she said,Invoking with each eager thoughtA blessing on his head.Canto XXV. Kausalyá Blessing.Her grief and woe she cast aside,Her lips with water purified,And thus her benison beganThat mother of the noblest man:\"If thou wilt hear no words of mine,Go forth, thou pride of Raghu line.Go, darling, and return with speed,Walking where noble spirits lead.May virtue on thy steps attend,And be her faithful lover friend.May Those to whom thy vows are paidIn temple and in holy shade,With all the mighty saints combineTo keep that precious life of thine.The arms wise Visvámitra(292) gaveThy virtuous soul from danger save.Long be thy life: thy sure defenceShall be thy truthful innocence,And that obedience, naught can tire,To me thy mother and thy sire.May fanes where holy fires are fed,Altars with grass and fuel spread,Each sacrificial ground, each tree,Rock, lake, and mountain, prosper thee.Let old Viráj,(293) and Him who madeThe universe, combine to aid;Let Indra and each guardian LordWho keeps the worlds, their help afford,And be thy constant friend the Sun,Lord Púshá, Bhaga, Aryuman.(294)Fortnights and seasons, nights and days,Years, months, and hours, protect thy ways,Vrihaspati shall still be nigh,The War-God, and the Moon on high,And Nárad(295) and the sainted seven(296)Shall watch thee from their starry heaven.The mountains, and the seas which ringThe world, and Varuna the King,Sky, ether, and the wind, whate\\'erMoves not or moves, for thee shall care.Each lunar mansion be benign,With happier light the planets shine;All gods, each light in heaven that glows,Protect my child where\\'er he goes.The twilight hours, the day and night,Keep in the wood thy steps aright.Watch, minute, instant, as they flee,Shall all bring happiness to thee.Celestials and the Titan broodProtect thee in thy solitude,And haunt the mighty wood to blessThe wanderer in his hermit dress.Fear not, by mightier guardians screened,The giant or night-roving fiend;Nor let the cruel race who tearMan flesh for food thy bosom scare.Far be the ape, the scorpion sting,Fly, gnat, and worm, and creeping thing.Thee shall the hungry lion spare,The tiger, elephant, and bear:Safe, from their furious might repose,Safe from the horned buffaloes.Each savage thing the forests breed,That love on human flesh to feed,Shall for my child its rage abate,When thus its wrath I deprecate.Blest be thy ways: may sweet successThe valour of my darling bless.To all that Fortune can bestow,Go forth, my child, my Ráma, go.Go forth, O happy in the loveOf all the Gods below, above;And in those guardian powers confideThy paths who keep, thy steps who guide.May Sukra,(297) Yáma, Sun, and Moon,And He who gives each golden boon,(298)Won by mine earnest prayers, be goodTo thee, my son, in Dandak wood.Fire, wind, and smoke, each text and spellFrom mouths of holy seers that fell,Guard Ráma when his limbs he dips,Or with the stream makes pure his lips!May the great saints and He, the LordWho made the worlds, by worlds adored,And every God in heaven besideMy banished Ráma keep and guide.\"Thus with due praise the long-eyed dame,Ennobled by her spotless fame,With wreaths of flowers and precious scentWorshipped the Gods, most reverent.A high-souled Bráhman lit the fire,And offered, at the queen desire,The holy oil ordained to burnFor Ráma weal and safe return.Kausalyá best of dames, with careSet oil, wreaths, fuel, mustard, there.Then when the rites of fire had ceased,For Ráma bliss and health, the priest,Standing without gave what remainedIn general offering,(299) as ordained.Dealing among the twice-horn trainHoney, and curds, and oil, and grain,He bade each heart and voice uniteTo bless the youthful anchorite.Then Ráma mother, glorious dameBestowed, to meet the Bráhman claim,A lordly fee for duty done:And thus again addressed her son:\"Such blessings as the Gods o\\'erjoyedPoured forth, when Vritra(300) was destroyed,On Indra of the thousand eyes,Attend, my child, thine enterprise!Yea, such as Vinatá once gaveTo King Suparna(301) swift and brave,Who sought the drink that cheers the skies,Attend, my child, thine enterprise!Yea, such as, when the Amrit rose,(302)And Indra slew his Daitya foes,The royal Aditi bestowedOn Him whose hand with slaughter glowedOf that dire brood of monstrous size,Attend, my child, thine enterprise!E\\'en such as peerless Vishnu graced,When with his triple step he paced,Outbursting from the dwarf disguise,(303)Attend, my child, thine enterprise!Floods, isles, and seasons as they fly,Worlds, Vedas, quarters of the sky,Combine, O mighty-armed, to blessThee destined heir of happiness!\"The long-eyed lady ceased: she shedPure scent and grain upon his head.And that prized herb whose sovereign powerPreserves from dark misfortune hour,Upon the hero arm she set,To be his faithful amulet.While holy texts she murmured low,And spoke glad words though crushed by woe,Concealing with obedient tongueThe pangs with which her heart was wrung.She bent, she kissed his brow, she pressedHer darling to her troubled breast:\"Firm in thy purpose, go,\" she cried,\"Go Ráma, and may bliss betide.Attain returning safe and well,Triumphant in Ayodhyá, dwell.Then shall my happy eyes beholdThe empire by thy will controlled.Then grief and care shall leave no trace,Joy shall light up thy mother face,And I shall see my darling reign,In moonlike glory come again.These eyes shall fondly gaze on theeSo faithful to thy sire decree,When thou the forest wild shalt quitOn thine ancestral throne to sit.Yea, thou shalt turn from exile back,Nor choicest blessings ever lack,Then fill with rapture ever newMy bosom and thy consort too.To Siva and the heavenly hostMy worship has been paid,To mighty saint, to godlike ghost,To every wandering shade.Forth to the forest thou wilt hie,Therein to dwell so long:Let all the quarters of the skyProtect my child from wrong.\"Her blessings thus the queen bestowed;Then round him fondly paced,And often, while her eyes o\\'erflowed,Her dearest son embraced.Kausalyá honoured feet he pressed,As round her steps she bent,And radiant with her prayers that blessed,To Sítá home he went.Canto XXVI. Alone With Sítá.So Ráma, to his purpose true,To Queen Kausalyá bade adieu,Received the benison she gave,And to the path of duty clave.As through the crowded street he passed,A radiance on the way he cast,And each fair grace, by all approved,The bosoms of the people moved.Now of the woeful change no wordThe fair Videhan bride had heard;The thought of that imperial riteStill filled her bosom with delight.With grateful heart and joyful thoughtThe Gods in worship she had sought,And, well in royal duties learned,Sat longing till her lord returned,Not all unmarked by grief and shameWithin his sumptuous home he came,And hurried through the happy crowdWith eye dejected, gloomy-browed.Up Sítá sprang, and every limbTrembled with fear at sight of him.She marked that cheek where anguish fed,Those senses care-disquieted.For, when he looked on her, no moreCould his heart hide the load it bore,Nor could the pious chief controlThe paleness o\\'er his cheek that stole.His altered cheer, his brow bedewedWith clammy drops, his grief she viewed,And cried, consumed with fires of woe,\"What, O my lord, has changed thee so?Vrihaspati looks down benign,And the moon rests in Pushya sign,As Bráhmans sage this day declare:Then whence, my lord, this grief and care?Why does no canopy, like foamFor its white beauty, shade thee home,Its hundred ribs spread wide to throwSplendour on thy fair head below?Where are the royal fans, to graceThe lotus beauty of thy face,Fair as the moon or wild-swan wing,And waving round the new-made king?Why do no sweet-toned bards rejoiceTo hail thee with triumphant voice?No tuneful heralds love to raiseLoud music in their monarch praise?Why do no Bráhmans, Scripture-read,Pour curds and honey on thy head,Anointed, as the laws ordain,With holy rites, supreme to reign?Where are the chiefs of every guild?Where are the myriads should have filledThe streets, and followed home their kingWith merry noise and triumphing?Why does no gold-wrought chariot leadWith four brave horses, best for speed?No elephant precede the crowdLike a huge hill or thunder cloud,Marked from his birth for happy fate,Whom signs auspicious decorate?Why does no henchman, young and fair,Precede thee, and delight to bearEntrusted to his reverent holdThe burthen of thy throne of gold?Why, if the consecrating riteBe ready, why this mournful plight?Why do I see this sudden change,This altered mien so sad and strange?\"To her, as thus she weeping cried,Raghu illustrious son replied:\"Sítá, my honoured sire decreeCommands me to the woods to flee.O high-born lady, nobly bredIn the good paths thy footsteps tread,Hear, Janak daughter, while I tellThe story as it all befell.Of old my father true and braveTwo boons to Queen Kaikeyí gave.Through these the preparations madeFor me to-day by her are stayed,For he is bound to disallowThis promise by that earlier vow.In Dandak forest wild and vastMust fourteen years by me be passed.My father will makes Bharat heir,The kingdom and the throne to share.Now, ere the lonely wild I seek,I come once more with thee to speak.In Bharat presence, O my dame,Ne\\'er speak with pride of Ráma name:Another eulogy to hearIs hateful to a monarch ear.Thou must with love his rule obeyTo whom my father yields the sway.With love and sweet observance learnHis grace, and more the king, to earn.Now, that my father may not breakThe words of promise that he spake,To the drear wood my steps are bent:Be firm, good Sítá, and content.Through all that time, my blameless spouse,Keep well thy fasts and holy vows.Rise from thy bed at break of day,And to the Gods due worship pay.With meek and lowly love revereThe lord of men, my father dear,And reverence to Kausalyá show,My mother, worn with eld and woe:By duty law, O best of dames,High worship from thy love she claims,Nor to the other queens refuseObservance, rendering each her dues:By love and fond attention shownThey are my mothers like mine own.Let Bharat and Satrughna bearIn thy sweet love a special share:Dear as my life, O let them beLike brother and like son to thee.In every word and deed refrainFrom aught that Bharat soul may pain:He is Ayodhyá king and mine,The head and lord of all our line.For those who serve and love them muchWith weariless endeavour, touchAnd win the gracious hearts of kings.While wrath from disobedience springs.Great monarchs from their presence sendTheir lawful sons who still offend,And welcome to the vacant placeGood children of an alien race.Then, best of women, rest thou here,And Bharat will with love revere.Obedient to thy king remain,And still thy vows of truth maintain.To the wide wood my steps I bend:Make thou thy dwelling here;See that thy conduct ne\\'er offend,And keep my words, my dear.\"Canto XXVII. Sítá Speech.His sweetly-speaking bride, who bestDeserved her lord, he thus addressed.Then tender love bade passion wake,And thus the fair Videhan spake:\"What words are these that thou hast said?Contempt of me the thought has bred.O best of heroes, I dismissWith bitter scorn a speech like this:Unworthy of a warrior fameIt taints a monarch son with shame,Ne\\'er to be heard from those who knowThe science of the sword and bow.My lord, the mother, sire, and sonReceive their lots by merit won;The brother and the daughter findThe portions to their deeds assigned.The wife alone, whate\\'er await,Must share on earth her husband fate.So now the king command which sendsThee to the wild, to me extends.The wife can find no refuge, none,In father, mother, self, or son:Both here, and when they vanish hence,Her husband is her sole defence.If, Raghu son, thy steps are ledWhere Dandak pathless wilds are spread,My foot before thine own shall passThrough tangled thorn and matted grass.Dismiss thine anger and thy doubt:Like refuse water cast them out,And lead me, O my hero, hence--I know not sin--with confidence.Whate\\'er his lot, \\'tis far more sweetTo follow still a husband feetThan in rich palaces to lie,Or roam at pleasure through the sky.My mother and my sire have taughtWhat duty bids, and trained each thought,Nor have I now mine ear to turnThe duties of a wife to learn.I\\'ll seek with thee the woodland dellAnd pathless wild where no men dwell,Where tribes of silvan creatures roam,And many a tiger makes his home.My life shall pass as pleasant thereAs in my father palace fair.The worlds shall wake no care in me;My only care be truth to thee.There while thy wish I still obey,True to my vows with thee I\\'ll stray,And there shall blissful hours be spentIn woods with honey redolent.In forest shades thy mighty armWould keep a stranger life from harm,And how shall Sítá think of fearWhen thou, O glorious lord, art near?Heir of high bliss, my choice is made,Nor can I from my will be stayed.Doubt not; the earth will yield me roots,These will I eat, and woodland fruits;And as with thee I wander thereI will not bring thee grief or care.I long, when thou, wise lord, art nigh,All fearless, with delighted eyeTo gaze upon the rocky hill,The lake, the fountain, and the rill;To sport with thee, my limbs to cool,In some pure lily-covered pool,While the white swan and mallard wingsAre plashing in the water-springs.So would a thousand seasons fleeLike one sweet day, if spent with thee.Without my lord I would not prizeA home with Gods above the skies:Without my lord, my life to bless,Where could be heaven or happiness?Forbid me not: with thee I goThe tangled wood to tread.There will I live with thee, as thoughThis roof were o\\'er my head.My will for thine shall be resigned;Thy feet my steps shall guide.Thou, only thou, art in my mind:I heed not all beside.Thy heart shall ne\\'er by me be grieved;Do not my prayer deny:Take me, dear lord; of thee bereavedThy Sítá swears to die.\"These words the duteous lady spake,Nor would he yet consentHis faithful wife with him to takeTo share his banishment.He soothed her with his gentle speech;To change her will he strove;And much he said the woes to teachOf those in wilds who rove.Canto XXVIII. The Dangers Of The Wood.Thus Sítá spake, and he who knewHis duty, to its orders true,Was still reluctant as the woesOf forest life before him rose.He sought to soothe her grief, to dryThe torrent from each brimming eye,And then, her firm resolve to shake,These words the pious hero spake:\"O daughter of a noble line,Whose steps from virtue ne\\'er decline,Remain, thy duties here pursue,As my fond heart would have thee do.Now hear me, Sítá, fair and weak,And do the words that I shall speak.Attend and hear while I explainEach danger in the wood, each pain.Thy lips have spoken: I condemnThe foolish words that fell from them.This senseless plan, this wish of thineTo live a forest life, resign.The names of trouble and distressSuit well the tangled wilderness.In the wild wood no joy I know,A forest life is nought but woe.The lion in his mountain caveAnswers the torrents as they rave,And forth his voice of terror throws:The wood, my love, is full of woes.There mighty monsters fearless play,And in their maddened onset slayThe hapless wretch who near them goes:The wood, my love, is full of woes.\\'Tis hard to ford each treacherous flood,So thick with crocodiles and mud,Where the wild elephants repose:The wood, my love, is full of woes.Or far from streams the wanderer straysThrough thorns and creeper-tangled ways,While round him many a wild-cock crows:The wood, my love, is full of woes.On the cold ground upon a heapOf gathered leaves condemned to sleep,Toil-wearied, will his eyelids close:The wood, my love, is full of woes.Long days and nights must he contentHis soul with scanty aliment,What fruit the wind from branches blows:The wood, my love, is full of woes.O Sítá, while his strength may last,The ascetic in the wood must fast,Coil on his head his matted hair,And bark must be his only wear.To Gods and spirits day by dayThe ordered worship he must pay,And honour with respectful careEach wandering guest who meets him there.The bathing rites he ne\\'er must shunAt dawn, at noon, at set of sun,Obedient to the law he knows:The wood, my love, is full of woes.To grace the altar must be broughtThe gift of flowers his hands have sought--The debt each pious hermit owes:The wood, my love, is full of woes.The devotee must be contentTo live, severely abstinent,On what the chance of fortune shows:The wood, my love, is full of woes.Hunger afflicts him evermore:The nights are black, the wild winds roar;And there are dangers worse than those:The wood, my love, is full of woes.There creeping things in every formInfest the earth, the serpents swarm,And each proud eye with fury glows:The wood, my love, is full of woes.The snakes that by the rives hideIn sinuous course like rivers glide,And line the path with deadly foes:The wood, my love, is full of woes.Scorpions, and grasshoppers, and fliesDisturb the wanderer as he lies,And wake him from his troubled doze:The wood, my love, is full of woes.Trees, thorny bushes, intertwined,Their branched ends together bind,And dense with grass the thicket grows:The wood, my dear, is full of woes,With many ills the flesh is tried,When these and countless fears besideVex those who in the wood remain:The wilds are naught but grief and pain.Hope, anger must be cast aside,To penance every thought applied:No fear must be of things to fear:Hence is the wood for ever drear.Enough, my love: thy purpose quit:For forest life thou art not fit.As thus I think on all, I seeThe wild wood is no place for thee.\"Canto XXIX. Sítá Appeal.Thus Ráma spake. Her lord addressThe lady heard with deep distress,And, as the tear bedimmed her eye,In soft low accents made reply:\"The perils of the wood, and allThe woes thou countest to appal,Led by my love I deem not pain;Each woe a charm, each loss a gain.Tiger, and elephant, and deer,Bull, lion, buffalo, in fear,Soon as thy matchless form they see,With every silvan beast will flee.With thee, O Ráma, I must go:My sire command ordains it so.Bereft of thee, my lonely heartMust break, and life and I must part.While thou, O mighty lord, art nigh,Not even He who rules the sky,Though He is strongest of the strong,With all his might can do me wrong.Nor can a lonely woman leftBy her dear husband live bereft.In my great love, my lord, I ween,The truth of this thou mayst have seen.In my sire palace long agoI heard the chief of those who know,The truth-declaring Bráhmans, tellMy fortune, in the wood to dwell.I heard their promise who divineThe future by each mark and sign,And from that hour have longed to leadThe forest life their lips decreed.Now, mighty Ráma, I must shareThy father doom which sends thee there;In this I will not be denied,But follow, love, where thou shalt guide.O husband, I will go with thee,Obedient to that high decree.Now let the Bráhmans\\' words be true,For this the time they had in view.I know full well the wood has woes;But they disturb the lives of thoseWho in the forest dwell, nor holdTheir rebel senses well controlled.In my sire halls, ere I was wed,I heard a dame who begged her breadBefore my mother face relateWhat griefs a forest life await.And many a time in sport I prayedTo seek with thee the greenwood shade,For O, my heart on this is set,To follow thee, dear anchoret.May blessings on thy life attend:I long with thee my steps to bend,For with such hero as thou artThis pilgrimage enchants my heart.Still close, my lord, to thy dear sideMy spirit will be purified:Love from all sin my soul will free:My husband is a God to me.So, love, with thee shall I have blissAnd share the life that follows this.I heard a Bráhman, dear to fame,This ancient Scripture text proclaim:\"The woman whom on earth belowHer parents on a man bestow,And lawfully their hands uniteWith water and each holy rite,She in this world shall be his wife,His also in the after life.\"Then tell me, O beloved, whyThou wilt this earnest prayer deny,Nor take me with thee to the wood,Thine own dear wife so true and good.But if thou wilt not take me thereThus grieving in my wild despair,To fire or water I will fly,Or to the poisoned draught, and die.\"So thus to share his exile, sheBesought him with each earnest plea,Nor could she yet her lord persuadeTo take her to the lonely shade.The answer of the strong-armed chiefSmote the Videhan soul with grief,And from her eyes the torrents camebathing the bosom of the dame.Canto XXX. The Triumph Of Love.The daughter of Videha king,While Ráma strove to soothe the stingOf her deep anguish, thus beganOnce more in furtherance of her plan:And with her spirit sorely triedBy fear and anger, love and pride,With keenly taunting words addressedHer hero of the stately breast:\"Why did the king my sire, who reignsO\\'er fair Videha wide domains,Hail Ráma son with joy unwise,A woman in a man disguise?Now falsely would the people say,By idle fancies led astray,That Ráma own are power and might,As glorious as the Lord of Light.Why sinkest thou in such dismay?What fears upon thy spirit weigh,That thou, O Ráma, fain wouldst fleeFrom her who thinks of naught but thee?To thy dear will am I resignedIn heart and body, soul and mind,As Sávitrí gave all to one,Satyaván, Dyumatsena son.(304)Not e\\'en in fancy can I brookTo any guard save thee to look:Let meaner wives their houses shame,To go with thee is all my claim.Like some low actor, deemst thou fitThy wife to others to commit--Thine own, espoused in maiden youth,Thy wife so long, unblamed for truth?Do thou, my lord, his will obeyFor whom thou losest royal sway,To whom thou wouldst thy wife confide--Not me, but thee, his wish may guide.Thou must not here thy wife forsake,And to the wood thy journey make,Whether stern penance, grief, and care,Or rule or heaven await thee there.Nor shall fatigue my limbs distressWhen wandering in the wilderness:Each path which near to thee I treadShall seem a soft luxurious bed.The reeds, the bushes where I pass,The thorny trees, the tangled grassShall feel, if only thou be near,Soft to my touch as skins of deer.When the rude wind in fury blows,And scattered dust upon me throws,That dust, beloved lord, to meShall as the precious sandal be.And what shall be more blest than I,When gazing on the wood I lieIn some green glade upon a bedWith sacred grass beneath us spread?The root, the leaf, the fruit which thouShalt give me from the earth or bough,Scanty or plentiful, to eat,Shall taste to me as Amrit sweet.As there I live on flowers and rootsAnd every season kindly fruits,I will not for my mother grieve,My sire, my home, or all I leave.My presence, love, shall never addOne pain to make the heart more sad;I will not cause thee grief or care,Nor be a burden hard to bear.With thee is heaven, where\\'er the spot;Each place is hell where thou art not.Then go with me, O Ráma; thisIs all my hope and all my bliss.If thou wilt leave thy wife who stillEntreats thee with undaunted will,This very day shall poison closeThe life that spurns the rule of foes.How, after, can my soul sustainThe bitter life of endless pain,When thy dear face, my lord, I miss?No, death is better far than this.Not for an hour could I endureThe deadly grief that knows not cure,Far less a woe I could not shunFor ten long years, and three, and one.\"While fires of woe consumed her, suchHer sad appeal, lamenting much;Then with a wild cry, anguish-wrung,About her husband neck she clung.Like some she-elephant who bleedsStruck by the hunter venomed reeds,So in her quivering heart she feltThe many wounds his speeches dealt.Then, as the spark from wood is gained,(305)Down rolled the tear so long restrained:The crystal moisture, sprung from woe,From her sweet eyes began to flow,As runs the water from a pairOf lotuses divinely fair.And Sítá face with long dark eyes,Pure as the moon of autumn skies,Faded with weeping, as the budsOf lotuses when sink the floods.Around his wife his arms he strained,Who senseless from her woe remained,And with sweet words, that bade her wakeTo life again, the hero spake:\"I would not with thy woe, my Queen,Buy heaven and all its blissful sheen.Void of all fear am I as He,The self-existent God, can be.I knew not all thy heart till now,Dear lady of the lovely brow,So wished not thee in woods to dwell;Yet there mine arm can guard thee well.Now surely thou, dear love, wast madeTo dwell with me in green wood shade.And, as a high saint tender mindClings to its love for all mankind,So I to thee will ever cling,Sweet daughter of Videha king.The good, of old, O soft of frame,Honoured this duty sovereign claim,And I its guidance will not shun,True as light Queen is to the Sun.I cannot, pride of Janak line,This journey to the wood decline:My sire behest, the oath he sware,The claims of truth, all lead me there.One duty, dear the same for aye,Is sire and mother to obey:Should I their orders once transgressMy very life were weariness.If glad obedience be deniedTo father, mother, holy guide,What rites, what service can be doneThat stern Fate favour may be won?These three the triple world comprise,O darling of the lovely eyes.Earth has no holy thing like theseWhom with all love men seek to please.Not truth, or gift, or bended knee,Not honour, worship, lordly fee,Storms heaven and wins a blessing thenceLike sonly love and reverence.Heaven, riches, grain, and varied lore,With sons and many a blessing more,All these are made their own with easeBy those their elders\\' souls who please.The mighty-souled, who ne\\'er forget,Devoted sons, their filial debt,Win worlds where Gods and minstrels are,And Brahmá sphere more glorious far.Now as the orders of my sire,Who keeps the way of truth, require,So will I do, for such the wayOf duty that endures for aye:To take thee, love, to Dandak wildMy heart at length is reconciled,For thee such earnest thoughts impelTo follow, and with me to dwell.O faultless form from feet to brows,Come with me, as my will allows,And duty there with me pursue,Trembler, whose bright eyes thrill me through.In all thy days, come good come ill,Preserve unchanged such noble will,And thou, dear love, wilt ever beThe glory of thy house and me.Now, beauteous-armed, begin the tasksThe woodland life of hermits asks.For me the joys of heaven aboveHave charms no more without thee, love.And now, dear Sítá, be not slow:Food on good mendicants bestow,And for the holy Bráhmans bringThy treasures and each precious thing.Thy best attire and gems collect,The jewels which thy beauty decked,And every ornament and toyPrepared for hours of sport and joy:The beds, the cars wherein I ride,Among our followers, next, divide.\"She conscious that her lord approvedHer going, with great rapture moved,Hastened within, without delay,Prepared to give their wealth away.Canto XXXI. Lakshman Prayer.When Lakshman, who had joined them there,Had heard the converse of the pair,His mien was changed, his eyes o\\'erflowed,His breast no more could bear its load.The son of Raghu, sore distressed,His brother feet with fervour pressed,While thus to Sítá he complained,And him by lofty vows enchained:\"If thou wilt make the woods thy home,Where elephant and roebuck roam,I too this day will take my bowAnd in the path before thee go.Our way will lie through forest groundWhere countless birds and beasts are found,I heed not homes of Gods on high,I heed not life that cannot die,Nor would I wish, with thee away,O\\'er the three worlds to stretch my sway.\"Thus Lakshman spake, with earnest prayerHis brother woodland life to share.As Ráma still his prayer deniedWith soothing words, again he cried:\"When leave at first thou didst accord,Why dost thou stay me now, my lord?Thou art my refuge: O, be kind,Leave me not, dear my lord, behind.Thou canst not, brother, if thou chooseThat I still live, my wish refuse.\"The glorious chief his speech renewedTo faithful Lakshman as he sued,And on the eyes of Ráma gazedLonging to lead, with hands upraised:\"Thou art a hero just and dear,Whose steps to virtue path adhere,Loved as my life till life shall end,My faithful brother and my friend.If to the woods thou take thy wayWith Sítá and with me to-day,Who for Kausalyá will provide,And guard the good Sumitrá side?The lord of earth, of mighty power,Who sends good things in plenteous shower,As Indra pours the grateful rain,A captive lies in passion chain.The power imperial for her sonHas Asvapati daughter(306) won,And she, proud queen, will little heedHer miserable rivals\\' need.So Bharat, ruler of the land,By Queen Kaikeyí side will stand,Nor of those two will ever think,While grieving in despair they sink.Now, Lakshman, as thy love decrees,Or else the monarch heart to please,Follow this counsel and protectMy honoured mother from neglect.So thou, while not to me aloneThy great affection will be shown,To highest duty wilt adhereBy serving those thou shouldst revere.Now, son of Raghu, for my sakeObey this one request I make,Or, of her darling son bereft,Kausalyá has no comfort left.\"The faithful Lakshman, thus addressedIn gentle words which love expressed,To him in lore of language learned,His answer, eloquent, returned:\"Nay, through thy might each queen will shareAttentive Bharat love and care,Should Bharat, raised as king to swayThis noblest realm, his trust betray,Nor for their safety well provide,Seduced by ill-suggesting pride,Doubt not my vengeful hand shall killThe cruel wretch who counsels ill--Kill him and all who lend him aid,And the three worlds in league arrayed.And good Kausalyá well can feeA thousand champions like to me.A thousand hamlets rich in grainThe station of that queen maintain.She may, and my dear mother too,Live on the ample revenue.Then let me follow thee: herein:Is naught that may resemble sin.So shall I in my wish succeed,And aid, perhaps, my brother need.My bow and quiver well suppliedWith arrows hanging at my side,My hands shall spade and basket bear,And for thy feet the way prepare.I\\'ll bring thee roots and berries sweet.And woodland fare which hermits eat.Thou shall with thy Videhan spouseRecline upon the mountain brows;Be mine the toil, be mine to keepWatch o\\'er thee waking or asleep.\"Filled by his speech with joy and pride,Ráma to Lakshman thus replied:\"Go then, my brother, bid adieuTo all thy friends and retinue.And those two bows of fearful might,Celestial, which, at that famed rite,Lord Varun gave to Janak, kingOf fair Vedeha with thee bring,With heavenly coats of sword-proof mail,Quivers, whose arrows never fail,And golden-hilted swords so keen,The rivals of the sun in sheen.Tended with care these arms are allPreserved in my preceptor hall.With speed, O Lakshman, go, produce,And bring them hither for our use.\"So on a woodland life intent,To see his faithful friends he went,And brought the heavenly arms which layBy Ráma teacher stored away.And Raghu son to Ráma showedThose wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,Well kept, adorned with many a wreathOf flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath.The prudent Ráma at the sightAddressed his brother with delight:\"Well art thou come, my brother dear,For much I longed to see thee here.For with thine aid, before I go,I would my gold and wealth bestowUpon the Bráhmans sage, who schoolTheir lives by stern devotion rule.And for all those who ever dwellWithin my house and serve me well,Devoted servants, true and good,Will I provide a livelihood.Quick, go and summon to this placeThe good Vasishtha son,Suyajna, of the Bráhman raceThe first and holiest one.To all the Bráhmans wise and goodWill I due reverence pay,Then to the solitary woodWith thee will take my way.\"Canto XXXII. The Gift Of The Treasures.That speech so noble which conveyedHis friendly wish, the chief obeyed,With steps made swift by anxious thoughtThe wise Suyajna home he sought.Him in the hall of Fire(307) he found,And bent before him to the ground:\"O friend, to Ráma house return,Who now performs a task most stern.\"He, when his noonday rites were done,Went forth with fair Sumitrá son,And came to Ráma bright abodeRich in the love which Lakshmí showed.The son of Raghu, with his dame,With joined hands met him as he came,Showing to him who Scripture knewThe worship that is Agni due.With armlets, bracelets, collars, rings,With costly pearls on golden strings,With many a gem for neck and limbThe son of Raghu honoured him.Then Ráma, at his wife request,The wise Suyajna thus addressed:\"Accept a necklace too to deckWith golden strings thy spouse neck.And Sítá here, my friend, were gladA girdle to her gift to add.And many a bracelet wrought with care,And many an armlet rich and rare,My wife to thine is fain to give,Departing in the wood to live.A bed by skilful workmen made,With gold and various gems inlaid--This too, before she goes, would shePresent, O saintly friend, to thee.Thine be my elephant, so famed,My uncle present, Victor named;And let a thousand coins of gold,Great Bráhman, with the gift be told.\"Thus Ráma spoke: nor he declinedThe noble gifts for him designed.On Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá heInvoked all high felicity.In pleasant words then Ráma gaveHis best to Lakshman prompt and brave,As Brahmá speaks for Him to hearWho rules the Gods\\' celestial sphere:\"To the two best of Bráhmans run;Agastya bring, and Kusik son,And precious gifts upon them rain,Like fostering floods upon the grain.O long-armed Prince of Raghu line,Delight them with a thousand kine,And many a fair and costly gem,With gold and silver, give to them.To him, so deep in Scripture, who,To Queen Kausalyá, ever true,Serves her with blessing and respect,Chief of the Taittiríya sect(308)--To him, with women-slaves, presentA chariot rich with ornament,And costly robes of silk beside,Until the sage be satisfied.On Chitraratha, true and dear,My tuneful bard and charioteer,Gems, robes, and plenteous wealth confer--Mine ancient friend and minister.And these who go with staff in hand,Grammarians trained, a numerous band,Who their deep study only prize,Nor think of other exercise,Who toil not, loving dainty fare,Whose praises e\\'en the good declare--On these be eighty cars bestowed,And each with precious treasures load.A thousand bulls for them suffice,Two hundred elephants of price,And let a thousand kine besideThe dainties of each meal provide.The throng who sacred girdles wear,And on Kausalyá wait with care--A thousand golden coins shall please,Son of Sumitrá, each of these.Let all, dear Lakshman of the trainThese special gifts of honour gain:My mother will rejoice to knowHer Bráhmans have been cherished so.\"Then Raghu son addressed the crowdWho round him stood and wept aloud,When he to all who thronged the courtHad dealt his wealth for their support:\"In Lakshman house and mine remain,And guard them till I come again.\"To all his people sad with grief,In loving words thus spoke their chief,Then bade his treasure-keeper bringGold, silver, and each precious thing.Then straight the servants went and boreBack to their chief the wealth in store.Before the people eyes it shone,A glorious pile to look upon.The prince of men with Lakshman aidParted the treasures there displayed,Gave to the poor, the young, the old,And twice-born men, the gems and gold.A Bráhman, long in evil case,Named Trijat, born of Garga race,Earned ever toiling in a woodWith spade and plough his livelihood.The youthful wife, his babes who bore,Their indigence felt more and more.Thus to the aged man she spake:\"Hear this my word: my counsel take.Come, throw thy spade and plough away;To virtuous Ráma go to-day,And somewhat of his kindness pray.\"He heard the words she spoke: aroundHis limbs his ragged cloth he wound,And took his journey by the roadThat led to Ráma fair abode.To the fifth court he made his way;Nor met the Bráhman check or stay.Brighu, Angiras(309) could not beBrighter with saintly light than he.To Ráma presence on he pressed,And thus the noble chief addressed:\"O Ráma, poor and weak am I,And many children round me cry.Scant living in the woods I earn:On me thine eye of pity turn.\"And Ráma, bent on sport and jest,The suppliant Bráhman thus addressed:\"O aged man, one thousand kine,Yet undistributed, are mine.The cows on thee will I bestowAs far as thou thy staff canst throw.\"The Bráhman heard. In eager hasteHe bound his cloth around his waist.Then round his head his staff he whirled,And forth with mightiest effort hurled.Cast from his hand it flew, and sankTo earth on Sarjú farther bank,Where herds of kine in thousands fedNear to the well-stocked bullock shed.And all the cows that wandered o\\'erThe meadow, far as Sarjú shore,At Ráma word the herdsmen droveTo Trijat cottage in the grove.He drew the Bráhman to his breast,And thus with calming words addressed:\"Now be not angry, Sire. I pray:This jest of mine was meant in play.These thousand kine, but not alone.Their herdsmen too, are all thine own.And wealth beside I give thee: speak,Thine shall be all thy heart can seek.\"Thus Ráma spake. And Trijat prayedFor means his sacrifice to aid.And Ráma gave much wealth, requiredTo speed his offering as desired.Canto XXXIII. The People Lament.Thus Sítá and the princes braveMuch wealth to all the Bráhmans gave.Then to the monarch house the threeWent forth the aged king to see.The princes from two servants tookThose heavenly arms of glorious look,Adorned with garland and with bandBy Sítá beautifying hand.On each high house a mournful throngHad gathered ere they passed along,Who gazed in pure unselfish woeFrom turret, roof, and portico.So dense the crowd that blocked the ways,The rest, unable there to gaze,Were fain each terrace to ascend,And thence their eyes on Ráma bend.Then as the gathered multitudeOn foot their well-loved Ráma viewed,No royal shade to screen his head,Such words, disturbed in grief, they said:\"O look, our hero, wont to rideLeading a host in perfect pride--Now Lakshman, sole of all his friends,With Sítá on his steps attends.Though he has known the sweets of power,And poured his gifts in liberal shower,From duty path he will not swerve,But, still his father truth preserve.And she whose form so soft and fairWas veiled from spirits of the air,Now walks unsheltered from the day,Seen by the crowds who throng the way.Ah, for that gently-nurtured form!How will it fade with sun and storm!How will the rain, the cold, the heatMar fragrant breast and tinted feet!Surely some demon has possessedHis sire, and speaks within his breast,Or how could one that is a kingThus send his dear son wandering?It were a deed unkindly doneTo banish e\\'en a worthless son:But what, when his pure life has gainedThe hearts of all, by love enchained?Six sovereign virtues join to graceRáma the foremost of his race:Tender and kind and pure is he,Docile, religious, passion-free.Hence misery strikes not him alone:In bitterest grief the people moan,Like creatures of the stream, when dryIn the great heat the channels lie.The world is mournful with the griefThat falls on its beloved chief,As, when the root is hewn away,Tree, fruit, and flower, and bud decay.The soul of duty, bright to see,He is the root of you and me;And all of us, who share his grief,His branches, blossom, fruit, and leaf.Now like the faithful Lakshman, weWill follow and be true as he;Our wives and kinsmen call with speed,And hasten where our lord shall lead.Yes, we will leave each well-loved spot,The field, the garden, and the cot,And, sharers of his weal and woe,Behind the pious Ráma go.Our houses, empty of their stores,With ruined courts and broken doors,With all their treasures borne away.And gear that made them bright and gay:O\\'errun by rats, with dust o\\'erspread,Shrines, whence the deities have fled,Where not a hand the water pours,Or sweeps the long-neglected floors,No incense loads the evening air,No Bráhmans chant the text and prayer,No fire of sacrifice is bright,No gift is known, no sacred rite;With floors which broken vessels strew,As if our woes had crushed them too--Of these be stern Kaikeyí queen,And rule o\\'er homes where we have been.The wood where Ráma feet may roamShall be our city and our home,And this fair city we forsake,Our flight a wilderness shall make.Each serpent from his hole shall hie,The birds and beasts from mountain fly,Lions and elephants in fearShall quit the woods when we come near,Yield the broad wilds for us to range,And take our city in exchange.With Ráma will we hence, contentIf, where he is, our days be spent.\"Such were the varied words the crowdOf all conditions spoke aloud.And Ráma heard their speeches, yetChanged not his purpose firmly set.His father palace soon he neared,That like Kailása hill appeared.Like a wild elephant he strodeRight onward to the bright abode.Within the palace court he stepped,Where ordered bands their station kept,And saw Sumantra standing nearWith down-cast eye and gloomy cheer.Canto XXXIV. Ráma In The Palace.The dark incomparable chiefWhose eye was like a lotus leaf,Cried to the mournful charioteer,\"Go tell my sire that I am here.\"Sumantra, sad and all dismayed,The chieftain order swift obeyed.Within the palace doors he hiedAnd saw the king, who wept and sighed.Like the great sun when wrapped in shadeLike fire by ashes overlaid,Or like a pool with waters dried,So lay the world great lord and pride,A while the wise Sumantra gazedOn him whose senses woe has dazed,Grieving for Ráma. Near he drewWith hands upraised in reverence due.With blessing first his king he hailed;Then with a voice that well-nigh failed,In trembling accents soft and lowAddressed the monarch in his woe:\"The prince of men, thy Ráma, waitsBefore thee at the palace gates.His wealth to Bráhmans he has dealt,And all who in his home have dwelt.Admit thy son. His friends have heardHis kind farewell and parting word,He longs to see thee first, and thenWill seek the wilds, O King of men.He, with each princely virtue blaze,Shines as the sun engirt by rays.\"The truthful King who loved to keepThe law profound as Ocean deep,And stainless as the dark blue sky,Thus to Sumantra made reply:\"Go then, Sumantra, go and callMy wives and ladies one and all.Drawn round me shall they fill the placeWhen I behold my Ráma face.\"Quick to the inner rooms he sped,And thus to all the women said,\"Come, at the summons of the king:Come all, and make no tarrying.\"Their husband word, by him conveyed,Soon as they heard, the dames obeyed,And following his guidance allCame thronging to the regal hall.In number half seven hundred, they,All lovely dames, in long array,With their bright eyes for weeping red,To stand round Queen Kausalyá, sped.They gathered, and the monarch viewedOne moment all the multitude,Then to Sumantra spoke and said:\"Now let my son be hither led.\"Sumantra went. Then Ráma came,And Lakshman, and the Maithil dame,And, as he led them on, their guideStraight to the monarch presence hied.When yet far off the father sawHis son with raised palms toward him draw,Girt by his ladies, sick with woes,Swift from his royal seat he rose.With all his strength the aged manTo meet his darling Ráma ran,But trembling, wild with dark despair,Fell on the ground and fainted there.And Lakshman, wont in cars to ride,And Ráma, threw them by the sideOf the poor miserable king,Half lifeless with his sorrow sting.Throughout the spacious hall up wentA thousand women wild lament:\"Ah Ráma!\" thus they wailed and wept,And anklets tinkled as they steppedAround his body, weeping, threwTheir loving arms the brothers two,And then, with Sítá gentle aid,The king upon a couch was laid.At length to earth imperial lord,When life and knowledge were restored,Though seas of woe went o\\'er his head,With suppliant hand, thus Ráma said:\"Lord of us all, great King, thou art:Bid me farewell before we part,To Dandak wood this day I go:One blessing and one look bestow.Let Lakshman my companion be,And Sítá also follow me.With truthful pleas I sought to bendTheir purpose; but no ear they lend.Now cast this sorrow from thy heart,And let us all, great King, depart.As Brahmá sends his children, soLet Lakshman, me, and Sítá go.\"He stood unmoved, and watched intentUntil the king should grant consent.Upon his son his eyes he cast,And thus the monarch spake at last:\"O Ráma, by her arts enslaved,I gave the boons Kaikeyí craved,Unfit to reign, by her misled:Be ruler in thy father stead.\"Thus by the lord of men addressed,Ráma, of virtue friends the best,In lore of language duly learned,His answer, reverent, thus returned:\"A thousand years, O King, remainO\\'er this our city still to reign.I in the woods my life will lead:The lust of rule no more I heed.Nine years and five I there will spend,And when the portioned days shall end,Will come, my vows and exile o\\'er,And clasp thy feet, my King, once more.\"A captive in the snare of truth,Weeping, distressed with woe and ruth,Thus spake the monarch, while the queenKaikeyí urged him on unseen:\"Go then, O Ráma, and beginThy course unvext by fear and sin:Go, my beloved son, and earnSuccess, and joy, and safe return.So fast the bonds of duty bind.O Raghu son, thy truthful mind,That naught can turn thee back, or guideThy will so strongly fortified.But O, a little longer stay,Nor turn thy steps this night away,That I one little day---alas!One only---with my son may pass.Me and thy mother do not slight,But stay, my son, with me to-night;With every dainty please thy taste,And seek to-morrow morn the waste.Hard is thy task, O Raghu son,Dire is the toil thou wilt not shun,Far to the lonely wood to flee,And leave thy friends for love of me.I swear it by my truth, believe,For thee, my son, I deeply grieve,Misguided by the traitress dameWith hidden guile like smouldering flame.Now, by her wicked counsel stirred,Thou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.No marvel that my eldest bornWould hold me true when I have sworn.\"Then Ráma having calmly heardHis wretched father speak each word,With Lakshman standing by his sideThus, humbly, to the King replied:\"If dainties now my taste regale,To-morrow must those dainties fail.This day departure I preferTo all that wealth can minister.O\\'er this fair land, no longer mine,Which I, with all her realms, resign,Her multitudes of men, her grain,Her stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.And let the promised boon which thouWast pleased to grant the queen ere now,Be hers in full. Be true, O King,Kind giver of each precious thing.Thy spoken word I still will heed,Obeying all thy lips decreed:And fourteen years in woods will dwellWith those who live in glade and dell.No hopes of power my heart can touch,No selfish joys attract so muchAs son of Raghu, to fulfilWith heart and soul my father will.Dismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,Nor let those drowning torrents flow:The Lord of Rivers in his prideKeeps to the banks that bar his tide.Here in thy presence I declare;By thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;Nor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;Life, heaven, all blessings I despise.I wish to see thee still remainMost true, O King, and free from stain.It must not, Sire, it must not be:I cannot rest one hour with thee.Then bring this sorrow to an end,For naught my settled will can bend.I gave a pledge that binds me too,And to that pledge I still am true.Kaikeyí bade me speed away:She prayed me, and I answered yea.Pine not for me, and weep no more;The wood for us has joy in store,Filled with the wild deer peaceful herdsAnd voices of a thousand birds.A father is the God of each,Yea, e\\'en of Gods, so Scriptures teach:And I will keep my sire decree,For as a God I honour thee.O best of men, the time is nigh,The fourteen years will soon pass byAnd to thine eyes thy son restore:Be comforted, and weep no more.Thou with thy firmness shouldst supportThese weeping crowds who throng the court;Then why, O chief of high renown,So troubled, and thy soul cast down?\"Canto XXXV. Kaikeyí Reproached.Wild with the rage he could not calm,Sumantra, grinding palm on palm,His head in quick impatience shook,And sighed with woe he could not brook.He gnashed his teeth, his eyes were red,From his changed face the colour fled.In rage and grief that knew no law,The temper of the king he saw.With his word-arrows swift and keenHe shook the bosom of the queen.With scorn, as though its lightning strokeWould blast her body, thus he spoke:\"Thou, who, of no dread sin afraid,Hast Dasaratha self betrayed,Lord of the world, whose might sustainsEach thing that moves or fixed remains,What direr crime is left thee now?Death to thy lord and house art thou,Whose cruel deeds the king distress,Mahendra peer in mightiness,Firm as the mountain rooted steep,Enduring as the Ocean deep.Despise not Dasaratha, heIs a kind lord and friend to thee.A loving wife in worth outrunsThe mother of ten million sons.Kings, when their sires have passed away,Succeed by birthright to the sway.Ikshváku son still rules the state,Yet thou this rule wouldst violate.Yea, let thy son, Kaikeyí, reign,Let Bharat rule his sire domain.Thy will, O Queen, shall none oppose:We all will go where Ráma goes.No Bráhman, scorning thee, will restWithin the realm thou governest,But all will fly indignant hence:So great thy trespass and offence.I marvel, when thy crime I see,Earth yawns not quick to swallow thee;And that the Bráhman saints prepareNo burning scourge thy soul to scare,With cries of shame to smite thee, bentUpon our Ráma banishment.The Mango tree with axes fell,And tend instead the Neem tree well,Still watered with all care the treeWill never sweet and pleasant be.Thy mother faults to thee descend,And with thy borrowed nature blend.True is the ancient saw: the NeemCan ne\\'er distil a honeyed stream.Taught by the tale of long agoThy mother hateful sin we know.A bounteous saint, as all have heard,A boon upon thy sire conferred,And all the eloquence revealedThat fills the wood, the flood, the field.No creature walked, or swam, or flew,But he its varied language knew.One morn upon his couch he heardThe chattering of a gorgeous bird.And as he marked its close intentHe laughed aloud in merriment.Thy mother furious with her lord,And fain to perish by the cord,Said to her husband: \"I would know,O Monarch, why thou laughest so.\"The king in answer spake again:\"If I this laughter should explain,This very hour would be my last,For death, be sure would follow fast.\"Again thy mother, flushed with ire,To Kekaya spake, thy royal sire:\"Tell me the cause; then live or die:I will not brook thy laugh, not I.\"Thus by his darling wife addressed,The king whose might all earth confessed,To that kind saint his story toldWho gave the wondrous gift of old.He listened to the king complaint,And thus in answer spoke the saint:\"King, let her quit thy home or die,But never with her prayer comply.\"The saint reply his trouble stilled,And all his heart with pleasure filled.Thy mother from his home he sent,And days like Lord Kuvera spent.So thou wouldst force the king, misledBy thee, in evil paths to tread,And bent on evil wouldst begin,Through folly, this career of sin.Most true, methinks, in thee is shownThe ancient saw so widely known:The sons their fathers\\' worth declareAnd girls their mothers\\' nature share.So be not thou. For pity sakeAccept the word the monarch spake.Thy husband will, O Queen, obey,And be the people hope and stay,O, do not, urged by folly, drawThe king to tread on duty law.The lord who all the world sustains,Bright as the God o\\'er Gods who reigns.Our glorious king, by sin unstained,Will never grant what fraud obtained;No shade of fault in him is seen:Let Ráma be anointed, Queen.Remember, Queen, undying shameWill through the world pursue thy name,If Ráma leave the king his sire,And, banished, to the wood retire.Come, from thy breast this fever fling:Of his own realm be Ráma king.None in this city e\\'er can dwellTo tend and love thee half so well.When Ráma sits in royal place,True to the custom of his raceOur monarch of the mighty bowA hermit to the woods will go.\"(310)Sumantra thus, palm joined to palm,Poured forth his words of bane and balm,With keen reproach, with pleading kind,Striving to move Kaikeyí mind.In vain he prayed, in vain reproved,She heard unsoftened and unmoved.Nor could the eyes that watched her viewOne yielding look, one change of hue.Canto XXXVI. Siddhárth Speech.Ikshváku son with anguish tornFor the great oath his lips had sworn,With tears and sighs of sharpest painThus to Sumantra spake again:\"Prepare thou quick a perfect force,Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,To follow Raghu scion henceEquipped with all magnificence.Let traders with the wealth they sell,And those who charming stories tell,And dancing-women fair of face,The prince ample chariots grace.On all the train who throng his courts,And those who share his manly sports,Great gifts of precious wealth bestow,And bid them with their master go.Let noble arms, and many a wain,And townsmen swell the prince train;And hunters best for woodland skillTheir places in the concourse fill.While elephants and deer he slays,Drinking wood honey as he strays,And looks on streams each fairer yet,His kingdom he may chance forget.Let all my gold and wealth of cornWith Ráma to the wilds be borne;For it will soothe the exile lotTo sacrifice in each pure spot,Deal ample largess forth, and meetEach hermit in his calm retreat.The wealth shall Ráma with him bear,Ayodhyá shall be Bharat share.\"As thus Kakutstha offspring spoke,Fear in Kaikeyí breast awoke.The freshness of her face was dried,Her trembling tongue was terror-tied.Alarmed and sad, with bloodless cheek,She turned to him and scarce could speak:\"Nay, Sire, but Bharat shall not gainAn empty realm where none remain.My Bharat shall not rule a wasteReft of all sweets to charm the taste--The wine-cup dregs, all dull and dead,Whence the light foam and life are fled.\"Thus in her rage the long-eyed dameSpoke her dire speech untouched by shame.Then, answering, Dasaratha spoke:\"Why, having bowed me to the yoke,Dost thou, must cruel, spur and goadMe who am struggling with the load?Why didst thou not oppose at firstThis hope, vile Queen, so fondly nursed?\"Scarce could the monarch angry speechThe ears of the fair lady reach,When thus, with double wrath inflamed,Kaikeyí to the king exclaimed:\"Sagar, from whom thy line is traced,Drove forth his eldest son disgraced,Called Asamanj, whose fate we know:Thus should thy son to exile go.\"\"Fie on thee, dame!\" the monarch said;Each of her people bent his head,And stood in shame and sorrow mute:She marked not, bold and resolute.Then great Siddhárth, inflamed with rage,The good old councillor and sageOn whose wise rede the king relied,To Queen Kaikeyí thus replied:\"But Asamanj the cruel laidHis hands on infants as they played,Cast them to Sarjú flood, and smiledFor pleasure when he drowned a child.\"(311)The people saw, and, furious, spedStraight the the king his sire and said:\"Choose us, O glory of the throne,Choose us, or Asamanj alone.\"\"Whence comes this dread?\" the monarch cried;And all the people thus replied:\"In folly, King, he loves to layFierce hands upon our babes at play,Casts them to Sarjú flood and joysTo murder our bewildered boys.\"With heedful ear the king of menHeard each complaining citizen.To please their troubled minds he strove,And from the state his son he drove.With wife and gear upon a carHe placed him quick, and sent him far.And thus he gave commandment, \"HeShall all his days an exile be.\"With basket and with plough he strayedO\\'er mountain heights, through pathless shade,Roaming all lands a weary time,An outcast wretch defiled with crime.Sagar, the righteous path who held,His wicked offspring thus expelled.But what has Ráma done to blame?Why should his sentence be the same?No sin his stainless name can dim;We see no fault at all in him.Pure as the moon, no darkening blotOn his sweet life has left a spot.If thou canst see one fault, e\\'en one,To dim the fame of Raghu son,That fault this hour, O lady, show,And Ráma to the wood shall go.To drive the guiltless to the wild,Truth constant lover, undefiled,Would, by defiance of the right,The glory e\\'en of Indra blight.Then cease, O lady, and dismissThy hope to ruin Ráma bliss,Or all thy gain, O fair of face,Will be men hatred, and disgrace.\"Canto XXXVII. The Coats Of Bark.Thus spake the virtuous sage: and thenRáma addressed the king of men.In laws of meek behaviour bred,Thus to his sire he meekly said:\"King, I renounce all earthly care,And live in woods on woodland fare.What, dead to joys, have I to doWith lordly train and retinue!Who gives his elephant and yetUpon the girths his heart will set?How can a cord attract his eyesWho gives away the nobler prize?Best of the good, with me be ledNo host, my King with banners spread.All wealth, all lordship I resign:The hermit dress alone be mine.Before I go, have here conveyedA little basket and a spade.With these alone I go, content,For fourteen years of banishment.\"With her own hands Kaikeyí tookThe hermit coats of bark, and, \"Look,\"She cried with bold unblushing browBefore the concourse, \"Dress thee now.\"That lion leader of the braveTook from her hand the dress she gave,Cast his fine raiment on the ground,And round his waist the vesture bound.Then quick the hero Lakshman tooHis garment from his shoulders threw,And, in the presence of his sire,Indued the ascetic rough attire.But Sítá, in her silks arrayed,Threw glances, trembling and afraid,On the bark coat she had to wear,Like a shy doe that eyes the snare.Ashamed and weeping for distressFrom the queen hand she took the dress.The fair one, by her husband sideWho matched heaven minstrel monarch,(312) cried:\"How bind they on their woodland dress,Those hermits of the wilderness?\"There stood the pride of Janak racePerplexed, with sad appealing face.One coat the lady fingers grasped,One round her neck she feebly clasped,But failed again, again, confusedBy the wild garb she ne\\'er had used.Then quickly hastening Ráma, prideOf all who cherish virtue, tiedThe rough bark mantle on her, o\\'erThe silken raiment that she wore.Then the sad women when they sawRáma the choice bark round her draw,Rained water from each tender eye,And cried aloud with bitter cry:\"O, not on her, beloved, notOn Sítá falls thy mournful lot.If, faithful to thy father will,Thou must go forth, leave Sítá still.Let Sítá still remaining hereOur hearts with her loved presence cheer.With Lakshman by thy side to aidSeek thou, dear son, the lonely shade.Unmeet, one good and fair as sheShould dwell in woods a devotee.Let not our prayers be prayed in vain:Let beauteous Sítá yet remain;For by thy love of duty tiedThou wilt not here thyself abide.\"Then the king venerable guideVasishtha, when he saw each coatEnclose the lady waist and throat,Her zeal with gentle words repressed,And Queen Kaikeyí thus addressed:\"O evil-hearted sinner, shameOf royal Kekaya race and name;Who matchless in thy sin couldst cheatThy lord the king with vile deceit;Lost to all sense of duty, knowSítá to exile shall not go.Sítá shall guard, as \\'twere her own,The precious trust of Ráma throne.Those joined by wedlock sweet controlHave but one self and common soul.Thus Sítá shall our empress be,For Ráma self and soul is she.Or if she still to Ráma cleaveAnd for the woods the kingdom leave:If naught her loving heart deter,We and this town will follow her.The warders of the queen shall takeTheir wives and go for Ráma sake,The nation with its stores of grain,The city wealth shall swell his train.Bharat, Satrughna both will wearBark mantles, and his lodging share,Still with their elder brother dwellIn the wild wood, and serve him well.Rest here alone, and rule thy stateUnpeopled, barren, desolate;Be empress of the land and trees,Thou sinner whom our sorrows please.The land which Ráma reigns not o\\'erShall bear the kingdom name no more:The woods which Ráma wanders throughShall be our home and kingdom too.Bharat, be sure, will never deignO\\'er realms his father yields, to reign.Nay, if the king true son he be,He will not, sonlike, dwell with thee.Nay, shouldst thou from the earth arise,And send thy message from the skies,To his forefathers\\' custom trueNo erring course would he pursue.So hast thou, by thy grievous fault,Offended him thou wouldst exalt.In all the world none draws his breathWho loves not Ráma, true to death.This day, O Queen, shalt thou beholdBirds, deer, and beasts from lea and foldTurn to the woods in Ráma train.And naught save longing trees remain.\"Canto XXXVIII. Care For KausalyáThen when the people wroth and sadSaw Sítá in bark vesture clad,Though wedded, like some widowed thing,They cried out, \"Shame upon thee, King!\"Grieved by their cry and angry lookThe lord of earth at once forsookAll hope in life that still remained,In duty, self, and fame unstained.Ikshváku son with burning sighsOn Queen Kaikeyí bent his eyes,And said: \"But Sítá must not fleeIn garments of a devotee.My holy guide has spoken truth:Unfit is she in tender youth,So gently nurtured, soft and fair,The hardships of the wood to share.How has she sinned, devout and true,The noblest monarch child,That she should garb of bark indueAnd journey to the wild?That she should spend her youthful daysAmid a hermit band,Like some poor mendicant who straysSore troubled, through the land?Ah, let the child of Janak throwHer dress of bark aside,And let the royal lady goWith royal wealth supplied.Not such the pledge I gave before,Unfit to linger here:The oath, which I the sinner sworeIs kept, and leaves her clear.Won from her childlike love this tooMy instant death would be,As blossoms on the old bambooDestroy the parent tree.(313)If aught amiss by Ráma doneOffend thee, O thou wicked one,What least transgression canst thou findIn her, thou worst of womankind?What shade of fault in her appears,Whose full soft eye is like the deer?What canst thou blame in Janak child,So gentle, modest, true, and mild?Is not one crime complete, that sentMy Ráma forth to banishment?And wilt thou other sins commit,Thou wicked one, to double it?This is the pledge and oath I swore,What thou besoughtest, and no more,Of Ráma--for I heard thee, dame--When he for consecration came.Now with this limit not content,In hell should be thy punishment,Who fain the Maithil bride wouldst pressTo clothe her limbs with hermit dress.\"Thus spake the father in his woe;And Ráma, still prepared to go,To him who sat with drooping headSpake in return these words and said:\"Just King, here stands my mother dear,Kausalyá, one whom all revere.Submissive, gentle, old is she,And keeps her lips from blame of thee,For her, kind lord, of me bereftA sea of whelming woe is left.O, show her in her new distressStill fonder love and tenderness.Well honoured by thine honoured handHer grief for me let her withstand,Who wrapt in constant thought of meIn me would live a devotee.Peer of Mahendra, O, to her be kind,And treat I pray, my gentle mother so,That, when I dwell afar, her life resigned,She may not pass to Yáma realm for woe.\"Canto XXXIX. Counsel To Sítá.Scarce had the sire, with each dear queen,Heard Ráma pleading voice, and seenHis darling in his hermit dressEre failed his senses for distress.Convulsed with woe, his soul that shook,On Raghu son he could not look;Or if he looked with failing eyeHe could not to the chief reply.By pangs of bitter grief assailed,The long-armed monarch wept and wailed,Half dead a while and sore distraught,While Ráma filled his every thought.\"This hand of mine in days ere nowHas reft her young from many a cow,Or living things has idly slain:Hence comes, I ween, this hour of pain.Not till the hour is come to dieCan from its shell the spirit fly.Death comes not, and Kaikeyí stillTorments the wretch she cannot kill,Who sees his son before him quitThe fine soft robes his rank that fit,And, glorious as the burning fire,In hermit garb his limbs attire.Now all the people grieve and groanThrough Queen Kaikeyí deed alone,Who, having dared this deed of sin,Strives for herself the gain to win.\"He spoke. With tears his eyes grew dim,His senses all deserted him.He cried, O Ráma, once, then weakAnd fainting could no further speak.Unconscious there he lay: at lengthRegathering his sense and strength,While his full eyes their torrents shed,To wise Sumantra thus he said:\"Yoke the light car, and hither leadFleet coursers of the noblest breed,And drive this heir of lofty fateBeyond the limit of the state.This seems the fruit that virtues bear,The meed of worth which texts declare--The sending of the brave and goodBy sire and mother to the wood.\\'\"He heard the monarch, and obeyed,With ready feet that ne\\'er delayed,And brought before the palace gateThe horses and the car of state.Then to the monarch son he sped,And raising hands of reverence saidThat the light car which gold made fair,With best of steeds, was standing there.King Dasaratha called in hasteThe lord o\\'er all his treasures placed.And spoke, well skilled in place and time,His will to him devoid of crime:\"Count all the years she has to liveAfar in forest wilds, and giveTo Sítá robes and gems of priceAs for the time may well suffice.\"Quick to the treasure-room he went,Charged by that king most excellent,Brought the rich stores, and gave them allTo Sítá in the monarch hall.The Maithil dame of high descentReceived each robe and ornament,And tricked those limbs, whose lines foretoldHigh destiny, with gems and gold.So well adorned, so fair to view,A glory through the hall she threw:So, when the Lord of Light upsprings,His radiance o\\'er the sky he flings.Then Queen Kausalyá spake at last,With loving arms about her cast,Pressed lingering kisses on her head,And to the high-souled lady said:\"Ah, in this faithless world belowWhen dark misfortune comes and woe,Wives, loved and cherished every day,Neglect their lords and disobey.Yes, woman nature still is this:--After long days of calm and blissWhen some light grief her spirit tries,She changes all her love, or flies.Young wives are thankless, false in soul,With roving hearts that spurn control.Brooding on sin and quickly changed,In one short hour their love estranged.Not glorious deed or lineage fair,Not knowledge, gift, or tender careIn chains of lasting love can bindA woman light inconstant mind.But those good dames who still maintainWhat right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain--No holy thing in their pure eyesWith one beloved husband vies.Nor let thy lord my son, condemnedTo exile, be by thee contemned,For be he poor or wealthy, heIs as a God, dear child, to thee.\"When Sítá heard Kausalyá speechHer duty and her gain to teach,She joined her palms with reverent graceAnd gave her answer face to face:\"All will I do, forgetting naught,Which thou, O honoured Queen, hast taught.I know, have heard, and deep have storedThe rules of duty to my lord.Not me, good Queen, shouldst thou includeAmong the faithless multitude.Its own sweet light the moon shall leaveEre I to duty cease to cleave.The stringless lute gives forth no strain,The wheelless car is urged in vain;No joy a lordless dame, althoughBlest with a hundred sons, can know.From father, brother, and from sonA measured share of joy is won:Who would not honour, love, and blessHer lord, whose gifts are measureless?Thus trained to think, I hold in aweScripture command and duty law.Him can I hold in slight esteem?Her lord is woman God, I deem.\"Kausalyá heard the lady speech,Nor failed those words her heart to reach.Then, pure in mind, she gave to flowThe tear that sprang of joy and woe.Then duteous Ráma forward cameAnd stood before the honoured dame,And joining reverent hands addressedThe queen in rank above the rest:\"O mother, from these tears refrain;Look on my sire and still thy pain.To thee my days afar shall flyAs if sweet slumber closed thine eye,And fourteen years of exile seemTo thee, dear mother, like a dream.On me returning safe and well,Girt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.\"Thus for their deep affection sakeThe hero to his mother spake,Then to the half seven hundred too,Wives of his sire, paid reverence due.Thus Dasaratha son addressedThat crowd of matrons sore distressed:\"If from these lips, while here I dwelt,One heedless taunt you e\\'er have felt,Forgive me, pray. And now adieu,I bid good-bye to all of you.\"Then straight, like curlews\\' cries, upwentThe voices of their wild lament,While, as he bade farewell, the crowdOf royal women wept aloud,And through the ample hall extent.Where erst the sound of tabour, blentWith drum and shrill-toned instrument,In joyous concert rose,Now rang the sound of wailing high,The lamentation and the cry,The shriek, the choking sob, the sighThat told the ladies\\' woes.Canto XL. Ráma Departure.Then Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman bentAt the king feet, and sadly wentRound him with slow steps reverent.When Ráma of the duteous heartHad gained his sire consent to part,With Sítá by his side he paidDue reverence to the queen dismayed.And Lakshman, with affection meet,Bowed down and clasped his mother feet.Sumitrá viewed him as he pressedHer feet, and thus her son addressed:\"Neglect not Ráma wandering there,But tend him with thy faithful care.In hours of wealth, in time of woe,Him, sinless son, thy refuge know.From this good law the just ne\\'er swerve,That younger sons the eldest serve,And to this righteous rule inclineAll children of thine ancient line--Freely to give, reward each rite,Nor spare their bodies in the fight.Let Ráma Dasaratha be,Look upon Sítá as on me,And let the cot wherein you dwellBe thine Ayodhyá. Fare thee well.\"Her blessing thus Sumitrá gaveTo him whose soul to Ráma clave,Exclaiming, when her speech was done,\"Go forth, O Lakshman, go, my son.Go forth, my son to win success,High victory and happiness.Go forth thy foemen to destroy,And turn again at last with joy.\"As Mátali his charioteerSpeaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,Sumantra, palm to palm applied,In reverence trained, to Ráma cried:\"O famous Prince, my car ascend,--May blessings on thy course attend,--And swiftly shall my horses fleeAnd place thee where thou biddest me.The fourteen years thou hast to stayFar in the wilds, begin to-day;For Oueen Kaikeyí cries, Away.\"Then Sítá, best of womankind,Ascended, with a tranquil mind,Soon as her toilet task was done,That chariot brilliant as the sun.Ráma and Lakshman true and boldSprang on the car adorned with gold.The king those years had counted o\\'er,And given Sítá robes and storeOf precious ornaments to wearWhen following her husband there.The brothers in the car found placeFor nets and weapons of the chase,There warlike arms and mail they laid,A leathern basket and a spade.Soon as Sumantra saw the threeWere seated in the chariot, heUrged on each horse of noble breed,Who matched the rushing wind in speed.As thus the son of Raghu wentForth for his dreary banishment,Chill numbing grief the town assailed,All strength grew weak, all spirit failed,Ayodhyá through her wide extentWas filled with tumult and lament:Steeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,Each elephant returned a roar.Then all the city, young and old,Wild with their sorrow uncontrolled,Rushed to the car, as, from the sunThe panting herds to water run.Before the car, behind, they clung,And there as eagerly they hung,With torrents streaming from their eyes,Called loudly with repeated cries:\"Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;Drive gently, and thy steeds restrain.Once more on Ráma will we gaze,Now to be lost for many days.The queen his mother has, be sure,A heart of iron, to endureTo see her godlike Ráma go,Nor feel it shattered by the blow.Sítá, well done! Videha pride,Still like his shadow by his side;Rejoicing in thy duty stillAs sunlight cleaves to Meru hill.Thou, Lakshman, too, hast well deserved,Who from thy duty hast not swerved,Tending the peer of Gods above,Whose lips speak naught but words of love.Thy firm resolve is nobly great,And high success on thee shall wait.Yea, thou shalt win a priceless meed--Thy path with him to heaven shall lead.\"As thus they spake, they could not holdThe tears that down their faces rolled,While still they followed for a spaceTheir darling of Ikshváku race.There stood surrounded by a ringOf mournful wives the mournful king;For, \"I will see once more,\" he cried,\"Mine own dear son,\" and forth he hied.As he came near, there rose the soundOf weeping, as the dames stood round.So the she-elephants complainWhen their great lord and guide is slain.Kakutstha son, the king of men,The glorious sire, looked troubled then,As the full moon is when dismayedBy dark eclipse threatening shade.Then Dasaratha son, designedFor highest fate of lofty mind,Urged to more speed the charioteer,\"Away, away! why linger here?Urge on thy horses,\" Rama cried,And \"Stay, O stay,\" the people sighed.Sumantra, urged to speed away,The townsmen call must disobey,Forth as the long-armed hero went,The dust his chariot wheels up sentWas laid by streams that ever flowedFrom their sad eyes who filled the road.Then, sprung of woe, from eyes of allThe women drops began to fall,As from each lotus on the lakeThe darting fish the water shake.When he, the king of high renown,Saw that one thought held all the town,Like some tall tree he fell and lay,Whose root the axe has hewn away.Then straight a mighty cry from thoseWho followed Ráma car arose,Who saw their monarch fainting thereBeneath that grief too great to bear.Then \"Ráma, Ráma!\" with the cryOf \"Ah, his mother!\" sounded high,As all the people wept aloudAround the ladies\\' sorrowing crowd.When Ráma backward turned his eye,And saw the king his father lieWith troubled sense and failing limb,And the sad queen, who followed him,Like some young creature in the net,That will not, in its misery, letIts wild eyes on its mother rest,So, by the bonds of duty pressed,His mother look he could not meet.He saw them with their weary feet,Who, used to bliss, in cars should ride,Who ne\\'er by sorrow should be tried,And, as one mournful look he cast,\"Drive on,\" he cried, \"Sumantra, fast.\"As when the driver torturing hookGoads on an elephant, the lookOf sire and mother in despairWas more than Ráma heart could bear.As mother kine to stalls returnWhich hold the calves for whom they yearn,So to the car she tried to runAs a cow seeks her little one.Once and again the hero eyesLooked on his mother, as with criesOf woe she called and gestures wild,\"O Sítá, Lakshman, O my child!\"\"Stay,\" cried the king, \"thy chariot stay:\"\"On, on,\" cried Ráma, \"speed away.\"As one between two hosts, inclinedTo neither was Sumantra mind.But Ráma spake these words again:\"A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.On, on; and if his wrath grow hot,Thine answer be, \\'I heard thee not.\\' \"Sumantra, at the chief behest,Dismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,And, as he bade, to swiftest speedUrged on his way each willing steed.The king attendants parted thence,And paid him heart-felt reverence:In mind, and with the tears he wept,Each still his place near Ráma kept.As swift away the horses sped,His lords to Dasaratha said:\"To follow him whom thou againWouldst see returning home is vain.\"With failing limb and drooping mienHe heard their counsel wise:Still on their son the king and queenKept fast their lingering eyes.(314)Canto XLI. The Citizens\\' Lament.The lion chief with hands upraisedWas born from eyes that fondly gazed.But then the ladies\\' bower was rentWith cries of weeping and lament:\"Where goes he now, our lord, the sureProtector of the friendless poor,In whom the wretched and the weakDefence and aid were wont to seek?All words of wrath he turned aside,And ne\\'er, when cursed, in ire replied.He shared his people woe, and stilledThe troubled breast which rage had filled.Our chief, on lofty thoughts intent,In glorious fame preëminent:As on his own dear mother, thusHe ever looked on each of us.Where goes he now? His sire behest,By Queen Kaikeyí guile distressed,Has banished to the forest henceHim who was all the world defence.Ah, senseless King, to drive awayThe hope of men, their guard and stay,To banish to the distant woodRáma the duteous, true, and good!\"The royal dames, like cows bereavedOf their young calves, thus sadly grieved.The monarch heard them as they wailed,And by the fire of grief assailedFor his dear son, he bowed his head,And all his sense and memory fled.Then were no fires of worship fed,Thick darkness o\\'er the sun was spread.The cows their thirsty calves denied,And elephants flung their food aside.Trisanku,(315) Jupiter looked dread,And Mercury and Mars the red,In direful opposition met,The glory of the moon beset.The lunar stars withheld their light,The planets were no longer bright,But meteors with their horrid glare,And dire Visákhás(316) lit the air.As troubled Ocean heaves and ravesWhen Doom wild tempest sweeps the waves,Thus all Ayodhyá reeled and bentWhen Ráma to the forest went.And chilling grief and dark despairFell suddenly on all men there.Their wonted pastime all forgot,Nor thought of food, or touched it not.Crowds in the royal street were seenWith weeping eye and troubled mien:No more a people gay and glad,Each head and heart was sick and sad.No more the cool wind softly blew,The moon no more was fair to view,No more the sun with genial glowCherished the world now plunged in woe.Sons, brothers, husbands, wedded wivesForgot the ties that joined their lives;No thought for kith and kin was spared,But all for only Ráma cared.And Ráma friends who loved him best,Their minds disordered and distressed.By the great burthen of their woesTurned not to slumber or repose.Like Earth with all her hills bereftOf Indra guiding care.Ayodhyá in her sorrow leftBy him, the high souled heir,Was bowed by fear and sorrow force,And shook with many a throe,While warrior, elephant, and horseSent up the cry of woe.Canto XLII. Dasaratha Lament.While yet the dust was seen afarThat marked the course of Ráma car,The glory of Ikshváku raceTurned not away his eager face.While yet his duteous son he sawHe could not once his gaze withdraw,But rooted to the spot remainedWith eyes that after Ráma strained.But when that dust no more he viewed,Fainting he fell by grief subdued.To his right hand Kausalyá went,And ready aid the lady lent,While Bharat loving mother triedTo raise him on the other side.The king, within whose ordered soulJustice and virtue held control,To Queen Kaikeyí turned and said,With every sense disquieted:\"Touch me not, thou whose soul can plotAll sin. Kaikeyí, touch me not.No loving wife, no friend to me,I ne\\'er again would look on thee;Ne\\'er from this day have aught to doWith thee and all thy retinue;Thee whom no virtuous thoughts restrain,Whose selfish heart seeks only gain.The hand I laid in mine, O dame,The steps we took around the flame,(317)And all that links thy life to mineHere and hereafter I resign.If Bharat too, thy darling son,Joy in the rule thy art has won,Ne\\'er may the funeral offerings paidBy his false hand approach my shade.\"Then while the dust upon him hung,The monarch to Kausalyá clung,And she with mournful steps and slowTurned to the palace, worn with woe.As one whose hand has touched the fire,Or slain a Bráhman in his ire,He felt his heart with sorrow tornStill thinking of his son forlorn.Each step was torture, as the roadThe traces of the chariot showed,And as the shadowed sun grows dimSo care and anguish darkened him.He raised a cry, by woe distraught,As of his son again he thought.And judging that the car had spedBeyond the city, thus he said:\"I still behold the foot-prints madeBy the good horses that conveyedMy son afar: these marks I see,But high-souled Ráma, where is he?Ah me, my son! my first and best,On pleasant couches wont to rest,With limbs perfumed with sandal, fannedBy many a beauty tender hand:Where will he lie with log or stoneBeneath him for a pillow thrown,To leave at morn his earthy bed,Neglected, and with dust o\\'erspread,As from the flood with sigh and pantComes forth the husband elephant?The men who make the woods their homeShall see the long-armed hero roamRoused from his bed, though lord of all,In semblance of a friendless thrall.Janak dear child who ne\\'er has metWith aught save joy and comfort yet,Will reach to-day the forest, wornAnd wearied with the brakes of thorn.Ah, gentle girl, of woods unskilled,How will her heart with dread be filledAt the wild beasts\\' deep roaring there,Whose voices lift the shuddering hair!Kaikeyí, glory in thy gain,And, widow queen, begin to reign:No will, no power to live have IWhen my brave son no more is nigh.\"Thus pouring forth laments, the kingGirt by the people crowded ring,Entered the noble bower like oneNew-bathed when funeral rites are done.Where\\'er he looked naught met his gazeBut empty houses, courts, and ways.Closed were the temples: countless feetNo longer trod the royal street,And thinking of his son he viewedMen weak and worn and woe-subdued.As sinks the sun into a cloud,So passed he on, and wept aloud,Within that house no more to beThe dwelling of the banished three,Brave Ráma, his Vedehan bride,And Lakshman by his brother side:Like broad still waters, when the kingOf all the birds that ply the wingHas swooped from heaven and borne awayThe glittering snakes that made them gay.With choking sobs and voice half spentThe king renewed his sad lament:With broken utterance faint and lowScarce could he speak these words of woe:\"My steps to Ráma mother guide,And place me by Kausalyá side:There, only there my heart may knowSome little respite from my woe.\"The warders of the palace ledThe monarch, when his words were said,To Queen Kausalyá bower, and thereLaid him with reverential care.But while he rested on the bedStill was his soul disquieted.In grief he tossed his arms on highLamenting with a piteous cry:\"O Ráma, Ráma,\" thus said he,\"My son, thou hast forsaken me.High bliss awaits those favoured menLeft living in Ayodhyá then,Whose eyes shall see my son once moreReturning when the time is o\\'er.\"Then came the night, whose hated gloomFell on him like the night of doom.At midnight Dasaratha criedTo Queen Kausalyá by his side:\"I see thee not, Kausalyá; layThy gentle hand in mine, I pray.When Ráma left his home my sightWent with him, nor returns to-night.\"Canto XLIII. Kausalyá Lament.Kausalyá saw the monarch lieWith drooping frame and failing eye,And for her banished son distressedWith these sad words her lord addressed:\"Kaikeyí, cruel, false, and vileHas cast the venom of her guileOn Ráma lord of men, and sheWill ravage like a snake set free;And more and more my soul alarm,Like a dire serpent bent on harm,For triumph crowns each dark intent,And Ráma to the wild is sent.Ah, were he doomed but here to strayBegging his food from day to day,Or do, enslaved, Kaikeyí will,This were a boon, a comfort still.But she, as chose her cruel hate,Has hurled him from his high estate,As Bráhmans when the moon is newCast to the ground the demons\\' due.(318)The long-armed hero, like the lordOf Nágas, with his bow and swordBegins, I ween, his forest lifeWith Lakshman and his faithful wife.Ah, how will fare the exiles now,Whom, moved by Queen Kaikeyí, thouHast sent in forests to abide,Bred in delights, by woe untried?Far banished when their lives are young,With the fair fruit before them hung,Deprived of all their rank that suits,How will they live on grain and roots?O, that my years of woe were passed,And the glad hour were come at lastWhen I shall see my children dear,Ráma, his wife, and Lakshman here!When shall Ayodhyá, wild with glee,Again those mighty heroes see,And decked with wreaths her banners waveTo welcome home the true and brave?When will the beautiful city viewWith happy eyes the lordly twoReturning, joyful as the mainWhen the dear moon is full again?When, like some mighty bull who leadsThe cow exulting through the meads,Will Ráma through the city ride,Strong-armed, with Sítá at his side?When will ten thousand thousand meetAnd crowd Ayodhyá royal street,And grain in joyous welcome throwUpon my sons who tame the foe?When with delight shall youthful bandsOf Bráhman maidens in their handsBear fruit and flowers in goodly show,And circling round Ayodhyá go?With ripened judgment of a sage,And godlike in his blooming age,When shall my virtuous son appear,Like kindly rain, our hearts to cheer?Ah, in a former life, I ween,This hand of mine, most base and mean,Has dried the udders of the kineAnd left the thirsty calves to pine.Hence, as the lion robs the cow,Kaikeyí makes me childless now,Exulting from her feebler foeTo rend the son she cherished so.I had but him, in Scripture skilled,With every grace his soul was filled.Now not a joy has life to give,And robbed of him I would not live:Yea, all my days are dark and drearIf he, my darling, be not near,And Lakshman brave, my heart to cheer.As for my son I mourn and yearn,The quenchless flames of anguish burnAnd kill me with the pain,As in the summer noontide blazeThe glorious Day-God with his raysConsumes the parching plain.\"Canto XLIV. Sumitrá Speech.Kausalyá ceased her sad lament,Of beauteous dames most excellent.Sumitrá who to duty clave,In righteous words this answer gave:\"Dear Queen, all noble virtues graceThy son, of men the first in place.Why dost thou shed these tears of woeWith bitter grief lamenting so?If Ráma, leaving royal swayHas hastened to the woods away,\\'Tis for his high-souled father sakeThat he his premise may not break.He to the path of duty clingsWhich lordly fruit hereafter brings--The path to which the righteous cleave--For him, dear Queen, thou shouldst not grieve.And Lakshman too, the blameless-souled,The same high course with him will hold,And mighty bliss on him shall wait,So tenderly compassionate.And Sítá, bred with tender care,Well knows what toils await her there,But in her love she will not partFrom Ráma of the virtuous heart.Now has thy son through all the worldThe banner of his fame unfurled;True, modest, careful of his vow,What has he left to aim at now?The sun will mark his mighty soul,His wisdom, sweetness, self-control,Will spare from pain his face and limb,And with soft radiance shine for him.For him through forest glades shall springA soft auspicious breeze, and bringIts tempered heat and cold to playAround him ever night and day.The pure cold moonbeams shall delightThe hero as he sleeps at night,And soothe him with the soft caressOf a fond parent tenderness.To him, the bravest of the brave,His heavenly arms the Bráhman gave,When fierce Suváhu dyed the plainWith his life-blood by Ráma slain.Still trusting to his own right armThy hero son will fear no harm:As in his father palace, heIn the wild woods will dauntless be.Whene\\'er he lets his arrows flyHis stricken foemen fall and die:And is that prince of peerless worthToo weak to keep and sway the earth?His sweet pure soul, his beauty charm,His hero heart, his warlike arm,Will soon redeem his rightful reignWhen from the woods he comes again.The Bráhmans on the prince headKing-making drops shall quickly shed,And Sítá, Earth, and Fortune shareThe glories which await the heir.For him, when forth his chariot swept,The crowd that thronged Ayodhyá wept,With agonizing woe distressed.With him in hermít mantle dressedIn guise of Sítá Lakshmí went,And none his glory may prevent.Yea, naught to him is high or hard,Before whose steps, to be his guard,Lakshman, the best who draws the bow,With spear, shaft, sword rejoiced to go.His wanderings in the forest o\\'er,Thine eyes shall see thy son once more,Quit thy faint heart, thy grief dispel,For this, O Queen, is truth I tell.Thy son returning, moonlike, thence,Shall at thy feet do reverence,And, blest and blameless lady, thouShalt see his head to touch them bow,Yea, thou shalt see thy son made kingWhen he returns with triumphing,And how thy happy eyes will brimWith tears of joy to look on him!Thou, blameless lady, shouldst the wholeOf the sad people here console:Why in thy tender heart allowThis bitter grief to harbour now?As the long banks of cloud distilTheir water when they see the hill,So shall the drops of rapture runFrom thy glad eyes to see thy sonReturning, as he lowly bendsTo greet thee, girt by all his friends.\"Thus soothing, kindly eloquent,With every hopeful argumentKausalyá heart by sorrow rent,Fair Queen Sumitrá ceased.Kausalyá heard each pleasant plea,And grief began to leave her free,As the light clouds of autumn flee,Their watery stores decreased.Canto XLV. The Tamasá.Their tender love the people drewTo follow Ráma brave and true,The high-souled hero, as he wentForth from his home to banishment.The king himself his friends obeyed,And turned him homeward as they prayed.But yet the people turned not back,Still close on Ráma chariot track.For they who in Ayodhyá dweltFor him such fond affection felt,Decked with all grace and glories high,The dear full moon of every eye.Though much his people prayed and wept,Kakutstha son his purpose kept,And still his journey would pursueTo keep the king his father true.Deep in the hero bosom sankTheir love, whose signs his glad eye drank.He spoke to cheer them, as his ownDear children, in a loving tone:\"If ye would grant my fond desire,Give Bharat now that love entireAnd reverence shown to me by allWho dwell within Ayodhyá wall.For he, Kaikeyí darling son,His virtuous career will run,And ever bound by duty chainConsult your weal and bliss and gain.In judgment old, in years a child,With hero virtues meek and mild,A fitting lord is he to cheerHis people and remove their fear.In him all kingly gifts abound,More noble than in me are found:Imperial prince, well proved and tried--Obey him as your lord and guide.And grant, I pray, the boon I ask:To please the king be still your task,That his fond heart, while I remainFar in the wood, may feel no pain.\"The more he showed his will to treadThe path where filial duty led,The more the people, round him thronged,For their dear Ráma empire longed.Still more attached his followers grew,As Ráma, with his brother, drewThe people with his virtues\\' ties,Lamenting all with tear-dimmed eyes.The saintly twice-born, triply oldIn glory, knowledge, seasons told,With hoary heads that shook and bowed,Their voices raised and spake aloud:\"O steeds, who best and noblest are,Who whirl so swiftly Ráma car,Go not, return: we call on you:Be to your master kind and true.For speechless things are swift to hear,And naught can match a horse ear,O generous steeds, return, when thusYou hear the cry of all of us.Each vow he keeps most firm and sure,And duty makes his spirit pure.Back with our chief! not wood-ward hence;Back to his royal residence!\"Soon as he saw the aged band.Exclaiming in their misery, stand,And their sad cries around him rang,Swift from his chariot Ráma sprang.Then, still upon his journey bent,With Sítá and with Lakshman wentThe hero by the old men sideSuiting to theirs his shortened stride.He could not pass the twice-born throngAs weariedly they walked along:With pitying heart, with tender eye,He could not in his chariot fly.When the steps of Ráma viewedThat still his onward course pursued,Woe shook the troubled heart of each,And burnt with grief they spoke this speech--\"With thee, O Ráma, to the woodAll Bráhmans go and Bráhmanhood:Borne on our aged shoulders, see,Our fires of worship go with thee.Bright canopies that lend their shadeIn Vájapeya(319) rites displayed,In plenteous store are borne behindLike cloudlets in the autumn wind.No shelter from the sun hast thou,And, lest his fury burn thy brow,These sacrificial shades we bearShall aid thee in the noontide glare.Our hearts, who ever loved to poreOn sacred text and Vedic lore,Now all to thee, beloved, turn,And for a life in forests yearn.Deep in our aged bosoms liesThe Vedas\\' lore, the wealth we prize,There still, like wives at home, shall dwell,Whose love and truth protect them well.To follow thee our hearts are bent;We need not plan or argument.All else in duty law we slight,For following thee is following right.O noble Prince, retrace thy way:O, hear us, Ráma, as we lay,With many tears and many prayers,Our aged heads and swan-white hairsLow in the dust before thy feet;O, hear us, Ráma, we entreat.Full many of these who with thee run,Their sacred rites had just begun.Unfinished yet those rites remain;But finished if thou turn again.All rooted life and things that moveTo thee their deep affection prove.To them, when warmed by love, they glowAnd sue to thee, some favour show,Each lowly bush, each towering treeWould follow too for love of thee.Bound by its root it must remain;But--all it can--its boughs complain,As when the wild wind rushes byIt tells its woe in groan and sigh.No more through air the gay birds flit,But, foodless, melancholy sitTogether on the branch and callTo thee whose kind heart feels for all.\"As wailed the aged Bráhmans, bentTo turn him back, with wild lament,Seemed Tamasá herself to aid,Checking his progress, as they prayed.Sumantra from the chariot freedWith ready hand each weary steed;He groomed them with the utmost heed,Their limbs he bathed and dried,Then led them forth to drink and feedAt pleasure in the grassy meadThat fringed the river side.Canto XLVI. The Halt.When Ráma, chief of Raghu race,Arrived at that delightful place,He looked on Sítá first, and thenTo Lakshman spake the lord of men:\"Now first the shades of night descendSince to the wilds our steps we bend.Joy to thee, brother! do not grieveFor our dear home and all we leave.The woods unpeopled seem to weepAround us, as their tenants creepOr fly to lair and den and nest,Both bird and beast, to seek their rest.Methinks Ayodhyá royal townWhere dwells my sire of high renown,With all her men and dames to-nightWill mourn us vanished from their sight.For, by his virtues won, they clingIn fond affection to their king,And thee and me, O brave and true,And Bharat and Satrughna too.I for my sire and mother feelDeep sorrow o\\'er my bosom steal,Lest mourning us, oppressed with fears,They blind their eyes with endless tears.Yet Bharat duteous love will showSweet comfort in their hours of woe,And with kind words their hearts sustain,Suggesting duty, bliss, and gain.I mourn my parents now no more:I count dear Bharat virtues o\\'er,And his kind love and care dispelThe doubts I had, and all is well.And thou thy duty wouldst not shun,And, following me, hast nobly done;Else, bravest, I should need a bandAround my wife as guard to stand.On this first night, my thirst to slake,Some water only will I take:Thus, brother, thus my will decides,Though varied store the wood provides.\"Thus having said to Lakshman, heAddressed in turn Sumantra: \"BeMost diligent to-night, my friend,And with due care thy horses tend.\"The sun had set: Sumantra tiedHis noble horses side by side,Gave store of grass with liberal hand,And rested near them on the strand.Each paid the holy evening rite,And when around them fell the night,The charioteer, with Lakshman aid,A lowly bed for Ráma laid.To Lakshman Ráma bade adieu,And then by Sítá side he threwHis limbs upon the leafy bedTheir care upon the bank had spread.When Lakshman saw the couple slept,Still on the strand his watch he kept,Still with Sumantra there conversed,And Ráma varied gifts rehearsed.All night he watched, nor sought repose,Till on the earth the sun arose:With him Sumantra stayed awake,And still of Ráma virtues spake.Thus, near the river grassy shoreWhich herds unnumbered wandered o\\'er,Repose, untroubled, Ráma found,And all the people lay around.The glorious hero left his bed,Looked on the sleeping crowd, and saidTo Lakshman, whom each lucky lineMarked out for bliss with surest sign:\"O brother Lakshman, look on theseReclining at the roots of trees;All care of house and home resigned,Caring for us with heart and mind,These people of the city yearnTo see us to our home return:To quit their lives will they consent,But never leave their firm intent.Come, while they all unconscious sleep,Let us upon the chariot leap,And swiftly on our journey speedWhere naught our progress may impede,That these fond citizens who roamFar from Ikshváku ancient home,No more may sleep \\'neath bush and tree,Following still for love of me.A prince with tender care should healThe self-brought woes his people feel,And never let his subjects shareThe burthen he is forced to bear.\"Then Lakshman to the chief replied,Who stood like Justice by his side:\"Thy rede, O sage, I well commend:Without delay the car ascend.\"Then Ráma to Sumantra spoke:\"Thy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke.Hence to the forest will I go:Away, my lord, and be not slow.\"Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,Yoked to the car each generous steed,And then, with hand to hand applied,He came before the chief and cried:\"Hail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,Hail, bravest of the chariot-borne!With Sítá and thy brother thouMayst mount: the car is ready now.\"The hero clomb the car with haste:His bow and gear within were placed,And quick the eddying flood he passedOf Tamasá whose waves run fast.Soon as he touched the farther side,That strong-armed hero, glorified,He found a road both wide and clear,Where e\\'en the timid naught could fear.Then, that the crowd might be misled,Thus Ráma to Sumantra said:\"Speed north a while, then hasten back,Returning in thy former track,That so the people may not learnThe course I follow: drive and turn.\"Sumantra, at the chief behest,Quick to the task himself addressed;Then near to Ráma came, and showedThe chariot ready for the road.With Sítá, then, the princely two,Who o\\'er the line of Raghu threwA glory ever bright and new,Upon the chariot stood.Sumantra fast and faster droveHis horses, who in fleetness stroveStill onward to the distant grove,The hermit-haunted wood.Canto XLVII. The Citizens\\' Return.The people, when the morn shone fair,Arose to find no Ráma there.Then fear and numbing grief subduedThe senses of the multitude.The woe-born tears were running fastAs all around their eyes they cast,And sadly looked, but found no traceOf Ráma, searching every place.Bereft of Ráma good and wise,With drooping cheer and weeping eyes,Each woe-distracted sage gave ventTo sorrow in his wild lament:\"Woe worth the sleep that stole our senseWith its beguiling influence,That now we look in vain for himOf the broad chest and stalwart limb!How could the strong-armed hero, thusDeceiving all, abandon us?His people so devoted see,Yet to the woods, a hermit, flee?How can he, wont our hearts to cheer,As a fond sire his children dear,--How can the pride of Raghu raceFly from us to some desert place!Here let us all for death prepare,Or on the last great journey fare;(320)Of Ráma our dear lord bereft,What profit in our lives is left?Huge trunks of trees around us lie,With roots and branches sere and dry,Come let us set these logs on fireAnd throw our bodies on the pyre.What shall we speak? How can we sayWe followed Ráma on his way,The mighty chief whose arm is strong,Who sweetly speaks, who thinks no wrong?Ayodhyá town with sorrow dumb,Without our lord will see us come,And hopeless misery will strikeElder, and child, and dame alike.Forth with that peerless chief we came,Whose mighty heart is aye the same:How, reft of him we love, shall weReturning dare that town to see?\"Complaining thus with varied cryThey tossed their aged arms on high,And their sad hearts with grief were wrung,Like cows who sorrow for their young.A while they followed on the roadWhich traces of his chariot showed,But when at length those traces failed,A deep despair their hearts assailed.The chariot marks no more discerned,The hopeless sages backward turned:\"Ah, what is this? What can we more?Fate stops the way, and all is o\\'er.\"With wearied hearts, in grief and shameThey took the road by which they came,And reached Ayodhyá city, whereFrom side to side was naught but care.With troubled spirits quite cast downThey looked upon the royal town,And from their eyes, oppressed with woe,Their tears again began to flow.Of Ráma reft, the city woreNo look of beauty as before,Like a dull river or a lakeBy Garud robbed of every snake.Dark, dismal as the moonless sky,Or as a sea whose bed is dry,So sad, to every pleasure dead,They saw the town, disquieted.On to their houses, high and vast,Where stores of precious wealth were massed,The melancholy Bráhmans passed,Their hearts with anguish cleft:Aloof from all, they came not nearTo stranger or to kinsman dear,Showing in faces blank and drearThat not one joy was left.Canto XLVIII. The Women Lament.When those who forth with Ráma wentBack to the town their steps had bent,It seemed that death had touched and chilledThose hearts which piercing sorrow filled.Each to his several mansion came,And girt by children and his dame,From his sad eyes the water shedThat o\\'er his cheek in torrents spread.All joy was fled: oppressed with caresNo bustling trader showed his wares.Each shop had lost its brilliant look,Each householder forbore to cook.No hand with joy its earnings told,None cared to win a wealth of gold,And scarce the youthful mother smiledTo see her first, her new-born child.In every house a woman wailed,And her returning lord assailedWith keen taunt piercing like the steelThat bids the tusked monster kneel:\"What now to them is wedded dame,What house and home and dearest aim,Or son, or bliss, or gathered store,Whose eyes on Ráma look no more!There is but one in all the earth,One man alone of real worth,Lakshman, who follows, true and good,Ráma, with Sítá, through the wood.Made holy for all time we deemEach pool and fountain, lake and stream,If great Kakutstha son shall chooseTheir water for his bath to use.Each forest, dark with lovely trees,Shall yearn Kakutstha son to please;Each mountain peak and woody hill,Each mighty flood and mazy rill,Each rocky height, each shady groveWhere the blest feet of Ráma rove,Shall gladly welcome with the bestOf all they have their honoured guest.The trees that clustering blossoms bear,And bright-hued buds to gem their hair,The heart of Ráma shall delight,And cheer him on the breezy height.For him the upland slopes will showThe fairest roots and fruit that grow,And all their wealth before him flingEre the due hour of ripening.For him each earth-upholding hillIts crystal water shall distil,And all its floods shall be displayedIn many a thousand-hued cascade.Where Ráma stands is naught to fear,No danger comes if he be near;For all who live on him depend,The world support, and lord, and friend.Ere in too distant wilds he stray,Let us to Ráma speed away,For rich reward on those will waitWho serve a prince of soul so great.We will attend on Sítá there;Be Raghu son your special care.\"The city dames, with grief distressed,Thus once again their lords addressed:\"Ráma shall be your guard and guide,And Sítá will for us provide.For who would care to linger here,Where all is sad and dark and drear?Who, mid the mourners, hope for blissIn a poor soulless town like this?If Queen Kaikeyí treacherous sin,Our lord expelled, the kingdom win,We heed not sons or golden store,Our life itself we prize no more.If she, seduced by lust of sway,Her lord and son could cast away,Whom would she leave unharmed, the baseDefiler of her royal race?We swear it by our children dear,We will not dwell as servants here;If Queen Kaikeyí live to reign,We will not in her realm remain.Bowed down by her oppressive hand,The helpless, lordless, godless land,Cursed for Kaikeyí guilt will fall,And swift destruction seize it all.For, Ráma forced from home to fly,The king his sire will surely die,And when the king has breathed his lastRuin will doubtless follow fast.Sad, robbed of merits, drug the cupAnd drink the poisoned mixture up,Or share the exiled Ráma lot,Or seek some land that knows her not.No reason, but a false pretenceDrove Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman hence,And we to Bharat have been givenLike cattle to the shambles driven.\"While in each house the women, painedAt loss of Ráma, still complained,Sank to his rest the Lord of Day,And night through all the sky held sway.The fires of worship all were cold,No text was hummed, no tale was told,And shades of midnight gloom came downEnveloping the mournful town.Still, sick at heart, the women shed,As for a son or husband fled,For Ráma tears, disquieted:No child was loved as he.And all Ayodhyá, where the feast,Music, and song, and dance had ceased,And merriment and glee,Where every merchant store was closedThat erst its glittering wares exposed,Was like a dried up sea.Canto XLIX. The Crossing Of The Rivers.Now Ráma, ere the night was fled,O\\'er many a league of road had sped,Till, as his course he onward held,The morn the shades of night dispelled.The rites of holy dawn he paid,And all the country round surveyed.He saw, as still he hurried throughWith steeds which swift as arrows flew,Hamlets and groves with blossoms fair,And fields which showed the tillers\\' care,While from the clustered dwellings nearThe words of peasants reached his ear:\"Fie on our lord the king, whose soulIs yielded up to love control!Fie on the vile Kaikeyí! ShameOn that malicious sinful dame,Who, keenly bent on cruel deeds,No bounds of right and virtue heeds,But with her wicked art has sentSo good a prince to banishment,Wise, tender-hearted, ruling wellHis senses, in the woods to dwell.Ah cruel king! his heart of steelFor his own son no love could feel,Who with the sinless Ráma parts,The darling of the people hearts.\"These words he heard the peasants say,Who dwelt in hamlets by the way,And, lord of all the realm by right,Through Kosala pursued his flight.Through the auspicious flood, at last,Of Vedasrutí stream he passed,And onward to the place he spedBy Saint Agastya tenanted.Still on for many an hour he hied,And crossed the stream whose cooling tideRolls onward till she meets the sea,The herd-frequented Gomatí.(321)Borne by his rapid horses o\\'er,He reached that river further shore.And Syandiká, whose swan-loved streamResounded with the peacock scream.Then as he journeyed on his roadTo his Videhan bride he showedThe populous land which Manu oldTo King Ikshváku gave to hold.The glorious prince, the lord of menLooked on the charioteer, and thenVoiced like a wild swan, loud and clear,He spake these words and bade him hear:\"When shall I, with returning feetMy father and my mother meet?When shall I lead the hunt once moreIn bloomy woods on Sarjú shore?Most eagerly I long to rideUrging the chase on Sarjú side.For royal saints have seen no blameIn this, the monarch matchless game.\"Thus speeding on,--no rest or stay,--Ikshváku son pursued his way.Oft his sweet voice the silence broke,And thus on varied themes he spoke.Canto L. The Halt Under The Ingudí.(322)So through the wide and fair extentOf Kosala the hero went.Then toward Ayodhyá back he gazed,And cried, with suppliant hands upraised:\"Farewell, dear city, first in place,Protected by Kakutstha race!And Gods, who in thy temples dwell,And keep thine ancient citadel!I from his debt my sire will free,Thy well-loved towers again will see,And, coming from my wild retreat,My mother and my father meet.\"Then burning grief inflamed his eye,As his right arm he raised on high,And, while hot tears his cheek bedewed,Addressed the mournful multitude:\"By love and tender pity moved,Your love for me you well have proved;Now turn again with joy, and winSuccess in all your hands begin.\"Before the high souled chief they bent,With circling steps around him went,And then with bitter wailing, theyDeparted each his several way.Like the great sun engulfed by night,The hero sped beyond their sight,While still the people mourned his fateAnd wept aloud disconsolate.The car-borne chieftain passed the boundOf Kosala delightful ground,Where grain and riches bless the land,And people give with liberal hand:A lovely realm unvexed by fear,Where countless shrines and stakes(323) appear:Where mango-groves and gardens grow,And streams of pleasant water flow:Where dwells content a well-fed race,And countless kine the meadows grace:Filled with the voice of praise and prayer:Each hamlet worth a monarch care.Before him three-pathed Gangá rolledHer heavenly waters bright and cold;O\\'er her pure breast no weeds were spread,Her banks were hermit-visited.The car-borne hero saw the tideThat ran with eddies multiplied,And thus the charioteer addressed:\"Here on the bank to-day we rest.Not distant from the river, see!There grows a lofty IngudíWith blossoms thick on every spray:There rest we, charioteer, to-day.I on the queen of floods will gaze,Whose holy stream has highest praise,Where deer, and bird, and glittering snake,God, Daitya, bard their pastime take.\"Sumantra, Lakshman gave assent,And with the steeds they thither went.When Ráma reached the lovely tree,With Sítá and with Lakshman, heAlighted from the car: with speedSumantra loosed each weary steed.And, hand to hand in reverence laid,Stood near to Ráma in the shade.Ráma dear friend, renowned by fame,Who of Nisháda lineage came,Guha, the mighty chief, adoredThrough all the land as sovereign lord,Soon as he heard that prince renownedWas resting on Nisháda ground,Begirt by counsellor and peerAnd many an honoured friend drew near.Soon as the monarch came in view,Ráma and Lakshman toward him flew.Then Guha, at the sight distressed,His arms around the hero pressed,Laid both his hands upon his headBowed to those lotus feet, and said:\"O Ráma, make thy wishes known,And be this kingdom as thine own.Who, mighty-armed, will ever seeA guest so dear as thou to me?\"He placed before him dainty fareOf every flavour, rich and rare,Brought forth the gift for honoured guest,And thus again the chief addressed:\"Welcome, dear Prince, whose arms are strong;These lands and all to thee belong.Thy servants we, our lord art thou;Begin, good king, thine empire now.See, various food before thee placed,And cups to drink and sweets to tasteFor thee soft beds are hither borne,And for thy horses grass and corn.\"To Guha as he pressed and prayed,Thus Raghu son his answer made:\"\\'Twas aye thy care my heart to pleaseWith honour, love, and courtesies,And friendship brings thee now to greetThy guest thus humbly on thy feet.\"Again the hero spake, as roundThe king his shapely arms he wound:\"Guha, I see that all is wellWith thee and those who with thee dwell;That health and bliss and wealth attendThy realm, thyself, and every friend.But all these friendly gifts of thine,Bound to refuse, I must decline.Grass, bark, and hide my only wear,And woodland roots and fruit my fare,On duty all my heart is set;I seek the woods, an anchoret.A little grass and corn to feedThe horses--this is all I need.So by this favour, King, aloneShall honour due to me be shown.For these good steeds who brought me hereAre to my sire supremely dear;And kind attention paid to theseWill honour me and highly please.\"Then Guha quickly bade his trainGive water to the steeds, and grain.And Ráma, ere the night grew dark,Paid evening rites in dress of bark,And tasted water, on the strand,Drawn from the stream by Lakshman hand.And Lakshman with observance meetBathed his beloved brother feet,Who rested with his Maithil spouse:Then sat him down \\'neath distant boughs.And Guha with his bow sat nearTo Lakshman and the charioteer,And with the prince conversing keptHis faithful watch while Ráma slept.As Dasaratha glorious heir,Of lofty soul and wisdom rare,Reclining with his Sítá thereBeside the river lay--He who no troubles e\\'er had seen,Whose life a life of bliss had been--That night beneath the branches greenPassed pleasantly away.Canto LI. Lakshman Lament.As Lakshman still his vigil heldBy unaffected love impelled,Guha, whose heart the sight distressed,With words like these the prince addressed:\"Beloved youth, this pleasant bedWas brought for thee, for thee is spread;On this, my Prince, thine eyelids close,And heal fatigue with sweet repose.My men are all to labour trained,But hardship thou hast ne\\'er sustained.All we this night our watch will keepAnd guard Kakutstha son asleep.In all the world there breathes not oneMore dear to me than Raghu son.The words I speak, heroic youth,Are true: I swear it by my truth.Through his dear grace supreme renownWill, so I trust, my wishes crown.So shall my life rich store obtainOf merit, blest with joy and gain.While Raghu son and Sítá lieEntranced in happy slumber, IWill, with my trusty bow in hand,Guard my dear friend with all my band.To me, who oft these forests range,Is naught therein or new or strange.We could with equal might opposeA four-fold army led by foes.\"Then royal Lakshman made reply:\"With thee to stand as guardian nigh,Whose faithful soul regards the right,Fearless we well might rest to-night.But how, when Ráma lays his headWith Sítá on his lowly bed,--How can I sleep? how can I careFor life, or aught that bright and fair?Behold the conquering chief, whose mightIs match for Gods and fiends in fight;With Sítá now he rests his headAsleep on grass beneath him spread.Won by devotion, text, and prayer,And many a rite performed with care,Chief of our father sons he shinesWell marked, like him, with favouring signs.Brief, brief the monarch life will beNow his dear son is forced to flee;And quickly will the widowed stateMourn for her lord disconsolate.Each mourner there has wept her fill;The cries of anguish now are still:In the king hall each dame, o\\'ercomeWith weariness of woe is dumb.This first sad night of grief, I ween,Will do to death each sorrowing queen:Scarce is Kausalyá left alive;My mother, too, can scarce survive.If when her heart is fain to break,She lingers for Satrughna sake,Kausalyá, mother of the chief,Must sink beneath the chilling grief.That town which countless thousands fill,Whose hearts with love of Ráma thrill,--The world delight, so rich and fair,--Grieved for the king, his death will share.The hopes he fondly cherished, crossedAyodhyá throne to Ráma lost,--With mournful cries, Too late, too late!The king my sire will meet his fate.And when my sire has passed away,Most happy in their lot are they,Allowed, with every pious care,Part in his funeral rites to bear.And O, may we with joy at last,--These years of forest exile past,--Turn to Ayodhyá town to dwellWith him who keeps his promise well!\"While thus the hero mighty-souled,In wild lament his sorrow told,Faint with the load that on him lay,The hours of darkness passed away.As thus the prince, impelled by zealFor his loved brother, prompt to feelStrong yearnings for the people weal,His words of truth outspake,King Guha grieved to see his woe,Heart-stricken, gave his tears to flow,Tormented by the common blow,Sad, as a wounded snake.Canto LII. The Crossing Of Gangá.Soon as the shades of night had fled,Uprising from his lowly bed,Ráma the famous, broad of chest,His brother Lakshman thus addressed:\"Now swift upsprings the Lord of Light,And fled is venerable night.That dark-winged bird the Koďl nowIs calling from the topmost bough,And sounding from the thicket nighIs heard the peacock early cry.Come, cross the flood that seeks the sea,The swiftly flowing Jáhnaví.\"(324)King Guha heard his speech, agreed,And called his minister with speed:\"A boat,\" he cried, \"swift, strong, and fair,With rudder, oars, and men, prepare,And place it ready by the shoreTo bear the pilgrims quickly o\\'er.\"Thus Guha spake: his followers allBestirred them at their master call;Then told the king that ready mannedA gay boat waited near the strand.Then Guha, hand to hand applied,With reverence thus to Ráma cried:\"The boat is ready by the shore:How, tell me, can I aid thee more?O lord of men, it waits for theeTo cross the flood that seeks the sea.O godlike keeper of thy vow,Embark: the boat is ready now.\"Then Ráma, lord of glory high,Thus to King Guha made reply:\"Thanks for thy gracious care, my lord:Now let the gear be placed on board.\"Each bow-armed chief, in mail encased,Bound sword and quiver to his waist,And then with Sítá near them hiedDown the broad river shelving side.Then with raised palms the charioteer,In lowly reverence drawing near,Cried thus to Ráma good and true:\"Now what remains for me to do?\"With his right hand, while answeringThe hero touched his friend:\"Go back,\" he said, \"and on the kingWith watchful care attend.Thus far, Sumantra, thou wast guide;Now to Ayodhyá turn,\" he cried:\"Hence seek we leaving steeds and car,On foot the wood that stretches far.\"Sumantra, when, with grieving heart,He heard the hero bid him part,Thus to the bravest of the brave,Ikshváku son, his answer gave:\"In all the world men tell of naught,To match thy deed, by heroes wrought--Thus with thy brother and thy wifeThrall-like to lead a forest life.No meet reward of fruit repaysThy holy lore, thy saintlike days,Thy tender soul, thy love of truth,If woe like this afflicts thy youth.Thou, roaming under forest boughsWith thy dear brother and thy spouseShalt richer meed of glory gainThan if three worlds confessed thy reign.Sad is our fate, O Ráma: we,Abandoned and repelled by thee,Must serve as thralls Kaikeyí will,Imperious, wicked, born to ill.\"Thus cried the faithful charioteer,As Raghu son, in rede his peer,Was fast departing on his road,--And long his tears of anguish flowed.But Ráma, when those tears were driedHis lips with water purified,And in soft accents, sweet and clear,Again addressed the charioteer:\"I find no heart, my friend, like thine,So faithful to Ikshváku line.Still first in view this object keep,That ne\\'er for me my sire may weep.For he, the world far-ruling king,Is old, and wild with sorrow sting;With love great burthen worn and weak:Deem this the cause that thus I speakWhate\\'er the high-souled king decreesHis loved Kaikeyí heart to please,Yea, be his order what it may,Without demur thou must obey,For this alone great monarchs reign,That ne\\'er a wish be formed in vain.Then, O Sumantra, well provideThat by no check the king be tried:Nor let his heart in sorrow pine:This care, my faithful friend, be thine.The honoured king my father greet,And thus for me my words repeatTo him whose senses are controlled,Untired till now by grief, and old;\"I, Sítá, Lakshman sorrow not,O Monarch, for our altered lot:The same to us, if here we roam,Or if Ayodhyá be our home,The fourteen years will quickly fly,The happy hour will soon be nighWhen thou, my lord, again shalt seeLakshman, the Maithil dame, and me.\"Thus having soothed, O charioteer,My father and my mother dear,Let all the queens my message learn,But to Kaikeyí chiefly turn.With loving blessings from the three,From Lakshman, Sítá, and from me,My mother, Queen Kausalyá, greetWith reverence to her sacred feet.And add this prayer of mine: \"O King;Send quickly forth and Bharat bring,And set him on the royal throneWhich thy decree has made his own.When he upon the throne is placed,When thy fond arms are round him laced,Thine aged heart will cease to acheWith bitter pangs for Ráma sake.\"And say to Bharat: \"See thou treatThe queens with all observance meet:What care the king receives, the sameShow thou alike to every dame.Obedience to thy father willWho chooses thee the throne to fill,Will earn for thee a store of blissBoth in the world to come and this.\\' \"Thus Ráma bade Sumantra goWith thoughtful care instructed so.Sumantra all his message heard,And spake again, by passion stirred:\"O, should deep feeling mar in aughtThe speech by fond devotion taught,Forgive whate\\'er I wildly speak:My love is strong, my tongue is weak.How shall I, if deprived of thee,Return that mournful town to see:Where sick at heart the people areBecause their Ráma roams afar.Woe will be theirs too deep to brookWhen on the empty car they look,As when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,One charioteer comes home again.This very day, I ween, is foodForsworn by all the multitude,Thinking that thou, with hosts to aid,Art dwelling in the wild wood shade.The great despair, the shriek of woeThey uttered when they saw thee go,Will, when I come with none beside,A hundred-fold be multiplied.How to Kausalyá can I say:\"O Queen, I took thy son away,And with thy brother left him well:Weep not for him; thy woe dispel?\"So false a tale I cannot frame,Yet how speak truth and grieve the dame?How shall these horses, fleet and bold,Whom not a hand but mine can hold,Bear others, wont to whirl the carWherein Ikshváku children are!Without thee, Prince, I cannot, no,I cannot to Ayodhyá go.Then deign, O Ráma, to relent,And let me share thy banishment.But if no prayers can move thy heart,If thou wilt quit me and depart,The flames shall end my car and me,Deserted thus and reft of thee.In the wild wood when foes are near,When dangers check thy vows austere,Borne in my car will I attend,All danger and all care to end.For thy dear sake I love the skillThat guides the steed and curbs his will:And soon a forest life will beAs pleasant, for my love of thee.And if these horses near thee dwell,And serve thee in the forest well,They, for their service, will not missThe due reward of highest bliss.Thine orders, as with thee I stray,Will I with heart and head obey,Prepared, for thee, without a sigh,To lose Ayodhyá or the sky.As one defiled with hideous sin,I never more can pass withinAyodhyá, city of our king,Unless beside me thee I bring.One wish is mine, I ask no more,That, when thy banishment is o\\'erI in my car may bear my lord,Triumphant, to his home restored.The fourteen years, if spent with thee,Will swift as light-winged moments flee;But the same years, without thee told,Were magnified a hundred-fold.Do not, kind lord, thy servant leave,Who to his master son would cleave,And the same path with him pursue,Devoted, tender, just and true.\"Again, again Sumantra madeHis varied plaint, and wept and prayed.Him Raghu son, whose tender breastFelt for his servants, thus addressed:\"O faithful servant, well my heartKnows how attached and true thou art.Hear thou the words I speak, and knowWhy to the town I bid thee go.Soon as Kaikeyí, youngest queen,Thy coming to the town has seen,No doubt will then her mind oppressThat Ráma roams the wilderness.And so the dame, her heart contentWith proof of Ráma banishment,Will doubt the virtuous king no moreAs faithless to the oath he swore.Chief of my cares is this, that she,Youngest amid the queens, may seeBharat her son securely reignO\\'er rich Ayodhyá wide domain.For mine and for the monarch sakeDo thou thy journey homeward take,And, as I bade, repeat each wordThat from my lips thou here hast heard.\"Thus spake the prince, and strove to cheerThe sad heart of the charioteer,And then to royal Guha saidThese words most wise and spirited:\"Guha, dear friend, it is not meetThat people throng my calm retreat:For I must live a strict recluse,And mould my life by hermits\\' use.I now the ancient rule acceptBy good ascetics gladly kept.I go: bring fig-tree juice that IIn matted coils my hair may tie.\"Quick Guha hastened to produce,For the king son, that sacred juice.Then Ráma of his long locks made,And Lakshman too, the hermit braid.And the two royal brothers thereWith coats of bark and matted hair,Transformed in lovely likeness stoodTo hermit saints who love the wood.So Ráma, with his brother bold,A pious anchorite enrolled,Obeyed the vow which hermits take,And to his friend, King Guha, spake:\"May people, treasure, army share,And fenced forts, thy constant care:Attend to all: supremely hardThe sovereign task, to watch and guard.\"Ikshváku son, the good and brave,This last farewell to Guha gave,And then, with Lakshman and his bride,Determined, on his way he hied.Soon as he viewed, upon the shore,The bark prepared to waft them o\\'erImpetuous Gangá rolling tide,To Lakshman thus the chieftain cried:\"Brother, embark; thy hand extend,Thy gentle aid to Sítá lend:With care her trembling footsteps guide,And place the lady by thy side.\"When Lakshman heard, prepared to aid,His brother words he swift obeyed.Within the bark he placed the dame,Then to her side the hero came.Next Lakshman elder brother, lordOf brightest glory, when on board,Breathing a prayer for blessings, meetFor priest or warrior to repeat,Then he and car-borne Lakshman bent,Well-pleased, their heads, most reverent,Their hands, with Sítá, having dipped,As Scripture bids, and water sipped,Farewell to wise Sumantra said,And Guha, with the train he led.So Ráma took, on board, his stand,And urged the vessel from the land.Then swift by vigorous arms impelledHer onward course the vessel held,And guided by the helmsman throughThe dashing waves of Gangá flew.Half way across the flood they came,When Sítá, free from spot and blame,Her reverent hands together pressed,The Goddess of the stream addressed:\"May the great chieftain here who springsFrom Dasaratha, best of kings,Protected by thy care, fulfilHis prudent father royal will.When in the forest he has spentHis fourteen years of banishment,With his dear brother and with meHis home again my lord shall see.Returning on that blissful day,I will to thee mine offerings pay,Dear Queen, whose waters gently flow,Who canst all blessed gifts bestow.For, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,Thy waves descend from Brahmá sphere,Spouse of the God o\\'er floods supreme,Though rolling here thy glorious stream.To thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,To thee shall hymns of praise ascend,When my brave lord shall turn again,And, joyful, o\\'er his kingdom reign.To win thy grace, O Queen divine,A hundred thousand fairest kine,And precious robes and finest mealAmong the Bráhmans will I deal.A hundred jars of wine shall flow,When to my home, O Queen, I go;With these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,Will I, delighted, sacrifice.Each hallowed spot, each holy shrineThat stands on these fair shores of thine,Each fane and altar on thy banksShall share my offerings and thanks.With me and Lakshman, free from harm,May he the blameless, strong of arm,Reseek Ayodhyá from the wild,O blameless Lady undefiled!\"As, praying for her husband sake,The faultless dame to Gangá spake,To the right bank the vessel flewWith her whose heart was right and true.Soon as the bark had crossed the wave,The lion leader of the brave,Leaving the vessel on the strand,With wife and brother leapt to land.Then Ráma thus the prince addressedWho filled with joy Sumitrá breast:\"Be thine alike to guard and aidIn peopled spot, in lonely shade.Do thou, Sumitrá son, precede:Let Sítá walk where thou shalt lead.Behind you both my place shall be,To guard the Maithil dame and thee.For she, to woe a stranger yet,No toil or grief till now has met;The fair Videhan will assayThe pains of forest life to-day.To-day her tender feet must treadRough rocky wilds around her spread:No tilth is there, no gardens grow,No crowding people come and go.\"The hero ceased: and Lakshman ledObedient to the words he said:And Sítá followed him, and thenCame Raghu pride, the lord of men.With Sítá walking o\\'er the sandThey sought the forest, bow in hand,But still their lingering glances threwWhere yet Sumantra stood in view.Sumantra, when his watchful eyeThe royal youths no more could spy,Turned from the spot whereon he stoodHomeward with Guha from the wood.Still on the brothers forced their wayWhere sweet birds sang on every spray,Though scarce the eye a path could findMid flowering trees where creepers twined.Far on the princely brothers pressed,And stayed their feet at length to restBeneath a fig tree mighty shadeWith countless pendent shoots displayed.Reclining there a while at ease,They saw, not far, beneath fair treesA lake with many a lotus brightThat bore the name of Lovely Sight.Ráma his wife attention drew,And Lakshman, to the charming view:\"Look, brother, look how fair the floodGlows with the lotus, flower and bud!\"They drank the water fresh and clear,And with their shafts they slew a deer.A fire of boughs they made in haste,And in the flame the meat they placed.So Raghu sons with Sítá sharedThe hunter meal their hands prepared,Then counselled that the spreading treeTheir shelter and their home should be.Canto LIII. Ráma Lament.When evening rites were duly paid,Reclined beneath the leafy shade,To Lakshman thus spake Ráma, bestOf those who glad a people breast:\"Now the first night has closed the dayThat saw us from our country stray,And parted from the charioteer;Yet grieve not thou, my brother dear.Henceforth by night, when others sleep,Must we our careful vigil keep,Watching for Sítá welfare thus,For her dear life depends on us.Bring me the leaves that lie around,And spread them here upon the ground,That we on lowly beds may lie,And let in talk the night go by.\"So on the ground with leaves o\\'erspread,He who should press a royal bed,Ráma with Lakshman thus conversed,And many a pleasant tale rehearsed:\"This night the king,\" he cried, \"alas!In broken sleep will sadly pass.Kaikeyí now content should be,For mistress of her wish is she.So fiercely she for empire yearns,That when her Bharat home returns,She in her greed, may even bringDestruction on our lord the king.What can he do, in feeble eld,Reft of all aid and me expelled,His soul enslaved by love, a thrallObedient to Kaikeyí call?As thus I muse upon his woeAnd all his wisdoms overthrow,Love is, methinks, of greater mightTo stir the heart than gain and right.For who, in wisdom lore untaught,Could by a beauty prayer be boughtTo quit his own obedient son,Who loves him, as my sire has done!Bharat, Kaikeyí child, aloneWill, with his wife, enjoy the throne,And blissfully his rule maintainO\\'er happy Kosala domain.To Bharat single lot will fallThe kingdom and the power and all,When fails the king from length of days,And Ráma in the forest strays.Whoe\\'er, neglecting right and gain,Lets conquering love his soul enchain,To him, like Dasaratha lot,Comes woe with feet that tarry not.Methinks at last the royal dame,Dear Lakshman, has secured her aim,To see at once her husband dead,Her son enthroned, and Ráma fled.Ah me! I fear, lest borne awayBy frenzy of success, she slayKausalyá, through her wicked hateOf me, bereft, disconsolate;Or her who aye for me has strivenSumitrá, to devotion given.Hence, Lakshman, to Ayodhyá speed,Returning in the hour of need.With Sítá I my steps will bendWhere Dandak mighty woods extend.No guardian has Kausalyá now:O, be her friend and guardian thou.Strong hate may vile Kaikeyí leadTo many a base unrighteous deed,Treading my mother \\'neath her feetWhen Bharat holds the royal seat.Sure in some antenatal timeWere children, by Kausalyá crime,Torn from their mothers\\' arms away,And hence she mourns this evil day.She for her child no toil would spareTending me long with pain and care;Now in the hour of fruitage sheHas lost that son, ah, woe is me.O Lakshman, may no matron e\\'erA son so doomed to sorrow bearAs I, my mother heart who rendWith anguish that can never end.The Sáriká,(325) methinks, possessedMore love than glows in Ráma breast.Who, as the tale is told to us,Addressed the stricken parrot thus:\"Parrot, the capturer talons tear,While yet alone thou flutterest there,Before his mouth has closed on me:\"So cried the bird, herself to free.Reft of her son, in childless woe,My mother tears for ever flow:Ill-fated, doomed with grief to strive,What aid can she from me derive?Pressed down by care, she cannot riseFrom sorrow flood wherein she lies.In righteous wrath my single armCould, with my bow, protect from harmAyodhyá town and all the earth:But what is hero prowess worth?Lest breaking duty law I sin,And lose the heaven I strive to win,The forest life today I choose,And kingly state and power refuse.\"Thus mourning in that lonely spotThe troubled chief bewailed his lot,And filled with tears, his eyes ran o\\'er;Then silent sat, and spake no more.To him, when ceased his loud lament,Like fire whose brilliant might is spent,Or the great sea when sleeps the wave,Thus Lakshman consolation gave:\"Chief of the brave who bear the bow,E\\'en now Ayodhyá, sunk in woe,By thy departure reft of lightIs gloomy as the moonless night.Unfit it seems that thou, O chief,Shouldst so afflict thy soul with grief,So with thou Sítá heart consignTo deep despair as well as mine.Not I, O Raghu son, nor sheCould live one hour deprived of thee:We were, without thine arm to save,Like fish deserted by the wave.Although my mother dear to meet,Satrughna, and the king, were sweet,On them, or heaven, to feed mine eyeWere nothing, if thou wert not by.\"Sitting at ease, their glances fellUpon the beds, constructed well,And there the sons of virtue laidTheir limbs beneath the fig tree shade.Canto LIV. Bharadvája Hermitage.So there that night the heroes spentUnder the boughs that o\\'er them bent,And when the sun his glory spread,Upstarting, from the place they sped.On to that spot they made their way,Through the dense wood that round them lay,Where Yamuná(326) swift waters glideTo blend with Gangá holy tide.Charmed with the prospect ever newThe glorious heroes wandered throughFull many a spot of pleasant ground,Rejoicing as they gazed around,With eager eye and heart at ease,On countless sorts of flowery trees.And now the day was half-way spedWhen thus to Lakshman Ráma said:\"There, there, dear brother, turn thine eyes;See near Prayág(327) that smoke arise:The banner of our Lord of FlamesThe dwelling of some saint proclaims.Near to the place our steps we bendWhere Yamuná and Gangá blend.I hear and mark the deafening roarWhen chafing floods together pour.See, near us on the ground are leftDry logs, by labouring woodmen cleft,And the tall trees, that blossom nearSaint Bharadvája home, appear.\"The bow-armed princes onward passed,And as the sun was sinking fastThey reached the hermit dwelling, setNear where the rushing waters met.The presence of the warrior scaredThe deer and birds as on he fared,And struck them with unwonted awe:Then Bharadvája cot they saw.The high-souled hermit soon they foundGirt by his dear disciples round:Calm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,Whose fervent rites keen sight had bought.Duly had flames of worship blazedWhen Ráma on the hermit gazed:His suppliant hands the hero raised,Drew nearer to the holy manWith his companions, and began,Declaring both his name and raceAnd why they sought that distant place:\"Saint, Dasaratha children we,Ráma and Lakshman, come to thee.This my good wife from Janak springs,The best of fair Videha kings;Through lonely wilds, a faultless dame,To this pure grove with me she came.My younger brother follows stillMe banished by my father will:Sumitrá son, bound by a vow,--He roams the wood beside me now.Sent by my father forth to rove,We seek, O Saint, some holy grove,Where lives of hermits we may lead,And upon fruits and berries feed.\"When Bharadvája, prudent-souled,Had heard the prince his tale unfold,Water he bade them bring, a bull,And honour-gifts in dishes full,And drink and food of varied taste,Berries and roots, before him placed,And then the great ascetic showedA cottage for the guests\\' abode.The saint these honours gladly paidTo Ráma who had thither strayed,Then compassed sat by birds and deerAnd many a hermit resting near.The prince received the service kind,And sat him down rejoiced in mind.Then Bharadvája silence broke,And thus the words of duty spoke:\"Kakutstha royal son, that thouHadst sought this grove I knew ere now.Mine ears have heard thy story, sentWithout a sin to banishment.Behold, O Prince, this ample spaceNear where the mingling floods embrace,Holy, and beautiful, and clear:Dwell with us, and be happy here.\"By Bharadvája thus addressed,Ráma whose kind and tender breastAll living things would bless and save,In gracious words his answer gave:\"My honoured lord, this tranquil spot,Fair home of hermits, suits me not:For all the neighbouring people hereWill seek us when they know me near:With eager wish to look on me,And the Videhan dame to see,A crowd of rustics will intrudeUpon the holy solitude.Provide, O gracious lord, I pray,Some quiet home that lies away,Where my Videhan spouse may dwellTasting the bliss deserved so well.\"The hermit heard the prayer he made:A while in earnest thought he stayed,And then in words like these expressedHis answer to the chief request:\"Ten leagues away there stands a hillWhere thou mayst live, if such thy will:A holy mount, exceeding fair;Great saints have made their dwelling there:There great Langúrs(328) in thousands play,And bears amid the thickets stray;Wide-known by Chitrakúta name,It rivals Gandhamádan(329) fame.Long as the man that hill who seeksGazes upon its sacred peaks,To holy things his soul he givesAnd pure from thought of evil lives.There, while a hundred autumns fled,Has many a saint with hoary headSpent his pure life, and won the prize,By deep devotion, in the skies:Best home, I ween, if such retreat,Far from the ways of men, be sweet:Or let thy years of exile fleeHere in this hermitage with me.\"Thus Bharadvája spake, and trainedIn lore of duty, entertainedThe princes and the dame, and pressedHis friendly gifts on every guest.Thus to Prayág the hero went,Thus saw the saint preëminent,And varied speeches heard and said:Then holy night o\\'er heaven was spread.And Ráma took, by toil oppressed,With Sítá and his brother, rest;And so the night, with sweet content,In Bharadvája grove was spent.But when the dawn dispelled the night,Ráma approached the anchorite,And thus addressed the holy sireWhose glory shone like kindled fire:\"Well have we spent, O truthful Sage,The night within thy hermitage:Now let my lord his guests permitFor their new home his grove to quit.\"Then, as he saw the morning break,In answer Bharadvája spake:\"Go forth to Chitrakúta hill,Where berries grow, and sweets distil:Full well, I deem, that home will suitThee, Ráma, strong and resolute.Go forth, and Chitrakúta seek,Famed mountain of the Varied Peak.In the wild woods that gird him roundAll creatures of the chase are found:Thou in the glades shalt see appearVast herds of elephants and deer.With Sítá there shalt thou delightTo gaze upon the woody height;There with expanding heart to lookOn river, table-land, and brook,And see the foaming torrent raveImpetuous from the mountain cave.Auspicious hill! where all day longThe lapwing cry, the Koďl songMake all who listen gay:Where all is fresh and fair to see,Where elephants and deer roam free,There, as a hermit, stay.\"Canto LV. The Passage Of Yamuná.The princely tamers of their foesThus passed the night in calm repose,Then to the hermit having bentWith reverence, on their way they went.High favour Bharadvája showed,And blessed them ready for the road.With such fond looks as fathers throwOn their own sons, before they go.Then spake the saint with glory brightTo Ráma peerless in his might:\"First, lords of men, direct your feetWhere Yamuná and Gangá meet;Then to the swift Kálindí(330) go,Whose westward waves to Gangá flow.When thou shalt see her lovely shoreWorn by their feet who hasten o\\'er,Then, Raghu son, a raft prepare,And cross the Sun born river there.Upon her farther bank a tree,Near to the landing wilt thou see.The blessed source of varied gifts,There her green boughs that Fig-tree lifts:A tree where countless birds abide,By Syáma name known far and wide.Sítá, revere that holy shade:There be thy prayers for blessing prayed.Thence for a league your way pursue,And a dark wood shall meet your view,Where tall bamboos their foliage show,The Gum-tree and the Jujube grow.To Chitrakúta have I oftTrodden that path so smooth and soft,Where burning woods no traveller scare,But all is pleasant, green, and fair.\"When thus the guests their road had learned,Back to his cot the hermit turned,And Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá paidTheir reverent thanks for courteous aid.Thus Ráma spake to Lakshman, whenThe saint had left the lords of men:\"Great store of bliss in sooth is oursOn whom his love the hermit showers.\"As each to other wisely talked,The lion lords together walkedOn to Kálindí woody shore;And gentle Sítá went before.They reached that flood, whose waters fleeWith rapid current to the sea;Their minds a while to thought they gaveAnd counselled how to cross the wave.At length, with logs together laid,A mighty raft the brothers made.Then dry bamboos across were tied,And grass was spread from side to side.And the great hero Lakshman broughtCane and Rose-Apple boughs and wrought,Trimming the branches smooth and neat,For Sítá use a pleasant seat.And Ráma placed thereon his dameTouched with a momentary shame,Resembling in her glorious mienAll-thought-surpassing Fortune Queen.Then Ráma hastened to dispose,Each in its place, the skins and bows,And by the fair Videhan laidThe coats, the ornaments, and spade.When Sítá thus was set on board,And all their gear was duly stored,The heroes each with vigorous hand,Pushed off the raft and left the land.When half its way the raft had made,Thus Sítá to Kálindí prayed:\"Goddess, whose flood I traverse now,Grant that my lord may keep his vow.For thee shall bleed a thousand kine,A hundred jars shall pour their wine,When Ráma sees that town againWhere old Ikshváku children reign.\"Thus to Kálindí stream she suedAnd prayed in suppliant attitude.Then to the river bank the dame,Fervent in supplication, came.They left the raft that brought them o\\'er,And the thick wood that clothed the shore,And to the Fig-tree Syáma madeTheir way, so cool with verdant shade.Then Sítá viewed that best of trees,And reverent spake in words like these:\"Hail, hail, O mighty tree! AllowMy husband to complete his vow;Let us returning, I entreat,Kausalyá and Sumitrá meet.\"Then with her hands together placedAround the tree she duly paced.When Ráma saw his blameless spouseA suppliant under holy boughs,The gentle darling of his heart,He thus to Lakshman spake apart:\"Brother, by thee our way be led;Let Sítá close behind thee tread:I, best of men, will grasp my bow,And hindmost of the three will go.What fruits soe\\'er her fancy take,Or flowers half hidden in the brake,For Janak child forget not thouTo gather from the brake or bough.\"Thus on they fared. The tender dameAsked Ráma, as they walked, the nameOf every shrub that blossoms bore,Creeper, and tree unseen before:And Lakshman fetched, at Sítá prayer,Boughs of each tree with clusters fair.Then Janak daughter joyed to seeThe sand-discoloured river flee,Where the glad cry of many a bird,The sáras and the swan, was heard.A league the brothers travelled throughThe forest noble game they slew:Beneath the trees their meal they dressedAnd sat them down to eat and rest.A while in that delightful shadeWhere elephants unnumbered strayed,Where peacocks screamed and monkeys played,They wandered with delight.Then by the river side they foundA pleasant spot of level ground,Where all was smooth and fair around,Their lodging for the night.Canto LVI. ChitrakútaThen Ráma, when the morning rose,Called Lakshman gently from repose:\"Awake, the pleasant voices hearOf forest birds that warble near.Scourge of thy foes, no longer stay;The hour is come to speed away.\"The slumbering prince unclosed his eyesWhen thus his brother bade him rise,Compelling, at the timely cry,Fatigue, and sleep, and rest to fly.The brothers rose and Sítá too;Pure water from the stream they drew,Paid morning rites, then followed stillThe road to Chitrakúta hill.Then Ráma as he took the roadWith Lakshman, while the morning, glowed,To the Videhan lady cried,Sítá the fair, the lotus-eyed:\"Look round thee, dear; each flowery treeTouched with the fire of morning see:The Kinsuk, now the Frosts are fled,--How glorious with his wreaths of red!The Bel-trees see, so loved of men,Hanging their boughs in every glen.O\\'erburthened with their fruit and flowers:A plenteous store of food is ours.See, Lakshman, in the leafy trees,Where\\'er they make their home.Down hangs, the work of labouring beesThe ponderous honeycomb.In the fair wood before us spreadThe startled wild-cock cries:Hark, where the flowers are soft to tread,The peacock voice replies.Where elephants are roaming free,And sweet birds\\' songs are loud,The glorious Chitrakúta see:His peaks are in the cloud.On fair smooth ground he stands displayed,Begirt by many a tree:O brother, in that holy shadeHow happy shall we be!\"(331)Then Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá, eachSpoke raising suppliant hands this speechTo him, in woodland dwelling met,Válmíki, ancient anchoret:\"O Saint, this mountain takes the mind,With creepers, trees of every kind,With fruit and roots abounding thus,A pleasant life it offers us:Here for a while we fain would stay,And pass a season blithe and gay.\"Then the great saint, in duty trained,With honour gladly entertained:He gave his guests a welcome fair,And bade them sit and rest them there,Ráma of mighty arm and chestHis faithful Lakshman then addressed:\"Brother, bring hither from the woodSelected timber strong and good,And build therewith a little cot;My heart rejoices in the spotThat lies beneath the mountain side,Remote, with water well supplied.\"Sumitrá son his words obeyed,Brought many a tree, and deftly made,With branches in the forest cut,As Ráma bade, a leafy hut.Then Ráma, when the cottage stoodFair, firmly built, and walled with wood,To Lakshman spake, whose eager mindTo do his brother will inclined:\"Now, Lakshman as our cot is made,Must sacrifice be duly paidBy us, for lengthened life who hope,With venison of the antelope.Away, O bright-eyed Lakshman, speed:Struck by thy bow a deer must bleed:As Scripture bids, we must not slightThe duty that commands the rite.\"Lakshman, the chief whose arrows laidHis foemen low, his word obeyed;And Ráma thus again addressedThe swift performer of his hest:\"Prepare the venison thou hast shot,To sacrifice for this our cot.Haste, brother dear, for this the hour,And this the day of certain power.\"Then glorious Lakshman took the buckHis arrow in the wood had struck;Bearing his mighty load he came,And laid it in the kindled flame.Soon as he saw the meat was done,And that the juices ceased to runFrom the broiled carcass, Lakshman thenSpoke thus to Ráma best of men:\"The carcass of the buck, entire,Is ready dressed upon the fire.Now be the sacred rites begunTo please the God, thou godlike one.\"Ráma the good, in ritual trained,Pure from the bath, with thoughts restrained,Hasted those verses to repeatWhich make the sacrifice complete.The hosts celestial came in view,And Ráma to the cot withdrew,While a sweet sense of rapture stoleThrough the unequalled hero soul.He paid the Visvedevas(332) due.And Rudra right, and Vishnu too,Nor wonted blessings, to protectTheir new-built home, did he neglect.With voice repressed he breathed the prayer,Bathed duly in the river fair,And gave good offerings that removeThe stain of sin, as texts approve.And many an altar there he made,And shrines, to suit the holy shade,All decked with woodland chaplets sweet,And fruit and roots and roasted meat,With muttered prayer, as texts require,Water, and grass and wood and fire.So Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá paidTheir offerings to each God and shade,And entered then their pleasant cotThat bore fair signs of happy lot.They entered, the illustrious three,The well-set cottage, fair to see,Roofed with the leaves of many a tree,And fenced from wind and rain:So, at their Father Brahmá call,The Gods of heaven, assembling all,To their own glorious council hallAdvance in shining train.So, resting on that lovely hill,Near the fair lily-covered rill,The happy prince forgot,Surrounded by the birds and deer,The woe, the longing, and the fearThat gloom the exile lot.Canto LVII. Sumantra Return.When Ráma reached the southern bank,King Guha heart with sorrow sank:He with Sumantra talked, and spentWith his deep sorrow, homeward went.Sumantra, as the king decreed,Yoked to the car each noble steed,And to Ayodhyá city spedWith his sad heart disquieted.On lake and brook and scented groveHis glances fell, as on he drove:City and village came in viewAs o\\'er the road his coursers flew.On the third day the charioteer,When now the hour of night was near,Came to Ayodhyá gate, and foundThe city all in sorrow drowned.To him, in spirit quite cast down,Forsaken seemed the silent town,And by the rush of grief oppressedHe pondered in his mournful breast:\"Is all Ayodhyá burnt with grief,Steed, elephant, and man, and chief?Does her loved Ráma exile soAfflict her with the fires of woe?\"Thus as he mused, his steeds flew fast,And swiftly through the gate he passed.On drove the charioteer, and thenIn hundreds, yea in thousands, menRan to the car from every side,And, \"Ráma, where is Ráma?\" cried.Sumantra said: \"My chariot boreThe duteous prince to Gangá shore;I left him there at his behest,And homeward to Ayodhyá pressed.\"Soon as the anxious people knewThat he was o\\'er the flood they drewDeep sighs, and crying, Ráma! allWailed, and big tears began to fall.He heard the mournful words prolonged,As here and there the people thronged:\"Woe, woe for us, forlorn, undone,No more to look on Raghu son!His like again we ne\\'er shall see,Of heart so true, of hand so free,In gifts, in gatherings for debate,When marriage pomps we celebrate,What should we do? What earthly thingCan rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?\"Thus the sad town, which Ráma keptAs a kind father, wailed and wept.Each mansion, as the car went by,Sent forth a loud and bitter cry,As to the window every dame,Mourning for banished Ráma, came.As his sad eyes with tears o\\'erflowed,He sped along the royal roadTo Dasaratha high abode.There leaping down his car he stayed;Within the gates his way he made;Through seven broad courts he onward hiedWhere people thronged on every side.From each high terrace, wild with woe,The royal ladies flocked below:He heard them talk in gentle tone,As each for Ráma made her moan:\"What will the charioteer replyTo Queen Kausalyá eager cry?With Ráma from the gates he went;Homeward alone, his steps are bent.Hard is a life with woe distressed,But difficult to win is rest,If, when her son is banished, stillShe lives beneath her load of ill.\"Such was the speech Sumantra heardFrom them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.As fires of anguish burnt him through,Swift to the monarch hall he drew,Past the eighth court; there met his sight,The sovereign in his palace bright,Still weeping for his son, forlorn,Pale, faint, and all with sorrow worn.As there he sat, Sumantra bentAnd did obeisance reverent,And to the king repeated o\\'erThe message he from Ráma bore.The monarch heard, and well-nigh brakeHis heart, but yet no word he spake:Fainting to earth he fell, and dumb,By grief for Ráma overcome.Rang through the hall a startling cry,And women arms were tossed on high,When, with his senses all astray,Upon the ground the monarch lay.Kausalyá, with Sumitrá aid,Raised from the ground her lord dismayed:\"Sire, of high fate,\" she cried, \"O, whyDost thou no single word replyTo Ráma messenger who bringsNews of his painful wanderings?The great injustice done, art thouShame-stricken for thy conduct now?Rise up, and do thy part: bestowComfort and help in this our woe.Speak freely, King; dismiss thy fear,For Queen Kaikeyí stands not near,Afraid of whom thou wouldst not seekTidings of Ráma: freely speak.\"When the sad queen had ended so,She sank, insatiate in her woe,And prostrate lay upon the ground,While her faint voice by sobs was drowned.When all the ladies in despairSaw Queen Kausalyá wailing there,And the poor king oppressed with pain,They flocked around and wept again.Canto LVIII. Ráma Message.The king a while had senseless lain,When care brought memory back again.Then straight he called, the news to hearOf Ráma, for the charioteer,With reverent hand to hand appliedHe waited by the old man side,Whose mind with anguish was distraughtLike a great elephant newly caught.The king with bitter pain distressedThe faithful charioteer addressed,Who, sad of mien, with flooded eye,And dust upon his limbs, stood by:\"Where will be Ráma dwelling nowAt some tree foot, beneath the bough;Ah, what will be the exile food,Bred up with kind solicitude?Can he, long lapped in pleasant rest,Unmeet for pain, by pain oppressed,Son of earth king, his sad night spendEarth-couched, as one that has no friend?Behind him, when abroad he sped,Cars, elephant, and foot were led:Then how shall Ráma dwell afarIn the wild woods where no men are?How, tell me, did the princes there,With Sítá good and soft and fair,Alighting from the chariot, treadThe forest wilds around them spread?A happy lot is thine, I ween,Whose eyes my two dear sons have seenSeeking on foot the forest shade,Like the bright Twins to view displayed,The heavenly Asvins, when they seekThe woods that hang \\'neath Mandar peak.What words, Sumantra, quickly tell,From Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá fell?How in the wood did Ráma eat?What was his bed, and what his seat?Full answer to my questions give,For I on thy replies shall live,As with the saints Yayáti heldSweet converse, from the skies expelled.\"Urged by the lord of men to speak,Whose sobbing voice came faint and weak,Thus he, while tears his utterance broke,In answer to the monarch spoke:\"Hear then the words that Ráma said,Resolved in duty path to tread.Joining his hands, his head he bent,And gave this message, reverent:\"Sumantra, to my father go,Whose lofty mind all people know:Bow down before him, as is meet,And in my stead salute his feet.Then to the queen my mother bend,And give the greeting that I send:Ne\\'er may her steps from duty err,And may it still be well with her.And add this word: \"O Queen, pursueThy vows with faithful heart and true;And ever at due season turnWhere holy fires of worship burn.And, lady, on our lord bestowSuch honour as to Gods we owe.Be kind to every queen: let prideAnd thought of self be cast aside.In the king fond opinion raiseKaikeyí, by respect and praise.Let the young Bharat ever beLoved, honoured as the king by thee:Thy king-ward duty ne\\'er forget:High over all are monarchs set.\"And Bharat, too, for me address:Pray that all health his life may bless.Let every royal lady share,As justice bids, his love and care.Say to the strong-armed chief who bringsJoy to Iksváku line of kings:\"As ruling prince thy care be shownOf him, our sire, who holds the throne.Stricken in years he feels their weight;But leave him in his royal state.As regent heir content thee still,Submissive to thy father will.\\' \"Ráma again his charge renewed,As the hot flood his cheek bedewed:\"Hold as thine own my mother dearWho drops for me the longing tear.\"Then Lakshman, with his soul on fire,Spake breathing fast these words of ire:\"Say, for what sin, for what offenceWas royal Ráma banished thence?He is the cause, the king: poor slaveTo the light charge Kaikeyí gave.Let right or wrong the motive be,The author of our woe is he.Whether the exile were decreedThrough foolish faith or guilty greed,For promises or empire, stillThe king has wrought a grievous ill.Grant that the Lord of all saw fitTo prompt the deed and sanction it,In Ráma life no cause I seeFor which the king should bid him flee.His blinded eyes refused to scanThe guilt and folly of the plan,And from the weakness of the kingHere and hereafter woe shall spring.No more my sire: the ties that usedTo bind me to the king are loosed.My brother Ráma, Raghu son,To me is lord, friend, sire in one.The love of men how can he win,Deserting, by the cruel sin,Their joy, whose heart is swift to feelA pleasure in the people weal?Shall he whose mandate could expelThe virtuous Ráma, loved so well,To whom his subjects\\' fond hearts cling--Shall he in spite of them be king?\"But Janak child, my lord, stood by,And oft the votaress heaved a sigh.She seemed with dull and wandering sense,Beneath a spirit influence.The noble princess, pained with woeWhich till that hour she ne\\'er could know,Tears in her heavy trouble shed,But not a word to me she said.She raised her face which grief had driedAnd tenderly her husband eyed,Gazed on him as he turned to goWhile tear chased tear in rapid flow.\"Canto LIX. Dasaratha Lament.As thus Sumantra, best of peers,Told his sad tale with many tears,The monarch cried, \"I pray thee, tellAt length again what there befell.\"Sumantra, at the king behest,Striving with sobs he scarce repressed,His trembling voice at last controlled,And thus his further tidings told:\"Their locks in votive coils they wound,Their coats of bark upon them bound,To Gangá farther shore they went,Thence to Prayág their steps were bent.I saw that Lakshman walked aheadTo guard the path the two should tread.So far I saw, no more could learn,Forced by the hero to return.Retracing slow my homeward course,Scarce could I move each stubborn horse:Shedding hot tears of grief he stoodWhen Ráma turned him to the wood.(333)As the two princes parted thenceI raised my hands in reverence,Mounted my ready car, and boreThe grief that stung me to the core.With Guha all that day I stayed,Still by the earnest hope delayedThat Ráma, ere the time should end,Some message from the wood might send.Thy realms, great Monarch, mourn the blow,And sympathize with Ráma woe.Each withering tree hangs low his head,And shoot, and bud, and flower are dead.Dried are the floods that wont to fillThe lake, the river, and the rill.Drear is each grove and garden now,Dry every blossom on the bough.Each beast is still, no serpents crawl:A lethargy of woe on all.The very wood is silent: crushedWith grief for Ráma, all is hushed.Fair blossoms from the water born,Gay garlands that the earth adorn,And every fruit that gleams like gold,Have lost the scent that charmed of old.Empty is every grove I see,Or birds sit pensive on the tree.Where\\'er I look, its beauty o\\'er,The pleasance charms not as before.I drove through fair Ayodhyá street:None flew with joy the car to meet.They saw that Ráma was not there,And turned them sighing in despair.The people in the royal wayWept tears of bitter grief, when theyBeheld me coming, from afar,No Ráma with me in the car.From palace roof and turret highEach woman bent her eager eye;She looked for Ráma, but in vain;Gazed on the car and shrieked for pain.Their long clear eyes with sorrow drownedThey, when this common grief was found,Looked each on other, friend and foe,In sympathy of levelling woe:No shade of difference betweenFoe, friend, or neutral, there was seen.Without a joy, her bosom rentWith grief for Ráma banishment,Ayodhyá like the queen appearsWho mourns her son with many tears.\"He ended: and the king, distressed.With sobbing voice that lord addressed:\"Ah me, by false Kaikeyí led,Of evil race, to evil bred,I took no counsel of the sage,Nor sought advice from skill and age,I asked no lord his aid to lend,I called no citizen or friend.Rash was my deed, bereft of senseSlave to a woman influence.Surely, my lord, a woe so greatFalls on us by the will of Fate;It lays the house of Raghu low,For Destiny will have it so.I pray thee, if I e\\'er have doneAn act to please thee, yea, but one,Fly, fly, and Ráma homeward lead:My life, departing, counsels speed.Fly, ere the power to bid I lack,Fly to the wood: bring Ráma back.I cannot live for even oneShort hour bereaved of my son.But ah, the prince, whose arms are strong,Has journeyed far: the way is long:Me, me upon the chariot place,And let me look on Ráma face.Ah me, my son, mine eldest-born,Where roams he in the wood forlorn,The wielder of the mighty bow,Whose shoulders like the lion show?O, ere the light of life be dim,Take me to Sítá and to him.O Ráma, Lakshman, and O thouDear Sítá, constant to thy vow,Beloved ones, you cannot knowThat I am dying of my woe.\"The king to bitter grief a prey,That drove each wandering sense away,Sunk in affliction sea, too wideTo traverse, in his anguish cried:\"Hard, hard to pass, my Queen, this seaOf sorrow raging over me:No Ráma near to soothe mine eye,Plunged in its lowest deeps I lie.Sorrow for Ráma swells the tide,And Sítá absence makes it wide:My tears its foamy flood distain,Made billowy by my sighs of pain:My cries its roar, the arms I throwAbout me are the fish below,Kaikeyí is the fire that feedsBeneath: my hair the tangled weeds:Its source the tears for Ráma shed:The hump-back words its monsters dread:The boon I gave the wretch its shore,Till Ráma banishment be o\\'er.(334)Ah me, that I should long to setMy eager eyes to-dayOn Raghu son, and he be yetWith Lakshman far away!\"Thus he of lofty glory wailed,And sank upon the bed.Beneath the woe his spirit failed,And all his senses fled.Canto LX. Kausalyá Consoled.As Queen Kausalyá, trembling much,As blighted by a goblin touch,Still lying prostrate, half awokeTo consciousness, \\'twas thus she spoke:\"Bear me away, Sumantra, far,Where Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman are.Bereft of them I have no powerTo linger on a single hour.Again, I pray, thy steps retrace,And me in Dandak forest place,For after them I needs must go,Or sink to Yama realms below.\"His utterance choked by tears that rolledDown from their fountains uncontrolled,With suppliant hands the charioteerThus spake, the lady heart to cheer:\"Dismiss thy grief, despair, and dreadThat fills thy soul, of sorrow bred,For pain and anguish thrown aside,Will Ráma in the wood abide.And Lakshman, with unfailing careWill guard the feet of Ráma there,Earning, with governed sense, the prizeThat waits on duty in the skies.And Sítá in the wild as wellAs in her own dear home will dwell;To Ráma all her heart she gives,And free from doubt and terror lives.No faintest sign of care or woeThe features of the lady show:Methinks Videha pride was madeFor exile in the forest shade.E\\'en as of old she used to roveDelighted in the city grove,Thus, even thus she joys to treadThe woodlands uninhabited.Like a young child, her face as fairAs the young moon, she wanders there.What though in lonely woods she strayStill Ráma is her joy and stay:All his the heart no sorrow bends,Her very life on him depends.For, if her lord she might not see,Ayodhyá like the wood would be.She bids him, as she roams, declareThe names of towns and hamlets there,Marks various trees that meet her eye,And many a brook that hurries by,And Janak daughter seems to roamOne little league away from homeWhen Ráma or his brother speaksAnd gives the answer that she seeks.This, Lady, I remember well,Nor angry words have I to tell:Reproaches at Kaikeyí shot,Such, Queen, my mind remembers not.\"The speech when Sítá wrath was high,Sumantra passed in silence by,That so his pleasant words might cheerWith sweet report Kausalyá ear.\"Her moonlike beauty suffers notThough winds be rude and suns be hot:The way, the danger, and the toilHer gentle lustre may not soil.Like the red lily leafy crownOr as the fair full moon looks down,So the Videhan lady faceStill shines with undiminished grace.What if the borrowed colours throwO\\'er her fine feet no rosy glow,Still with their natural tints they spreadA lotus glory where they tread.In sportive grace she walks the groundAnd sweet her chiming anklets sound.No jewels clasp the faultless limb:She leaves them all for love of him.If in the woods her gentle eyeA lion sees, or tiger nigh,Or elephant, she fears no illFor Ráma arm supports her still.No longer be their fate deplored,Nor thine, nor that of Kosal lord,For conduct such as theirs shall buyWide glory that can never die.For casting grief and care away,Delighting in the forest, theyWith joyful spirits, blithe and gay,Set forward on the ancient wayWhere mighty saints have led:Their highest aim, their dearest careTo keep their father honour fair,Observing still the oath he sware,They roam, on wild fruit fed.\"Thus with persuasive art he triedTo turn her from her grief aside,By soothing fancies won.But still she gave her sorrow vent:\"Ah Ráma,\" was her shrill lament,\"My love, my son, my son!\"Canto LXI. Kausalyá Lament.When, best of all who give delight,Her Ráma wandered far from sight,Kausalyá weeping, sore distressed,The king her husband thus addressed:\"Thy name, O Monarch, far and wideThrough the three worlds is glorified:Yet Ráma is the pitying mind,His speed is true, his heart is kind.How will thy sons, good lord, sustainWith Sítá, all their care and pain?How in the wild endure distress,Nursed in the lap of tenderness?How will the dear Videhan bearThe heat and cold when wandering thereBred in the bliss of princely state,So young and fair and delicate?The large-eyed lady, wont to eatThe best of finely seasoned meat--How will she now her life sustainWith woodland fare of self-sown grain?Will she, with joys encompassed long,Who loved the music and the song,In the wild wood endure to hearThe ravening lion voice of fear?Where sleeps my strong-armed hero, where,Like Lord Mahendra standard, fair?Where is, by Lakshman side, his bed,His club-like arm beneath his head?When shall I see his flower-like eyes,And face that with the lotus vies,Feel his sweet lily breath, and viewHis glorious hair and lotus hue?The heart within my breast, I feel,Is adamant or hardest steel,Or, in a thousand fragments split,The loss of him had shattered it,When those I love, who should be blest,Are wandering in the wood distressed,Condemned their wretched lives to leadIn exile, by thy ruthless deed.If, when the fourteen years are past,Ráma reseeks his home at last,I think not Bharat will consentTo yield the wealth and government.At funeral feasts some mourners dealTo kith and kin the solemn meal,And having duly fed them allSome Bráhmans to the banquet call.The best of Bráhmans, good and wise,The tardy summoning despise,And, equal to the Gods, disdainCups, e\\'en of Amrit, thus to drain.Nay e\\'en when Bráhmans first have fed,They loathe the meal for others spread,And from the leavings turn with scorn,As bulls avoid a fractured horn.So Ráma, sovereign lord of men,Will spurn the sullied kingship then:He born the eldest and the best,His younger leavings will detest,Turning from tasted food away,As tigers scorn another prey.The sacred post is used not twice,Nor elements, in sacrifice.But once the sacred grass is spread,But once with oil the flame is fed:So Ráma pride will ne\\'er receiveThe royal power which others leave,Like wine when tasteless dregs are left,Or rites of Soma juice bereft.Be sure the pride of Raghu raceWill never stoop to such disgrace:The lordly lion will not bearThat man should beard him in his lair.Were all the worlds against him rangedHis dauntless soul were still unchanged:He, dutiful, in duty strong,Would purge the impious world from wrong.Could not the hero, brave and bold,The archer, with his shafts of gold,Burn up the very seas, as doomWill in the end all life consume?Of lion might, eyed like a bull,A prince so brave and beautiful,Thou hast with wicked hate pursued,Like sea-born tribes who eat their brood.If thou, O Monarch, hadst but knownThe duty all the Twice-born own,If the good laws had touched thy mind,Which sages in the Scriptures find,Thou ne\\'er hadst driven forth to pineThis brave, this duteous son of thine.First on her lord the wife depends,Next on her son and last on friends:These three supports in life has she,And not a fourth for her may be.Thy heart, O King, I have not won;In wild woods roams my banished son;Far are my friends: ah, hapless me,Quite ruined and destroyed by thee.\"Canto LXII. Dasaratha Consoled.The queen stern speech the monarch heard,As rage and grief her bosom stirred,And by his anguish sore oppressedReflected in his secret breast.Fainting and sad, with woe distraught,He wandered in a maze of thought;At length the queller of the foeGrew conscious, rallying from his woe.When consciousness returned anewLong burning sighs the monarch drew,Again immersed in thought he eyedKausalyá standing by his side.Back to his pondering soul was broughtThe direful deed his hand had wrought,When, guiltless of the wrong intent,His arrow at a sound was sent.Distracted by his memory sting,And mourning for his son, the kingTo two consuming griefs a prey,A miserable victim lay.The double woe devoured him fast,As on the ground his eyes he cast,Joined suppliant hands, her heart to touch,And spake in the answer, trembling much:\"Kausalyá, for thy grace I sue,Joining these hands as suppliants do.Thou e\\'en to foes hast ever beenA gentle, good, and loving queen.Her lord, with noble virtues graced,Her lord, by lack of all debased,Is still a God in woman eyes,If duty law she hold and prize.Thou, who the right hast aye pursued,Life changes and its chances viewed,Shouldst never launch, though sorrow-stirred,At me distressed, one bitter word.\"She listened, as with sorrow faintHe murmured forth his sad complaint:Her brimming eyes with tears ran o\\'er,As spouts the new fallen water pour;His suppliant hands, with fear dismayedShe gently clasped in hers, and laid,Like a fair lotus, on her head,And faltering in her trouble said:\"Forgive me; at thy feet I lie,With low bent head to thee I cry.By thee besought, thy guilty damePardon from thee can scarcely claim.She merits not the name of wifeWho cherishes perpetual strifeWith her own husband good and wise,Her lord both here and in the skies.I know the claims of duty well,I know thy lips the truth must tell.All the wild words I rashly spoke,Forth from my heart, through anguish, broke;For sorrow bends the stoutest soul,And cancels Scripture high control.Yea, sorrow might all else o\\'erthrowsThe strongest and the worst of foes.\\'Tis thus with all: we keenly feel,Yet bear the blows our foemen deal,But when a slender woe assailsThe manliest spirit bends and quails.The fifth long night has now begunSince the wild woods have lodged my son:To me whose joy is drowned in tears,Each day a dreary year appears.While all my thoughts on him are setGrief at my heart swells wilder yet:With doubled might thus Ocean ravesWhen rushing floods increase his waves.\"As from Kausalyá reasoning wellThe gentle words of wisdom fell,The sun went down with dying flame,And darkness o\\'er the landscape came.His lady soothing words in partRelieved the monarch aching heart,Who, wearied out by all his woes,Yielded to sleep and took repose.Canto LXIII. The Hermit Son.But soon by rankling grief oppressedThe king awoke from troubled rest,And his sad heart was tried againWith anxious thought where all was pain.Ráma and Lakshman mournful fateOn Dasaratha, good and greatAs Indra, pressed with crushing weight,As when the demon might assailsThe Sun-God, and his glory pales.Ere yet the sixth long night was spent,Since Ráma to the woods was sent,The king at midnight sadly thoughtOf the old crime his hand had wrought,And thus to Queen Kausalyá criedWho still for Ráma moaned and sighed:\"If thou art waking, give, I pray,Attention to the words I say.Whate\\'er the conduct men pursue,Be good or ill the acts they do,Be sure, dear Queen, they find the meedOf wicked or of virtuous deed.A heedless child we call the manWhose feeble judgment fails to scanThe weight of what his hands may do,Its lightness, fault, and merit too.One lays the Mango garden low,And bids the gay Palásas grow:Longing for fruit their bloom he sees,But grieves when fruit should bend the trees.Cut by my hand, my fruit-trees fell,Palása trees I watered well.My hopes this foolish heart deceive,And for my banished son I grieve.Kausalyá, in my youthful primeArmed with my bow I wrought the crime,Proud of my skill, my name renowned,An archer prince who shoots by sound.The deed this hand unwitting wroughtThis misery on my soul has brought,As children seize the deadly cupAnd blindly drink the poison up.As the unreasoning man may beCharmed with the gay Palása tree,I unaware have reaped the fruitOf joying at a sound to shoot.As regent prince I shared the throne,Thou wast a maid to me unknown,The early Rain-time duly came,And strengthened love delicious flame.The sun had drained the earth that layAll glowing \\'neath the summer day,And to the gloomy clime had fledWhere dwell the spirits of the dead.(335)The fervent heat that moment ceased,The darkening clouds each hour increasedAnd frogs and deer and peacocks allRejoiced to see the torrents fall.Their bright wings heavy from the shower,The birds, new-bathed, had scarce the powerTo reach the branches of the treesWhose high tops swayed beneath the breeze.The fallen rain, and falling still,Hung like a sheet on every hill,Till, with glad deer, each flooded steepShowed glorious as the mighty deep.The torrents down its wooded sidePoured, some unstained, while others dyedGold, ashy, silver, ochre, boreThe tints of every mountain ore.In that sweet time, when all are pleased,My arrows and my bow I seized;Keen for the chase, in field or grove,Down Sarjú bank my car I drove.I longed with all my lawless willSome elephant by night to kill,Some buffalo that came to drink,Or tiger, at the river brink.When all around was dark and still,I heard a pitcher slowly fill,And thought, obscured in deepest shade,An elephant the sound had made.I drew a shaft that glittered bright,Fell as a serpent venomed bite;I longed to lay the monster dead,And to the mark my arrow sped.Then in the calm of morning, clearA hermit wailing smote my ear:\"Ah me, ah me,\" he cried, and sank,Pierced by my arrow, on the bank.E\\'en as the weapon smote his side,I heard a human voice that cried:\"Why lights this shaft on one like me,A poor and harmless devotee?I came by night to fill my jarFrom this lone stream where no men are.Ah, who this deadly shaft has shot?Whom have I wronged, and knew it not?Why should a boy so harmless feelThe vengeance of the winged steel?Or who should slay the guiltless sonOf hermit sire who injures none,Who dwells retired in woods, and thereSupports his life on woodland fare?Ah me, ah me, why am I slain,What booty will the murderer gain?In hermit coils I bind my hair,Coats made of skin and bark I wear.Ah, who the cruel deed can praiseWhose idle toil no fruit repays,As impious as the wretch crimeWho dares his master bed to climb?Nor does my parting spirit grieveBut for the life which thus I leave:Alas, my mother and my sire,--I mourn for them when I expire.Ah me, that aged, helpless pair,Long cherished by my watchful care,How will it be with them this dayWhen to the Five(336) I pass away?Pierced by the self-same dart we die,Mine aged mother, sire, and I.Whose mighty hand, whose lawless mindHas all the three to death consigned?\"When I, by love of duty stirred,That touching lamentation heard,Pierced to the heart by sudden woe,I threw to earth my shafts and bow.My heart was full of grief and dreadAs swiftly to the place I sped,Where, by my arrow wounded sore,A hermit lay on Sarjú shore.His matted hair was all unbound,His pitcher empty on the ground,And by the fatal arrow pained,He lay with dust and gore distained.I stood confounded and amazed:His dying eyes to mine he raised,And spoke this speech in accents stern,As though his light my soul would burn:\"How have I wronged thee, King, that IStruck by thy mortal arrow die?The wood my home, this jar I brought,And water for my parents sought.This one keen shaft that strikes me throughSlays sire and aged mother too.Feeble and blind, in helpless pain,They wait for me and thirst in vain.They with parched lips their pangs must bear,And hope will end in blank despair.Ah me, there seems no fruit in storeFor holy zeal or Scripture lore,Or else ere now my sire would knowThat his dear son is lying low.Yet, if my mournful fate he knew,What could his arm so feeble do?The tree, firm-rooted, ne\\'er may beThe guardian of a stricken tree.Haste to my father, and relateWhile time allows, my sudden fate,Lest he consume thee as the fireBurns up the forest, in his ire.This little path, O King, pursue:My father cot thou soon wilt view.There sue for pardon to the sage,Lest he should curse thee in his rage.First from the wound extract the dartThat kills me with its deadly smart,E\\'en as the flushed impetuous tideEats through the river yielding side.\"I feared to draw the arrow out,And pondered thus in painful doubt:\"Now tortured by the shaft he lies,But if I draw it forth he dies.\"Helpless I stood, faint, sorely grieved:The hermit son my thought perceived;As one o\\'ercome by direst painHe scarce had strength to speak again.With writhing limb and struggling breath,Nearer and ever nearer death\"My senses undisturbed remain,And fortitude has conquered pain:Now from one tear thy soul be freed.Thy hand has made a Bráhman bleed.Let not this pang thy bosom wring:No twice-born youth am I, O King,For of a Vaisya sire I came,Who wedded with a Súdra dame.\"These words the boy could scarcely say,As tortured by the shaft he lay,Twisting his helpless body round,Then trembling senseless on the ground.Then from his bleeding side I drewThe rankling shaft that pierced him through.With death last fear my face he eyed,And, rich in store of penance, died.\"Canto LXIV. Dasaratha Death.The son of Raghu to his queenThus far described the unequalled scene,And, as the hermit death he rued,The mournful story thus renewed:\"The deed my heedless hand had wroughtPerplexed me with remorseful thought,And all alone I pondered stillHow kindly deed might salve the ill.The pitcher from the ground I took,And filled it from that fairest brook,Then, by the path the hermit showed,I reached his sainted sire abode.I came, I saw: the aged pair,Feeble and blind, were sitting there,Like birds with clipped wings, side by side,With none their helpless steps to guide.Their idle hours the twain beguiledWith talk of their returning child,And still the cheering hope enjoyed,The hope, alas, by me destroyed.Then spoke the sage, as drawing nearThe sound of footsteps reached his ear:\"Dear son, the water quickly bring;Why hast thou made this tarrying?Thy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,And bathing in the brook delayed.She weeps because thou camest not;Haste, O my son, within the cot.If she or I have ever doneA thing to pain thee, dearest son,Dismiss the memory from thy mind:A hermit thou, be good and kind.On thee our lives, our all, depend:Thou art thy friendless parents\\' friend.The eyeless couple eye art thou:Then why so cold and silent now?\"With sobbing voice and bosom wrungI scarce could move my faltering tongue,And with my spirit filled with dreadI looked upon the sage, and said,While mind, and sense, and nerve I strungTo fortify my trembling tongue,And let the aged hermit knowHis son sad fate, my fear and woe:\"High-minded Saint, not I thy child,A warrior, Dasaratha styled.I bear a grievous sorrow weightBorn of a deed which good men hate.My lord, I came to Sarjú shore,And in my hand my bow I boreFor elephant or beast of chaseThat seeks by night his drinking place.There from the stream a sound I heardAs if a jar the water stirred.An elephant, I thought, was nigh:I aimed, and let an arrow fly.Swift to the place I made my way,And there a wounded hermit layGasping for breath: the deadly dartStood quivering in his youthful heart.I hastened near with pain oppressed;He faltered out his last behest.And quickly, as he bade me do,From his pierced side the shaft I drew.I drew the arrow from the rent,And up to heaven the hermit went,Lamenting, as from earth he passed,His aged parents to the last.Thus, unaware, the deed was done:My hand, unwitting, killed thy son.For what remains, O, let me winThy pardon for my heedless sin.\"As the sad tale of sin I toldThe hermit grief was uncontrolled.With flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,Thus spake the venerable saint:I stood with hand to hand applied,And listened as he spoke and sighed:\"If thou, O King, hadst left unsaidBy thine own tongue this tale of dread,Thy head for hideous guilt accursedHad in a thousand pieces burst.A hermit blood by warrior spilt,In such a case, with purposed guilt,Down from his high estate would bringEven the thunder mighty King.And he a dart who conscious sendsAgainst the devotee who spendsHis pure life by the law of Heaven--That sinner head will split in seven.Thou livest, for thy heedless handHas wrought a deed thou hast not planned,Else thou and all of Raghu lineHad perished by this act of thine.Now guide us,\" thus the hermit said,\"Forth to the spot where he lies dead.Guide us, this day, O Monarch, weFor the last time our son would see:The hermit dress of skin he woreRent from his limbs distained with gore;His senseless body lying slain,His soul in Yama dark domain.\"Alone the mourning pair I led,Their souls with woe disquieted,And let the dame and hermit layTheir hands upon the breathless clay.The father touched his son, and pressedThe body to his aged breast;Then falling by the dead boy side,He lifted up his voice, and cried:\"Hast thou no word, my child, to say?No greeting for thy sire to-day?Why art thou angry, darling? whyWilt thou upon the cold earth lie?If thou, my son, art wroth with me,Here, duteous child, thy mother see.What! no embrace for me, my son?No word of tender love--not one?Whose gentle voice, so soft and clear,Soothing my spirit, shall I hearWhen evening comes, with accents sweetScripture or ancient lore repeat?Who, having fed the sacred fire,And duly bathed, as texts require,Will cheer, when evening rites are done,The father mourning for his son?Who will the daily meal provideFor the poor wretch who lacks a guide,Feeding the helpless with the bestBerries and roots, like some dear guest?How can these hands subsistence findFor thy poor mother, old and blind?The wretched votaress how sustain,Who mourns her child in ceaseless pain?Stay yet a while, my darling, stay,Nor fly to Yama realm to-day.To-morrow I thy sire and sheWho bare thee, child, will go with, thee.(337)Then when I look on Yama, ITo great Vivasvat son will cry:\"Hear, King of justice, and restoreOur child to feed us, I implore.Lord of the world, of mighty fame,Faithful and just, admit my claim,And grant this single boon to freeMy soul from fear, to one like me.\"Because, my son, untouched by stain,By sinful hands thou fallest slain,Win, through thy truth, the sphere where thoseWho die by hostile darts repose.Seek the blest home prepared for allThe valiant who in battle fall,Who face the foe and scorn to yield,In glory dying on the field.Rise to the heaven where DhundhumárAnd Nahush, mighty heroes, are,Where Janamejay and the blestDilípa, Sagar, Saivya, rest:Home of all virtuous spirits, earnedBy fervent rites and Scripture learned:By those whose sacred fires have glowed,Whose liberal hands have fields bestowed:By givers of a thousand cows,By lovers of one faithful spouse:By those who serve their masters well,And cast away this earthly shell.None of my race can ever knowThe bitter pain of lasting woe.But doomed to that dire fate is heWhose guilty hand has slaughtered thee.\"Thus with wild tears the aged saintMade many a time his piteous plaint,Then with his wife began to shedThe funeral water for the dead.But in a shape celestial clad,Won by the merits of the lad,The spirit from the body brakeAnd to the mourning parents spake:\"A glorious home in realms aboveRewards my care and filial love.You, honoured parents, soon shall bePartakers of that home with me.\"He spake, and swiftly mounting high,With Indra near him, to the skyOn a bright car, with flame that glowed,Sublime the duteous hermit rode.The father, with his consort aid,The funeral rites with water paid,And thus his speech to me renewedWho stood in suppliant attitude:\"Slay me this day, O, slay me, King,For death no longer has a sting.Childless am I: thy dart has doneTo death my dear, my only son.Because the boy I loved so wellSlain by thy heedless arrow fell,My curse upon thy soul shall pressWith bitter woe and heaviness.I mourn a slaughtered child, and thouShalt feel the pangs that kill me now.Bereft and suffering e\\'en as I,So shalt thou mourn thy son, and die.Thy hand unwitting dealt the blowThat laid a holy hermit low,And distant, therefore, is the timeWhen thou shalt suffer for the crime.The hour shall come when, crushed by woesLike these I feel, thy life shall close:A debt to pay in after daysLike his the priestly fee who pays.\"This curse on me the hermit laid,Nor yet his tears and groans were stayed.Then on the pyre their bodies castThe pair; and straight to heaven they passed.As in sad thought I pondered longBack to my memory came the wrongDone in wild youth, O lady dear,When \\'twas my boast to shoot by ear.The deed has borne the fruit, which nowHangs ripe upon the bending bough:Thus dainty meats the palate please,And lure the weak to swift disease.Now on my soul return with dreadThe words that noble hermit said,That I for a dear son should grieve,And of the woe my life should leave.\"Thus spake the king with many a tear;Then to his wife he cried in fear:\"I cannot see thee, love; but layThy gentle hand in mine, I pray.Ah me, if Ráma touched me thus,If once, returning home to us,He bade me wealth and lordship give,Then, so I think, my soul would live.Unlike myself, unjust and meanHave been my ways with him, my Queen,But like himself is all that he,My noble son, has done to me.His son, though far from right he stray,What prudent sire would cast away?What banished son would check his ire,Nor speak reproaches of his sire?I see thee not: these eyes grow blind,And memory quits my troubled mind.Angels of Death are round me: theySummon my soul with speed away.What woe more grievous can there be,That, when from light and life I flee,I may not, ere I part, beholdMy virtuous Ráma, true and bold?Grief for my son, the brave and true,Whose joy it was my will to do,Dries up my breath, as summer driesThe last drop in the pool that lies.Not men, but blessed Gods, are theyWhose eyes shall see his face that day;See him, when fourteen years are past,With earrings decked return at last.My fainting mind forgets to think:Low and more low my spirits sink.Each from its seat, my senses steal:I cannot hear, or taste, or feel.This lethargy of soul o\\'ercomesEach organ, and its function numbs:So when the oil begins to fail,The torch rays grow faint and pale.This flood of woe caused by this handDestroys me helpless and unmanned,Resistless as the floods that boreA passage through the river shore.Ah Raghu son, ah mighty-armed,By whom my cares were soothed and charmed,My son in whom I took delight,Now vanished from thy father sight!Kausalyá, ah, I cannot see;Sumitrá, gentle devotee!Alas, Kaikeyí, cruel dame,My bitter foe, thy father shame!\"Kausalyá and Sumitrá keptTheir watch beside him as he wept.And Dasaratha moaned and sighed,And grieving for his darling died.Canto LXV. The Women Lament.And now the night had past away,And brightly dawned another day;The minstrels, trained to play and sing,Flocked to the chamber of the king:Bards, who their gayest raiment wore,And heralds famed for ancient lore:And singers, with their songs of praise,Made music in their several ways.There as they poured their blessings choiceAnd hailed their king with hand and voice,Their praises with a swelling roarEchoed through court and corridor.Then as the bards his glory sang,From beaten palms loud answer rang,As glad applauders clapped their hands,And told his deeds in distant lands.The swelling concert woke a throngOf sleeping birds to life and song:Some in the branches of the trees,Some caged in halls and galleries.Nor was the soft string music mute;The gentle whisper of the lute,And blessings sung by singers skilledThe palace of the monarch filled.Eunuchs and dames of life unstained,Each in the arts of waiting trained,Drew near attentive as before,And crowded to the chamber door:These skilful when and how to shedThe lustral stream o\\'er limb and head,Others with golden ewers stoodOf water stained with sandal wood.And many a maid, pure, young, and fair,Her load of early offerings bare,Cups of the flood which all revere,And sacred things, and toilet gear.Each several thing was duly broughtAs rule of old observance taught,And lucky signs on each impressedStamped it the fairest and the best.There anxious, in their long array,All waited till the shine of day:But when the king nor rose nor spoke,Doubt and alarm within them woke.Forthwith the dames, by duty led,Attendants on the monarch bed,Within the royal chamber pressedTo wake their master from his rest.Skilled in the lore of dreaming, theyFirst touched the bed on which he lay.But none replied; no sound was heard,Nor hand, nor head, nor body stirred.They trembled, and their dread increased,Fearing his breath of life had ceased,And bending low their heads, they shookLike the tall reeds that fringe the brook.In doubt and terror down they knelt,Looked on his face, his cold hand felt,And then the gloomy truth appearedOf all their hearts had darkly feared.Kausalyá and Sumitrá, wornWith weeping for their sons, forlorn,Woke not, but lay in slumber deepAnd still as death unending sleep.Bowed down by grief, her colour fled,Her wonted lustre dull and dead,Kausalyá shone not, like a starObscured behind a cloudy bar.Beside the king her couch was spread,And next was Queen Sumitrá bed,Who shone no more with beauty glow,Her face bedewed with tears of woe.There lapped in sleep each wearied queen,There as in sleep, the king was seen;And swift the troubling thought came o\\'erTheir spirits that he breathed no more.At once with wailing loud and highThe matrons shrieked a bitter cry,As widowed elephants bewailTheir dead lord in the woody vale.At the loud shriek that round them rang,Kausalyá and Sumitrá sprangAwakened from their beds, with eyesWide open in their first surprise.Quick to the monarch side they came,And saw and touched his lifeless frame;One cry, O husband! forth they sent,And prostrate to the ground they went.The king of Kosal daughter(338) thereWrithed, with the dust on limb and hairLustreless, as a star might lieHurled downward from the glorious sky.When the king voice in death was stilled,The women who the chamber filledSaw, like a widow elephant slain,Kausalyá prostrate in her pain.Then all the monarch ladies ledBy Queen Kaikeyí at their head,Poured forth their tears, and weeping so,Sank on the ground, consumed by woe.The cry of grief so long and loudWent up from all the royal crowd,That, doubled by the matron train,It made the palace ring again.Filled with dark fear and eager eyes,Anxiety and wild surmise;Echoing with the cries of griefOf sorrowing friends who mourned their chief,Dejected, pale with deep distress,Hurled from their height of happiness:Such was the look the palace woreWhere lay the king who breathed no more.Canto LXVI. The Embalming.Kausalyá eyes with tears o\\'erflowed,Weighed down by varied sorrows\\' load;On her dead lord her gaze she bent,Who lay like fire whose might is spent,Like the great deep with waters dry,Or like the clouded sun on high.Then on her lap she laid his head.And on Kaikeyí looked and said:\"Triumphant now enjoy thy reignWithout a thorn thy side to pain.Thou hast pursued thy single aim,And killed the king, O wicked dame.Far from my sight my Ráma flies,My perished lord has sought the skies.No friend, no hope my life to cheer,I cannot tread the dark path here.Who would forsake her husband, whoThat God to whom her love is due,And wish to live one hour, but sheWhose heart no duty owns, like thee?The ravenous sees no fault: his greedWill e\\'en on poison blindly feed.Kaikeyí, through a hump-back maid,This royal house in death has laid.King Janak, with his queen, will hearHeart rent like me the tidings drearOf Ráma banished by the king,Urged by her impious counselling.No son has he, his age is great,And sinking with the double weight,He for his darling child will pine,And pierced with woe his life resign.Sprung from Videha monarch, sheA sad and lovely devotee,Roaming the wood, unmeet for woe,Will toil and trouble undergo.She in the gloomy night with fearThe cries of beast and bird will hear,And trembling in her wild alarmWill cling to Ráma sheltering arm.Ah, little knows my duteous sonThat I am widowed and undone--My Ráma of the lotus eye,Gone hence, gone hence, alas, to die.Now, as a living wife and true,I, e\\'en this day, will perish too:Around his form these arms will throwAnd to the fire with him will go.\"Clasping her husband lifeless clayA while the weeping votaress lay,Till chamberlains removed her thenceO\\'ercome by sorrow violence.Then in a cask of oil they laidHim who in life the world had swayed,And finished, as the lords desired,All rites for parted souls required.The lords, all-wise, refused to burnThe monarch ere his son return;So for a while the corpse they setEmbalmed in oil, and waited yet.The women heard: no doubt remained,And wildly for the king they plained.With gushing tears that drowned each eyeWildly they waved their arms on high,And each her mangling nails impressedDeep in her head and knee and breast:\"Of Ráma reft,--who ever spakeThe sweetest words the heart to take,Who firmly to the truth would cling,--Why dost thou leave us, mighty King?How can the consorts thou hast leftWidowed, of Raghu son bereft,Live with our foe Kaikeyí near,The wicked queen we hate and fear?She threw away the king, her spiteDrove Ráma forth and Lakshman might,And gentle Sítá: how will sheSpare any, whosoe\\'er it be?\"Oppressed with sorrow, tear-distained,The royal women thus complained.Like night when not a star appears,Like a sad widow drowned in tears,Ayodhyá city, dark and dim,Reft of her lord was sad for him.When thus for woe the king to heaven had fled,And still on earth his lovely wives remained.With dying light the sun to rest had sped,And night triumphant o\\'er the landscape reigned.Canto LXVII. The Praise Of Kings.That night of sorrow passed away,And rose again the God of Day.Then all the twice-born peers of stateTogether met for high debate.Jáválí, lord of mighty fame.And Gautam, and Kátyáyan came,And Márkandeya reverend age,And Vámadeva, glorious sage:Sprung from Mudgalya seed the one,The other ancient Kasyap son.With lesser lords these Bráhmans eachSpoke in his turn his several speech,And turning to Vasishtha, bestOf household priests him thus addressed:\"The night of bitter woe has past,Which seemed a hundred years to last,Our king, in sorrow for his son,Reunion with the Five has won.His soul is where the blessed are,While Ráma roams in woods afar,And Lakshman, bright in glorious deeds,Goes where his well-loved brother leads.And Bharat and Satrughna, theyWho smite their foes in battle fray,Far in the realm of Kekaya stay,Where their maternal grandsire careKeeps Rájagriha city fair.Let one of old Ikshváku raceObtain this day the sovereign place,Or havoc and destruction straightOur kingless land will devastate.In kingless lands no thunder voice,No lightning wreaths the heart rejoice,Nor does Parjanya heavenly rainDescend upon the burning plain.Where none is king, the sower handCasts not the seed upon the land;The son against the father strives.And husbands fail to rule their wives.In kingless realms no princes callTheir friends to meet in crowded hall;No joyful citizens resortTo garden trim or sacred court.In kingless realms no Twice-born careTo sacrifice with text and prayer,Nor Bráhmans, who their vows maintain,The great solemnities ordain.The joys of happier days have ceased:No gathering, festival, or feastTogether calls the merry throngDelighted with the play and song.In kingless lands it ne\\'er is wellWith sons of trade who buy and sell:No men who pleasant tales repeatDelight the crowd with stories sweet.In kingless realms we ne\\'er beholdYoung maidens decked with gems and gold,Flock to the gardens blithe and gayTo spend their evening hours in play.No lover in the flying carRides with his love to woods afar.In kingless lands no wealthy swainWho keeps the herd and reaps the grain,Lies sleeping, blest with ample store,Securely near his open door.Upon the royal roads we seeNo tusked elephant roaming free,Of three-score years, whose head and neckSweet tinkling bells of silver deck.We hear no more the glad applauseWhen his strong bow each rival draws,No clap of hands, no eager criesThat cheer each martial exercise.In kingless realms no merchant bandsWho travel forth to distant lands,With precious wares their wagons load,And fear no danger on the road.No sage secure in self-control,Brooding on God with mind and soul,In lonely wanderings finds his homeWhere\\'er at eve his feet may roam.In kingless realms no man is sureHe holds his life and wealth secure.In kingless lands no warriors smiteThe foeman host in glorious fight.In kingless lands the wise no more,Well trained in Scripture holy lore,In shady groves and gardens meetTo argue in their calm retreat.No longer, in religious fear,Do they who pious vows revere,Bring dainty cates and wreaths of flowersAs offerings to the heavenly powers.No longer, bright as trees in spring,Shine forth the children of the kingResplendent in the people eyesWith aloe wood and sandal dyes.A brook where water once has been,A grove where grass no more is green,Kine with no herdsman guiding hand--So wretched is a kingless land.The car its waving banner rears,Banner of fire the smoke appears:Our king, the banner of our pride,A God with Gods is glorified.In kingless lands no law is known,And none may call his wealth his own,Each preys on each from hour to hour,As fish the weaker fish devour.Then fearless, atheists overleapThe bounds of right the godly keep,And when no royal powers restrain,Preëminence and lordship gain.As in the frame of man the eyeKeeps watch and ward, a careful spy,The monarch in his wide domainsProtects the truth, the right maintains.He is the right, the truth is he,Their hopes in him the well-born see.On him his people lives depend,Mother is he, and sire, and friend.The world were veiled in blinding night,And none could see or know aright,Ruled there no king in any stateThe good and ill to separate.We will obey thy word and willAs if our king were living still:As keeps his bounds the faithful sea,So we observe thy high decree.O best of Bráhmans, first in place,Our kingless land lies desolate:Some scion of Ikshváku raceDo thou as monarch consecrate.\"Canto LXVIII. The Envoys.Vasishtha heard their speech and prayer,And thus addressed the concourse there,Friends, Bráhmans, counsellors, and allAssembled in the palace hall:\"Ye know that Bharat, free from care,Still lives in Rájagriha(339) whereThe father of his mother reigns:Satrughna by his side remains.Let active envoys, good at need,Thither on fleetest horses speed,To bring the hero youths away:Why waste the time in dull delay?\"Quick came from all the glad reply:\"Vasishtha, let the envoys fly!\"He heard their speech, and thus renewedHis charge before the multitude:\"Nandan, Asok, Siddhárth, attend,Your ears, Jayanta, Vijay, lend:Be yours, what need requires, to do:I speak these words to all of you.With coursers of the fleetest breedTo Rájagriha city speed.Then rid your bosoms of distress,And Bharat thus from me address:\"The household priest and peers by usSend health to thee and greet thee thus:Come to thy father home with haste:Thine absent time no longer waste.\"But speak no word of Ráma fled,Tell not the prince his sire is dead,Nor to the royal youth the fateThat ruins Raghu race relate.Go quickly hence, and with you bearFine silken vestures rich and rare,And gems and many a precious thingAs gifts to Bharat and the king.\"With ample stores of food supplied,Each to his home the envoys hied,Prepared, with steeds of swiftest race,To Kekaya land(340) their way to trace.They made all due provision there,And every need arranged with care,Then ordered by Vasishtha, theyWent forth with speed upon their way.Then northward of Pralamba, westOf Apartála, on they pressed,Crossing the Máliní that flowedWith gentle stream athwart the road.They traversed Gangá holy wavesWhere she Hástinapura(341) laves,Thence to Panchála(342) westward fastThrough Kurujángal land(343) they passed.On, on their course the envoys heldBy urgency of task impelled.Quick glancing at each lucid floodAnd sweet lake gay with flower and bud.Beyond, they passed unwearied o\\'er,Where glad birds fill the flood and shoreOf Saradandá racing fleetWith heavenly water clear and sweet,Thereby a tree celestial growsWhich every boon on prayer bestows:To its blest shade they humbly bent,Then to Kulingá town they went.Then, having passed the Warrior Wood,In Abhikála next they stood,O\\'er sacred Ikshumatí(344) came,Their ancient kings\\' ancestral claim.They saw the learned Bráhmans stand,Each drinking from his hollowed hand,And through Báhíka(345) journeying stillThey reached at length Sudáman hill:There Vishnu footstep turned to see,Vipásá(346) viewed, and Sálmalí,And many a lake and river met,Tank, pool, and pond, and rivulet.And lions saw, and tigers near,And elephants and herds of deer,And still, by prompt obedience led,Along the ample road they sped.Then when their course so swift and long,Had worn their steeds though fleet and strong,To Girivraja splendid townThey came by night, and lighted down.To please their master, and to guardThe royal race, the lineal right,The envoys, spent with riding hard,To that fair city came by night.(347)Canto LXIX. Bharat Dream.The night those messengers of stateHad past within the city gate,In dreams the slumbering Bharat sawA sight that chilled his soul with awe.The dream that dire events foretoldLeft Bharat heart with horror cold,And with consuming woes distraught,Upon his aged sire he thought.His dear companions, swift to traceThe signs of anguish on his face,Drew near, his sorrow to expel,And pleasant tales began to tell.Some woke sweet music cheering sound,And others danced in lively round.With joke and jest they strove to raiseHis spirits, quoting ancient plays;But Bharat still, the lofty-souled,Deaf to sweet tales his fellows told,Unmoved by music, dance, and jest,Sat silent, by his woe oppressed.To him, begirt by comrades near,Thus spoke the friend he held most dear:\"Why ringed around by friends, art thouSo silent and so mournful now?\"\"Hear thou,\" thus Bharat made reply,\"What chills my heart and dims mine eye.I dreamt I saw the king my sireSink headlong in a lake of mireDown from a mountain high in air,His body soiled, and loose his hair.Upon the miry lake he seemedTo lie and welter, as I dreamed;With hollowed hands full many a draughtOf oil he took, and loudly laughed.With head cast down I saw him makeA meal on sesamum and cake;The oil from every member dripped,And in its clammy flood he dipped.The ocean bed was bare and dry,The moon had fallen from the sky,And all the world lay still and dead,With whelming darkness overspread.The earth was rent and opened wide,The leafy trees were scorched, and died;I saw the seated mountains split,And wreaths of rising smoke emit.The stately beast the monarch rodeHis long tusks rent and splintered showed;And flames that quenched and cold had lainBlazed forth with kindled light again.I looked, and many a handsome dame,Arrayed in brown and sable cameAnd bore about the monarch, dressed,On iron stool, in sable vest.And then the king, of virtuous mind,A blood-red wreath around him twined,Forth on an ass-drawn chariot sped,As southward still he bent his head.Then, crimson-clad, a dame appearedWho at the monarch laughed and jeered;And a she-monster, dire to view,Her hand upon his body threw.Such is the dream I dreamt by night,Which chills me yet with wild affright:Either the king or Ráma, IOr Lakshman now must surely die.For when an ass-drawn chariot seemsTo bear away a man in dreams,Be sure above his funeral pyreThe smoke soon rears its cloudy spire.This makes my spirit low and weak,My tongue is slow and loth to speak:My lips and throat are dry for dread,And all my soul disquieted.My lips, relaxed, can hardly speak,And chilling dread has changed my cheekI blame myself in aimless fears,And still no cause of blame appears.I dwell upon this dream of illWhose changing scenes I viewed,And on the startling horror stillMy troubled thoughts will brood.Still to my soul these terrors cling,Reluctant to depart,And the strange vision of the kingStill weighs upon my heart.\"Canto LXX. Bharat Departure.While thus he spoke, the envoys borneOn horses faint and travel-wornHad gained the city fenced aroundWith a deep moat protecting bound.An audience of the king they gained,And honours from the prince obtained;The monarch feet they humbly pressed,To Bharat next these words addressed:\"The household priest and peers by usSend health to thee and greet thee thus:\"Come to thy father house with haste:Thine absent time no longer waste.\"Receive these vestures rich and rare,These costly gems and jewels fair,And to thy uncle here presentEach precious robe and ornament.These for the king and him suffice--Two hundred millions is their price--These, worth a hundred millions, beReserved, O large-eyed Prince, for thee.\"Loving his friends with heart and soul,The joyful prince received the whole,Due honour to the envoys paid,And thus in turn his answer made:\"Of Dasaratha tidings tell:Is the old king my father well?Is Ráma, and is Lakshman, heOf the high-soul, from sickness free?And she who walks where duty leads,Kausalyá, known for gracious deeds,Mother of Ráma, loving spouse,Bound to her lord by well kept vows?And Lakshman mother too, the dameSumitrá skilled in duty claim,Who brave Satrughna also bare,Second in age,--her health declare.And she, in self-conceit most sage,With selfish heart most prone to rage,My mother, fares she well? has sheSent message or command to me?\"Thus Bharat spake, the mighty-souled,And they in brief their tidings told:\"All they of whom thou askest dwell,O lion lord, secure and well:Thine all the smiles of fortune are:Make ready; let them yoke the car.\"Thus by the royal envoys pressed,Bharat again the band addressed:\"I go with you: no long delay,A single hour I bid you stay.\"Thus Bharat, son of him who swayedAyodhyás realm, his answer made,And then bespoke, his heart to please,His mother sire in words like these:\"I go to see my father, King,Urged by the envoys\\' summoning;And when thy soul desires to seeThy grandson, will return to thee.\"The king his grandsire kissed his head,And in reply to Bharat said:\"Go forth, dear child: how blest is she,The mother of a son like thee!Greet well thy sire, thy mother greet,O thou whose arms the foe defeat;The household priest, and all the restAmid the Twice-born chief and best;And Ráma and brave Lakshman, whoShoot the long shaft with aim so true.\"To him the king high honour showed,And store of wealth and gifts bestowed,The choicest elephants to ride,And skins and blankets deftly dyed,A thousand strings of golden beads,And sixteen hundred mettled steeds:And boundless wealth before him piledGave Kekaya to Kaikeyí child.And men of counsel, good and tried,On whose firm truth he aye relied,King Asvapati gave with speedPrince Bharat on his way to lead.And noble elephants, strong and young,From sires of Indrasira sprung,And others tall and fair to viewOf great Airávat lineage true:And well yoked asses fleet of limbThe prince his uncle gave to him.And dogs within the palace bred,Of body vast and massive head,With mighty fangs for battle, brave,The tiger match in strength, he gave.Yet Bharat bosom hardly glowedTo see the wealth the king bestowed;For he would speed that hour away,Such care upon his bosom lay:Those eager envoys urged him thence,And that sad vision influence.He left his court-yard, crowded thenWith elephants and steeds and men,And, peerless in immortal fame,To the great royal street he came.He saw, as farther still he went,The inner rooms most excellent,And passed the doors, to him unclosed,Where check nor bar his way oppossd.There Bharat stayed to bid adieuTo grandsire and to uncle too,Then, with Satrughna by his side,Mounting his car, away he hied.The strong-wheeled cars were yoked, and theyMore than a hundred, rolled away:Servants, with horses, asses, kine,Followed their lord in endless line.So, guarded by his own right hand,Forth high-souled Bharat hied,Surrounded by a lordly bandOn whom the king relied.Beside him sat Satrughna dear,The scourge of trembling foes:Thus from the light of Indra sphereA saint made perfect goes.Canto LXXI. Bharat Return.Then Bharat face was eastward bentAs from the royal town he went.He reached Sudámá farther side,And glorious, gazed upon the tide;Passed Hládiní, and saw her tossHer westering billows hard to cross.Then old Ikshváku famous sonO\\'er Satadrú(348) his passage won,Near Ailadhána on the strand,And came to Aparparyat land.O\\'er Silá flood he hurried fast,Akurvatí fair stream he passed,Crossed o\\'er Ágneya rapid rill,And Salyakartan onward still.Silávahá swift stream he eyed,True to his vows and purified,Then crossed the lofty hills, and stoodIn Chaitraratha mighty wood.He reached the confluence where meetSarasvatí(349) and Gangá fleet,And through Bhárunda forest, spreadNorthward of Viramatsya, sped.He sought Kálinda child, who fillsThe soul with joy, begirt by hills,Reached Yamuná, and passing o\\'er,Rested his army on the shore:He gave his horses food and rest,Bathed reeking limb and drooping crest.They drank their fill and bathed them there,And water for their journey bare.Thence through a mighty wood he spedAll wild and uninhabited,As in fair chariot through the skies,Most fair in shape a Storm-God flies.At Ansudhána Gangá, hardTo cross, his onward journey barred,So turning quickly thence he cameTo Prágvat city dear to fame.There having gained the farther sideTo Kutikoshtiká he hied:The stream he crossed, and onward thenTo Dharmavardhan brought his men.Thence, leaving Toran on the north,To Jambuprastha journeyed forth.Then onward to a pleasant groveBy fair Varútha town he drove,And when a while he there had stayed,Went eastward from the friendly shade.Eastward of Ujjiháná whereThe Priyak trees are tall and fair,He passed, and rested there each steedExhausted with the journey speed.There orders to his men addressed,With quickened pace he onward pressed,A while at Sarvatírtha spent,Then o\\'er Uttániká he went.O\\'er many a stream beside he spedWith coursers on the mountains bred,And passing Hastiprishthak, tookThe road o\\'er Kutiká fair brook.Then, at Lohitya village, heCrossed o\\'er the swift Kapívatí,Then passed, where Ekasála stands,The Sthánumatí flood and sands,And Gomatí of fair renownBy Vinata delightful town.When to Kalinga near he drew,A wood of Sal trees charmed the view;That passed, the sun began to rise,And Bharat saw with happy eyes,Ayodhyá city, built and plannedBy ancient Manu royal hand.Seven nights upon the road had passed,And when he saw the town at lastBefore him in her beauty spread,Thus Bharat to the driver said:\"This glorious city from afar,Wherein pure groves and gardens are,Seems to my eager eyes to-dayA lifeless pile of yellow clay.Through all her streets where erst a throngOf men and women streamed along,Uprose the multitudinous roar:To-day I hear that sound no more.No longer do mine eyes beholdThe leading people, as of old,On elephants, cars, horses, goAbroad and homeward, to and fro.The brilliant gardens, where we heardThe wild note of each rapturous bird,Where men and women loved to meet,In pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,--These to my eyes this day appearJoyless, and desolate, and drear:Each tree that graced the garden grieves,And every path is spread with leaves.The merry cry of bird and beast,That spake aloud their joy, has ceased:Still is the long melodious noteThat charmed us from each warbling throat.Why blows the blessed air no more,The incense-breathing air that boreIts sweet incomparable scentOf sandal and of aloe blent?Why are the drum and tabour mute?Why is the music of the luteThat woke responsive to the quill,Loved by the happy, hushed and still?My boding spirit gathers henceDire sins of awful consequence,And omens, crowding on my sight,Weigh down my soul with wild affright.Scarce shall I find my friends who dwellHere in Ayodhyá safe and well:For surely not without a causeThis crushing dread my soul o\\'erawes.\"Heart sick, dejected, every senseConfused by terror influence,On to the town he quickly sweptWhich King Ikshváku children kept.He passed through Vaijayanta gate,With weary steeds, disconsolate,And all who near their station held,His escort, crying Victory, swelled,With heart distracted still he bowedFarewell to all the following crowd,Turned to the driver and beganTo question thus the weary man:\"Why was I brought, O free from blame,So fast, unknown for what I came?Yet fear of ill my heart appals,And all my wonted courage falls.For I have heard in days gone byThe changes seen when monarchs die;And all those signs, O charioteer,I see to-day surround me here:Each kinsman house looks dark and grim,No hand delights to keep it trim:The beauty vanished, and the pride,The doors, unkept, stand open wide.No morning rites are offered there,No grateful incense loads the air,And all therein, with brows o\\'ercast,Sit joyless on the ground and fast.Their lovely chaplets dry and dead,Their courts unswept, with dust o\\'erspread,The temples of the Gods to-dayNo more look beautiful and gay.Neglected stands each holy shrine,Each image of a Lord divine.No shop where flowery wreaths are soldIs bright and busy as of old.The women and the men I markAbsorbed in fancies dull and dark,Their gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,A poor afflicted multitude.\"His mind oppressed with woe and dread,Thus Bharat to his driver said,Viewed the dire signs Ayodhyá showed,And onward to the palace rode.Canto LXXII. Bharat Inquiry.He entered in, he looked around,Nor in the house his father found;Then to his mother dwelling, bentTo see her face, he quickly went.She saw her son, so long away,Returning after many a day,And from her golden seat in joySprung forward to her darling boy.Within the bower, no longer bright,Came Bharat lover of the right,And bending with observance sweetClasped his dear mother lovely feet.Long kisses on his brow she pressed,And held her hero to her breast,Then fondly drew him to her knees,And questioned him in words like these:\"How many nights have fled, since thouLeftest thy grandsire home, till now?By flying steeds so swiftly borne,Art thou not weak and travel-worn?How fares the king my father, tell:Is Yudhájit thine uncle well?And now, my son, at length declareThe pleasure of the visit there.\"Thus to the offspring of the kingShe spake with tender questioning,And to his mother made replyYoung Bharat of the lotus eye:\"The seventh night has come and fledSince from my grandsire home I sped:My mother sire is well, and he,Yudhájit, from all trouble free.The gold and every precious thingPresented by the conqueror king,The slower guards behind convey:I left them weary on the way.Urged by the men my father sent,My hasty course I hither bent:Now, I implore, an answer deign,And all I wish to know, explain.Unoccupied I now beholdThis couch of thine adorned with gold,And each of King Ikshváku raceAppears with dark and gloomy face.The king is aye, my mother dear,Most constant in his visits here.To meet my sire I sought this spot:How is it that I find him not?I long to clasp my father feet:Say where he lingers, I entreat.Perchance the monarch may be seenWhere dwells Kausalyá, eldest queen.\"His father fate, from him concealed,Kaikeyí to her son revealed:Told as glad news the story sad,For lust of sway had made her mad:\"Thy father, O my darling, know,Has gone the way all life must go:Devout and famed, of lofty thought,In whom the good their refuge sought.\"When Bharat pious, pure, and true,Heard the sad words which pierced him through,Grieved for the sire he loved so wellProstrate upon the ground he fell:Down fell the strong-armed hero, highTossing his arms, and a sad cry,\"Ah, woe is me, unhappy, slain!\"Burst from his lips again, again,Afflicted for his father fateBy grief intolerable weight,With every sense amazed and cowedThe splendid hero wailed aloud:\"Ah me, my royal father bedOf old a gentle radiance shed,Like the pure sky when clouds are past,And the moon light is o\\'er it cast:Ah, of its wisest lord bereft,It shows to-day faint radiance left,As when the moon has left the sky.Or mighty Ocean depths are dry.\"With choking sobs, with many a tear,Pierced to the heart with grief sincere,The best of conquerors poured his sighs,And with his robe veiled face and eyes.Kaikeyí saw him fallen there,Godlike, afflicted, in despair,Used every art to move him thence,And tried him thus with eloquence:\"Arise, arise, my dearest; whyWilt thou, famed Prince, so lowly lie?Not by such grief as this are movedGood men like thee, by all approved.The earth thy father nobly swayed,And rites to Heaven he duly paid.At length his race of life was run:Thou shouldst not mourn for him, my son.\"Long on the ground he wept, and rolledFrom side to side, still unconsoled,And then, with bitter grief oppressed,His mother with these words addressed:\"This joyful hope my bosom fedWhen from my grandsire halls I sped--\"The king will throne his eldest son,And sacrifice, as should be done.\"But all is changed, my hope was vain,And this sad heart is rent in twain,For my dear father face I miss,Who ever sought his loved ones\\' bliss.But in my absence, mother, say,What sickness took my sire away?Ah, happy Ráma, happy theyAllowed his funeral rites to pay!The glorious monarch has not learnedThat I his darling have returned,Or quickly had he hither sped,And pressed his kisses on my head.Where is that hand whose gentle touch,Most soft and kind I loved so much,The hand that loved to brush awayThe dust that on his darling lay?Quick, bear the news to Ráma ear;Tell the great chief that I am here:Brother, and sire, and friend, and allIs he, and I his trusty thrall.For noble hearts, to virtue true,Their sires in elder brothers view.To clasp his feet I fain would bow:He is my hope and refuge now.What said my glorious sire, who knewVirtue and vice, so brave and true?Firm in his vows, dear lady, say,What said he ere he passed away?What was his rede to me? I craveTo hear the last advice he gave.\"Thus closely questioned by the youth,Kaikeyí spoke the mournful truth:\"The high-souled monarch wept and sighed,For Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman, cried,Then, best of all who go to bliss,Passed to the world which follows this.\"Ah, blessed are the people whoShall Ráma and his Sítá view,And Lakshman of the mighty arm,Returning free from scathe and harm.\"Such were the words, the last of all,Thy father, ere he died, let fall,By Fate and Death dread coils enwound,As some great elephant is bound.\"He heard, yet deeper in despair,Her lips this double woe declare,And with sad brow that showed his painQuestioned his mother thus again:\"But where is he, of virtue tried,Who fills Kausalyá heart with pride,Where is the noble Ráma? whereIs Lakshman brave, and Sítá fair?\"Thus pressed, the queen began to tellThe story as each thing befell,And gave her son in words like these,The mournful news she meant to please:\"The prince is gone in hermit dressTo Dandak mighty wilderness,And Lakshman brave and Sítá shareThe wanderings of the exile there.\"Then Bharat soul with fear was stirredLest Ráma from the right had erred,And jealous for ancestral fame,He put this question to the dame:\"Has Ráma grasped with lawless holdA Bráhman house, or land, or gold?Has Ráma harmed with ill intentSome poor or wealthy innocent?Was Ráma, faithless to his vows,Enamoured of anothers spouse?Why was he sent to Dandak wild,Like one who kills an unborn child?\"He questioned thus: and she beganTo tell her deeds and crafty plan.Deceitful-hearted, fond, and blindAs is the way of womankind:\"No Bráhman wealth has Ráma seized,No dame his wandering fancy pleased;His very eyes he ne\\'er allowsTo gaze upon a neighbour spouse.But when I heard the monarch plannedTo give the realm to Ráma hand,I prayed that Ráma hence might flee,And claimed the throne, my son, for thee.The king maintained the name he bare,And did according to my prayer,And Ráma, with his brother, sent,And Sítá, forth to banishment.When his dear son was seen no more,The lord of earth was troubled sore:Too feeble with his grief to strive,He joined the elemental Five.Up then, most dutiful! maintainThe royal state, arise, and reign.For thee, my darling son, for theeAll this was planned and wrought by me.Come, cast thy grief and pain aside,With manly courage fortified.This town and realm are all thine own,And fear and grief are here unknown.Come, with Vasishtha guiding aid,And priests in ritual skilledLet the king funeral dues be paid,And every claim fulfilled.Perform his obsequies with allThat suits his rank and worth,Then give the mandate to installThyself as lord of earth.\"Canto LXXIII. Kaikeyí Reproached.But when he heard the queen relateHis brothers\\' doom, his father fate,Thus Bharat to his mother saidWith burning grief disquieted:\"Alas, what boots it now to reign,Struck down by grief and well-nigh slain?Ah, both are gone, my sire, and heWho was a second sire to me.Grief upon grief thy hand has made,And salt upon gashes laid:For my dear sire has died through thee,And Ráma roams a devotee.Thou camest like the night of FateThis royal house to devastate.Unwitting ill, my hapless sirePlaced in his bosom coals of fire,And through thy crimes his death he met,O thou whose heart on sin is set.Shame of thy house! thy senseless deedHas reft all joy from Raghu seed.The truthful monarch, dear to fame,Received thee as his wedded dame,And by thy act to misery doomedHas died by flames of grief consumed.Kausalyá and Sumitrá tooThe coming of my mother rue,And if they live oppressed by woe,For their dear sons their sad tears flow.Was he not ever good and kind,--That hero of the duteous mind?Skilled in all filial duties, heAs a dear mother treated thee.Kausalyá too, the eldest queen,Who far foresees with insight keen,Did she not ever show thee allA sister love at duty call?And hast thou from the kingdom chasedHer son, with bark around his waist,To the wild wood, to dwell therein,And dost not sorrow for thy sin?The love I bare to Raghu sonThou knewest not, ambitious one,If thou hast wrought this impious deedFor royal sway, in lawless greed.With him and Lakshman far away,What power have I the realm to sway?What hope will fire my bosom whenI see no more these lords of men?The holy king, who loved the rightRelied on Ráma power and might,His guardian and his glory, soJoys Meru in his woods below.How can I bear, a steer untrained,The load his mightier strength sustained?What power have I to brook aloneThis weight on feeble shoulders thrown?But if the needful power were boughtBy strength of mind and brooding thought,No triumph shall attend the dameWho dooms her son to lasting shame.Now should no doubt that son preventFrom quitting thee on evil bent.But Ráma love o\\'erpowers my will,Who holds thee as his mother still.Whence did the thought, O thou whose eyesAre turned to sinful deeds, arise--A plan our ancient sires would hate,O fallen from thy virtuous state?For in the line from which we springThe eldest is anointed king:No monarchs from the rule decline,And, least of all, Ikshváku line.Our holy sires, to virtue true,Upon our race a lustre threw,But with subversive frenzy thouHast marred our lineal honour now,Of lofty birth, a noble lineOf previous kings is also thine:Then whence this hated folly? whenceThis sudden change that steals thy sense?Thou shalt not gain thine impious will,O thou whose thoughts are bent on ill,Thou from whose guilty hand descendThese sinful blows my life to end.Now to the forest will I go,Thy cherished plans to overthrow,And bring my brother, free from stain,His people darling, home again.And Ráma, when again he turns,Whose glory like a beacon burns,In me a faithful slave shall findTo serve him with contented mind.\"Canto LXXIV. Bharat Lament.When Bharat anger-sharpened tongueReproaches on the queen had flung,Again, with mighty rage possessed,The guilty dame he thus addressed:\"Flee, cruel, wicked sinner, flee,Let not this kingdom harbour thee.Thou who hast thrown all right aside,Weep thou for me when I have died.Canst thou one charge against the king,Or the most duteous Ráma bring?The one thy sin to death has sent,The other chased to banishment.Our line destroyer, sin defiledLike one who kills an unborn child,Ne\\'er with thy lord in heaven to dwell,Thy portion shall be down in hellBecause thy hand, that stayed for naught,This awful wickedness has wrought,And ruined him whom all held dear,My bosom too is stirred with fear.My father by thy sin is dead,And Ráma to the wood is fled;And of thy deed I bear the stain,And fameless in the world remain.Ambitious, evil-souled, in showMy mother, yet my direst foe.My throning ne\\'er thine eyes shall bless,Thy husband wicked murderess.Thou art not Asvapati child,That righteous king most sage and mild,But thou wast born a fiend, a foeMy father house to overthrow.Thou who hast made Kausalyá, pure,Gentle, affectionate, endureThe loss of him who was her bliss,--What worlds await thee, Queen, for this?Was it not patent to thy senseThat Ráma was his friends\\' defence,Kausalyá own true child most dear,The eldest and his father peer?Men in the son not only traceThe father figure, form, and face,But in his heart they also findThe offspring of the father mind;And hence, though dear their kinsmen are,To mothers sons are dearer far.There goes an ancient legend howGood Surabhí, the God-loved cow,Saw two of her dear children strain,Drawing a plough and faint with pain.She saw them on the earth outworn,Toiling till noon from early morn,And as she viewed her children woe,A flood of tears began to flow.As through the air beneath her sweptThe Lord of Gods, the drops she wept,Fine, laden with delicious smell,Upon his heavenly body fell.And Indra lifted up his eyesAnd saw her standing in the skies,Afflicted with her sorrow weight,Sad, weeping, all disconsolate.The Lord of Gods in anxious moodThus spoke in suppliant attitude:\"No fear disturbs our rest, and howCome this great dread upon thee now?Whence can this woe upon thee fall,Say, gentle one who lovest all?\"Thus spake the God who rules the skies,Indra, the Lord supremely wise;And gentle Surabhí, well learnedIn eloquence, this speech returned:\"Not thine the fault, great God, not thineAnd guiltless are the Lords divine:I mourn two children faint with toil,Labouring hard in stubborn soil.Wasted and sad I see them now,While the sun beats on neck and brow,Still goaded by the cruel hind,--No pity in his savage mind.O Indra, from this body sprangThese children, worn with many a pang.For this sad sight I mourn, for noneIs to the mother like her son.\"He saw her weep whose offspring feedIn thousands over hill and mead,And knew that in a mother eyeNaught with a son, for love, can vie.He deemed her, when the tears that cameFrom her sad eyes bedewed his frame,Laden with their celestial scent,Of living things most excellent.If she these tears of sorrow shedWho many a thousand children bred,Think what a life of woe is leftKausalyá, of her Ráma reft.An only son was hers and sheIs rendered childless now by thee.Here and hereafter, for thy crime,Woe is thy lot through endless time.And now, O Queen, without delay,With all due honour will I payBoth to my brother and my sireThe rites their several fates require.Back to Ayodhyá will I bringThe long-armed chief, her lord and king,And to the wood myself betakeWhere hermit saints their dwelling make.For, sinner both in deed and thought!This hideous crime which thou hast wroughtI cannot bear, or live to seeThe people sad eyes bent on me.Begone, to Dandak wood retire,Or cast thy body to the fire,Or bind around thy neck the rope:No other refuge mayst thou hope.When Ráma, lord of valour true,Has gained the earth, his right and due,Then, free from duty binding debt,My vanished sin shall I forget.\"Thus like an elephant forced to brookThe goading of the driver hook,Quick panting like a serpent maimed,He fell to earth with rage inflamed.Canto LXXV. The Abjuration.A while he lay: he rose at length,And slowly gathering sense and strength,With angry eyes which tears bedewed,The miserable queen he viewed,And spake with keen reproach to herBefore each lord and minister:\"No lust have I for kingly sway,My mother I no more obey:Naught of this consecration knewWhich Dasaratha kept in view.I with Satrughna all the timeWas dwelling in a distant clime:I knew of Ráma exile naught,That hero of the noble thought:I knew not how fair Sítá went,And Lakshman, forth to banishment.\"Thus high-souled Bharat, mid the crowd,Lifted his voice and cried aloud.Kausalyá heard, she raised her head,And quickly to Sumitrá said:\"Bharat, Kaikeyí son is here,--Hers whose fell deeds I loathe and fear:That youth of foresight keen I fainWould meet and see his face again.\"Thus to Sumitrá spake the dame,And straight to Bharat presence cameWith altered mien, neglected dress,Trembling and faint with sore distress.Bharat, Satrughna by his side,To meet her, toward her palace hied.And when the royal dame they viewedDistressed with dire solicitude,Sad, fallen senseless on the ground,About her neck their arms they wound.The noble matron prostrate there,Embraced, with tears, the weeping pair,And with her load of grief oppressed,To Bharat then these words addressed:\"Now all is thine, without a foe,This realm for which thou longest so.Ah, soon Kaikeyí ruthless handHas won the empire of the land,And made my guiltless Ráma fleeDressed like some lonely devotee.Herein what profit has the queen,Whose eye delights in havoc, seen?Me also, me \\'twere surely goodTo banish to the distant wood,To dwell amid the shades that holdMy famous son with limbs like gold.Nay, with the sacred fire to guide,Will I, Sumitrá by my side,Myself to the drear wood repairAnd seek the son of Raghu there.This land which rice and golden cornAnd wealth of every kind adorn,Car, elephant, and steed, and gem,--She makes thee lord of it and them.\"With taunts like these her bitter tongueThe heart of blameless Bharat wrungAnd direr pangs his bosom toreThan when the lancet probes a sore.With troubled senses all astrayProne at her feet he fell and lay.With loud lament a while he plained,And slowly strength and sense regained.With suppliant hand to hand appliedHe turned to her who wept and sighed,And thus bespake the queen, whose breastWith sundry woes was sore distressed:\"Why these reproaches, noble dame?I, knowing naught, am free from blame.Thou knowest well what love was mineFor Ráma, chief of Raghu line.O, never be his darkened mindTo Scripture guiding lore inclined,By whose consent the prince who ledThe good, the truthful hero, fled.May he obey the vilest lord,Offend the sun with act abhorred,(350)And strike a sleeping cow, who lentHis voice to Ráma banishment.May the good king who all befriends,And, like his sons, the people tends,Be wronged by him who gave consentTo noble Ráma banishment.On him that king injustice fall,Who takes, as lord, a sixth of all,Nor guards, neglectful of his trust,His people, as a ruler must.The crime of those who swear to fee,At holy rites, some devotee,And then the promised gift deny,Be his who willed the prince should fly.When weapons clash and heroes bleed,With elephant and harnessed steed,Ne\\'er, like the good, be his to fightWhose heart allowed the prince flight.Though taught with care by one expertMay he the Veda text pervert,With impious mind on evil bent,Whose voice approved the banishment.May he with traitor lips revealWhate\\'er he promised to conceal,And bruit abroad his friend offence,Betrayed by generous confidence.No wife of equal lineage bornThe wretch joyless home adorn:Ne\\'er may he do one virtuous deed,And dying see no child succeed.When in the battle awful dayFierce warriors stand in dread array,Let the base coward turn and fly,And smitten by the foeman, die.Long may he wander, rags his wear,Doomed in his hand a skull to bear,And like an idiot beg his bread,Who gave consent when Ráma fled.His sin who holy rites forgets,Asleep when shows the sun and sets,A load upon his soul shall lieWhose will allowed the prince to fly.His sin who loves his Master dame,His, kindler of destructive flame,His who betrays his trusting friendShall, mingled all, on him descend.By him no reverence due be paidTo blessed God or parted shade:May sire and mother sacred nameIn vain from him obedience claim.Ne\\'er may he go where dwell the good,Nor win their fame and neighbourhood,But lose all hopes of bliss to-day,Who willed the prince should flee away.May he deceive the poor and weakWho look to him and comfort seek,Betray the suppliants who complain,And make the hopeful hope in vain.Long may his wife his kiss expect,And pine away in cold neglect.May he his lawful love despise,And turn on other dames his eyes,Fool, on forbidden joys intent,Whose will allowed the banishment.His sin who deadly poison throwsTo spoil the water as it flows,Lay on the wretch its burden dreadWho gave consent when Ráma fled.\"(351)Thus with his words he undeceivedKausalyá troubled heart, who grievedFor son and husband reft away;Then prostrate on the ground he lay.Him as he lay half-senseless there,Freed by the mighty oaths he sware,Kausalyá, by her woe distressed,With melancholy words addressed:\"Anew, my son, this sorrow springsTo rend my heart with keener stings:These awful oaths which thou hast swornMy breast with double grief have torn.Thy soul, and faithful Lakshman too,Are still, thank Heaven! to virtue true.True to thy promise, thou shalt gainThe mansions which the good obtain.\"Then to her breast that youth she drew,Whose sweet fraternal love she knew,And there in strict embraces heldThe hero, as her tears outwelled.And Bharat heart grew sick and faintWith grief and oft-renewed complaint,And all his senses were distraughtBy the great woe that in him wrought.Thus he lay and still bewailedWith sighs and loud lamentTill all his strength and reason failed,The hours of night were spent.Canto LXXVI. The Funeral.The saint Vasishtha, best of allWhose words with moving wisdom fall,Bharat, Kaikeyí son, addressed,Whom burning fires of grief distressed:\"O Prince, whose fame is widely spread,Enough of grief: be comforted.The time is come: arise, and layUpon the pyre the monarch clay.\"He heard the words Vasishtha spoke,And slumbering resolution woke.Then skilled in all the laws declare,He bade his friends the rites prepare.They raised the body from the oil,And placed it, dripping, on the soil;Then laid it on a bed, whereonWrought gold and precious jewels shone.There, pallor o\\'er his features spread,The monarch, as in sleep, lay dead.Then Bharat sought his father side,And lifted up his voice and cried:\"O King, and has thy heart designedTo part and leave thy son behind?Make Ráma flee, who loves the right,And Lakshman of the arm of might?Whither, great Monarch, wilt thou goAnd leave this people in their woe,Mourning their hero, wild with grief,Of Ráma reft, their lion chief?Ah, who will guard the people wellWho in Ayodhyá city dwell,When thou, my sire, hast sought the sky,And Ráma has been forced to fly?In widowed woe, bereft of thee,The land no more is fair to see:The city, to my aching sight,Is gloomy as a moonless night.\"Thus, with o\\'erwhelming sorrow pained,Sad Bharat by the bed complained:And thus Vasishtha, holy sage,Spoke his deep anguish to assuage:\"O Lord of men, no longer stay;The last remaining duties pay:Haste, mighty-armed, as I advise,The funeral rites to solemnize.\"And Bharat heard Vasishtha redeWith due attention and agreed.He summoned straight from every sideChaplain, and priest, and holy guide.The sacred fires he bade them bringForth from the chapel of the king,Wherein the priests in order due,And ministers, the offerings threw.Distraught in mind, with sob and tear,They laid the body on a bier,And servants, while their eyes brimmed o\\'erThe monarch from the palace bore.Another band of mourners ledThe long procession of the dead:Rich garments in the way they cast,And gold and silver, as they passed.Then other hands the corse bedewedWith fragrant juices that exudeFrom sandal, cedar, aloe, pine,And every perfume rare and fine.Then priestly hands the mighty deadUpon the pyre deposited.The sacred fires they tended next,And muttered low each funeral text;And priestly singers who rehearseThe Saman(352) sang their holy verse.Forth from the town in litters came,Or chariots, many a royal dame,And honoured so the funeral ground,With aged followers ringed around.With steps in inverse order bent,(353)The priests in sad procession wentAround the monarch burning pyreWho well had nursed each sacred fire:With Queen Kausalyá and the rest,Their tender hearts with woe distressed.The voice of women, shrill and clearAs screaming curlews, smote the ear,As from a thousand voices roseThe shriek that tells of woman woes.Then weeping, faint, with loud lament,Down Sarjú shelving bank they went.There standing on the river sideWith Bharat, priest, and peer,Their lips the women purifiedWith water fresh and clear.Returning to the royal town,Their eyes with tear-drops filled,Ten days on earth they laid them down,And wept till grief was stilled.Canto LXXVII. The Gathering Of The Ashes.The tenth day passed: the prince againWas free from every legal stain.He bade them on the twelfth the greatRemaining honour celebrate.Much gold he gave, and gems, and food,To all the Bráhman multitude,And goats whose hair was white and fine,And many a thousand head of kine:Slaves, men and damsels, he bestowed,And many a car and fair abode:Such gifts he gave the Bráhman raceHis father obsequies to grace.Then when the morning earliest rayAppeared upon the thirteenth day,Again the hero wept and sighedDistraught and sorrow-stupefied;Drew, sobbing in his anguish, near,The last remaining debt to clear,And at the bottom of the pyre,He thus bespake his royal sire:\"O father, hast thou left me so,Deserted in my friendless woe,When he to whom the charge was givenTo keep me, to the wood is driven?Her only son is forced awayWho was his helpless mother stay:Ah, whither, father, art thou fled;Leaving the queen uncomforted?\"He looked upon the pile where layThe bones half-burnt and ashes grey,And uttering a piteous moan,Gave way, by anguish overthrown.Then as his tears began to well,Prostrate to earth the hero fell;So from its seat the staff they drag,And cast to earth some glorious flag.The ministers approached againThe prince whom rites had freed from stain;So when Yayáti fell, each seer,In pity for his fate, drew near.Satrughna saw him lying lowO\\'erwhelmed beneath the crush of woe,And as upon the king he thought,He fell upon the earth distraught.When to his loving memory cameThose noble gifts, that kingly frame,He sorrowed, by his woe distressed,As one by frenzied rage possessed:\"Ah me, this surging sea of woeHas drowned us with its overflow:The source is Manthará, dire and dark,Kaikeyí is the ravening shark:And the great boons the monarch gaveLend conquering might to every wave.Ah, whither wilt thou go, and leaveThy Bharat in his woe to grieve,Whom ever \\'twas thy greatest joyTo fondle as a tender boy?Didst thou not give with thoughtful careOur food, our drink, our robes to wear?Whose love will now for us provide,When thou, our king and sire, hast died?At such a time bereft, forlorn,Why is not earth in sunder torn,Missing her monarch firm control,His love of right, his lofty soul?Ah me, for Ráma roams afar,My sire is where the Blessed are;How can I live deserted? IWill pass into the fire and die.Abandoned thus, I will not brookUpon Ayodhyá town to look,Once guarded by Ikshváku race:The wood shall be my dwelling place.\"Then when the princes\\' mournful trainHeard the sad brothers thus complain,And saw their misery, at the viewTheir grief burst wilder out anew.Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,Each like a bull with broken horn,The brothers in their wild despairLay rolling, mad with misery, there.Then old Vasishtha good and true,Their father priest, all lore who knew,Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,And thus bespake with counsel meet:\"Twelve days, my lord, have past awaySince flames consumed thy father clay:Delay no more: as rules ordain,Gather what bones may yet remain.Three constant pairs are ever foundTo hem all mortal creatures round:(354)Then mourn not thus, O Prince, for noneTheir close companionship may shun.\"Sumantra bade Satrughna rise,And soothed his soul with counsel wise,And skilled in truth, his hearer taughtHow all things are and come to naught.When rose each hero from the ground,A lion lord of men, renowned,He showed like Indra flag,(355) whereonFierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.They wiped their red and weeping eyes,And gently made their sad replies:Then, urged to haste, the royal pairPerformed the rites that claimed their care.Canto LXXVIII. Manthará Punished.Satrughna thus to Bharat spakeWho longed the forest road to take:\"He who in woe was wont to giveStrength to himself and all that live--Dear Ráma, true and pure in heart,Is banished by a woman art.Yet here was Lakshman, brave and strong,Could not his might prevent the wrong?Could not his arm the king restrain,Or make the banished free again?One loving right and fearing crimeHad checked the monarch sin in time,When, vassal of a woman will,His feet approached the path of ill.\"While Lakshman younger brother, dreadSatrughna, thus to Bharat said,Came to the fronting door, arrayedIn glittering robes, the hump-back maid.There she, with sandal-oil besmeared,In garments meet for queens appeared:And lustre to her form was lentBy many a gem and ornament.She girdled with her broidered zone,And many a chain about her thrown,Showed like a female monkey roundWhose body many a string is bound.When on that cause of evil fellThe quick eye of the sentinel,He grasped her in his ruthless hold,And hastening in, Satrughna told:\"Here is the wicked pest,\" he cried,\"Through whom the king thy father died,And Ráma wanders in the wood:Do with her as thou deemest good.\"The warder spoke: and every wordSatrughna breast to fury stirred:He called the servants, all and each.And spake in wrath his hasty speech:\"This is the wretch my sire who slew,And misery on my brothers drew:Let her this day obtain the meed,Vile sinner, of her cruel deed.\"He spake; and moved by fury laidHis mighty hand upon the maid,Who as her fellows ringed her round,Made with her cries the hall resound.Soon as the gathered women viewedSatrughna in his angry mood,Their hearts disturbed by sudden dread,They turned and from his presence fled.\"His rage,\" they cried, \"on us will fall,And ruthless, he will slay us all.Come, to Kausalyá let us flee:Our hope, our sure defence is she,Approved by all, of virtuous mind,Compassionate, and good, and kind.\"His eyes with burning wrath aglow,Satrughna, shatterer of the foe,Dragged on the ground the hump-back maidWho shrieked aloud and screamed for aid.This way and that with no remorseHe dragged her with resistless force,And chains and glittering trinkets burstLay here and there with gems dispersed,Till like the sky of Autumn shoneThe palace floor they sparkled on.The lord of men, supremely strong,Haled in his rage the wretch along:Where Queen Kaikeyí dwelt he came,And sternly then addressed the dame.Deep in her heart Kaikeyí feltThe stabs his keen reproaches dealt,And of Satrughna ire afraid,To Bharat flew and cried for aid.He looked and saw the prince inflamedWith burning rage, and thus exclaimed:\"Forgive! thine angry arm restrain:A woman never may be slain.My hand Kaikeyí blood would spill,The sinner ever bent on ill,But Ráma, long in duty tried,Would hate the impious matricide:And if he knew thy vengeful bladeHad slaughtered e\\'en this hump-back maid,Never again, be sure, would heSpeak friendly word to thee or me.\"When Bharat speech Satrughna heardHe calmed the rage his breast that stirred,Releasing from her dire constraintThe trembling wretch with terror faint.Then to Kaikeyí feet she crept,And prostrate in her misery wept.Kaikeyí on the hump-back gazed,And saw her weep and gasp.Still quivering, with her senses dazed,From fierce Satrughna grasp.With gentle words of pity sheAssuaged her wild despair,E\\'en as a tender hand might freeA curlew from the snare.Canto LXXIX. Bharat Commands.Now when the sun returning rayHad ushered in the fourteenth day,The gathered peers of state addressedTo Bharat ear their new request:\"Our lord to heaven has parted hence,Long served with deepest reverence;Ráma, the eldest, far from home,And Lakshman, in the forest roam.O Prince, of mighty fame, be thouOur guardian and our monarch now,Lest secret plot or foeman hateAssail our unprotected state.With longing eyes, O Lord of men,To thee look friend and citizen,And ready is each sacred thingTo consecrate our chosen king.Come, Bharat, and accept thine ownAncient hereditary throne.Thee let the priests this day installAs monarch to preserve us all.\"Around the sacred gear he bentHis circling footsteps reverent,And, firm to vows he would not break,Thus to the gathered people spake:\"The eldest son is ever king:So rules the house from which we spring:Nor should ye, Lords, like men unwise,With words like these to wrong advise.Ráma is eldest born, and heThe ruler of the land shall be.Now to the woods will I repair,Five years and nine to lodge me there.Assemble straight a mighty force,Cars, elephants, and foot and horse,For I will follow on his trackAnd bring my eldest brother back.Whate\\'er the rites of throning needPlaced on a car the way shall lead:The sacred vessels I will takeTo the wild wood for Ráma sake.I o\\'er the lion prince headThe sanctifying balm will shed,And bring him, as the fire they bringForth from the shrine, with triumphing.Nor will I let my mother greedIn this her cherished aim succeed:In pathless wilds will I remain,And Ráma here as king shall reign.To make the rough ways smooth and clearSend workman out and pioneer:Let skilful men attend besideOur way through pathless spots to guide.\"As thus the royal Bharat spake,Ordaining all for Ráma sake,The audience gave with one accordAuspicious answer to their lord:\"Be royal Fortune aye benignTo thee for this good speech of thine,Who wishest still thine elder handTo rule with kingly sway the land.\"Their glorious speech, their favouring criesMade his proud bosom swell:And from the prince noble eyesThe tears of rapture fell.(356)Canto LXXX. The Way Prepared.All they who knew the joiner art,Or distant ground in every part;Each busied in his several trade,To work machines or ply the spade;Deft workmen skilled to frame the wheel,Or with the ponderous engine deal;Guides of the way, and craftsmen skilled,To sink the well, make bricks, and build;And those whose hands the tree could hew,And work with slips of cut bamboo,Went forward, and to guide them, theyWhose eyes before had seen the way.Then onward in triumphant moodWent all the mighty multitude.Like the great sea whose waves leap highWhen the full moon is in the sky.Then, in his proper duty skilled,Each joined him to his several guild,And onward in advance they wentWith every tool and implement.Where bush and tangled creeper layWith trenchant steel they made the way;They felled each stump, removed each stone,And many a tree was overthrown.In other spots, on desert lands,Tall trees were reared by busy hands.Where\\'er the line of road they took,They plied the hatchet, axe, and hook.Others, with all their strength applied,Cast vigorous plants and shrubs aside,In shelving valleys rooted deep,And levelled every dale and steep.Each pit and hole that stopped the wayThey filled with stones, and mud, and clay,And all the ground that rose and fellWith busy care was levelled well.They bridged ravines with ceaseless toil,And pounded fine the flinty soil.Now here, now there, to right and left,A passage through the ground they cleft,And soon the rushing flood was ledAbundant through the new-cut bed,Which by the running stream suppliedWith ocean boundless waters vied.In dry and thirsty spots they sankFull many a well and ample tank,And altars round about them placedTo deck the station in the waste.With well-wrought plaster smoothly spread,With bloomy trees that rose o\\'erhead,With banners waving in the air,And wild birds singing here and there,With fragrant sandal-water wet,With many a flower beside it set,Like the Gods\\' heavenly pathway showedThat mighty host imperial road.Deft workmen, chosen for their skillTo do the high-souled Bharat will,In every pleasant spot where grewTrees of sweet fruit and fair to view,As he commanded, toiled to graceWith all delights his camping-place.And they who read the stars, and wellEach lucky sign and hour could tell,Raised carefully the tented shadeWherein high-minded Bharat stayed.With ample space of level ground,With broad deep moat encompassed round;Like Mandar in his towering pride,With streets that ran from side to side;Enwreathed with many a palace tallSurrounded by its noble wall;With roads by skilful workmen made,Where many a glorious banner played;With stately mansions, where the doveSat nestling in her cote above.Rising aloft supremely fairLike heavenly cars that float in air,Each camp in beauty and in blissMatched Indra own metropolis.As shines the heaven on some fair night,With moon and constellations filled,The prince royal road was bright,Adorned by art of workmen skilled.Canto LXXXI. The Assembly.Ere yet the dawn had ushered inThe day should see the march begin,Herald and bard who rightly knewEach nice degree of honour due,Their loud auspicious voices raised,And royal Bharat blessed and praised.With sticks of gold the drum they smote,Which thundered out its deafening note,Blew loud the sounding shell, and blentEach high and low-toned instrument.The mingled sound of drum and hornThrough all the air was quickly borne,And as in Bharat ear it rang,Gave the sad prince another pang.Then Bharat, starting from repose,Stilled the glad sounds that round him rose,\"I am not king; no more mistake:\"Then to Satrughna thus he spake:\"O see what general wrongs succeedSprung from Kaikeyí evil deed!The king my sire has died and thrownFresh miseries on me alone.The royal bliss, on duty based,Which our just high-souled father graced,Wanders in doubt and sore distressLike a tossed vessel rudderless.And he who was our lordly stayRoams in the forest far away,Expelled by this my mother, whoTo duty law is most untrue.\"As royal Bharat thus gave ventTo bitter grief in wild lament,Gazing upon his face the crowdOf pitying women wept aloud.His lamentation scarce was o\\'er,When Saint Vasishtha, skilled in loreOf royal duty, dear to fame,To join the great assembly came.Girt by disciples ever trueStill nearer to that hall he drew,Resplendent, heavenly to behold,Adorned with wealth of gems and gold:E\\'en so a man in duty triedDraws near to meet his virtuous bride.He reached his golden seat o\\'erlaidWith coverlet of rich brocade,There sat, in all the Vedas read,And called the messengers, and said:\"Go forth, let Bráhman, Warrior, peer,And every captain gather here:Let all attentive hither throng:Go, hasten: we delay too long.Satrughna, glorious Bharat bring,The noble children of the king,(357)Yudhájit(358) and Sumantra, allThe truthful and the virtuous call.\"He ended: soon a mighty soundOf thickening tumult rose around,As to the hall they bent their courseWith car, and elephant, and horse,The people all with glad acclaimWelcomed Prince Bharat as he came:E\\'en as they loved their king to greet,Or as the Gods Lord Indra(359) meet.The vast assembly shone as fairWith Bharat kingly faceAs Dasaratha self were thereTo glorify the place.It gleamed like some unruffled lakeWhere monsters huge of mouldWith many a snake their pastime takeO\\'er shells, sand, gems, and gold.Canto LXXXII. The Departure.The prudent prince the assembly viewedThronged with its noble multitude,Resplendent as a cloudless nightWhen the full moon is in his height;While robes of every varied hueA glory o\\'er the synod threw.The priest in lore of duty skilledLooked on the crowd the hall that filled,And then in accents soft and graveTo Bharat thus his counsel gave:\"The king, dear son, so good and wise,Has gone from earth and gained the skies,Leaving to thee, her rightful lord,This rich wide land with foison stored.And still has faithful Ráma stoodFirm to the duty of the good,And kept his father hest aright,As the moon keeps its own dear light.Thus sire and brother yield to theeThis realm from all annoyance free:Rejoice thy lords: enjoy thine own:Anointed king, ascend the throne.Let vassal Princes hasten forthFrom distant lands, west, south, and north,From Kerala,(360) from every sea,And bring ten million gems to thee.\"As thus the sage Vasishtha spoke,A storm of grief o\\'er Bharat broke.And longing to be just and true,His thoughts to duteous Ráma flew.With sobs and sighs and broken tones,E\\'en as a wounded mallard moans,He mourned with deepest sorrow moved,And thus the holy priest reproved:\"O, how can such as Bharat dareThe power and sway from him to tear,Wise, and devout, and true, and chaste,With Scripture lore and virtue graced?Can one of Dasaratha seedBe guilty of so vile a deed?The realm and I are Ráma: thou,Shouldst speak the words of justice now.For he, to claims of virtue true,Is eldest born and noblest too:Nahush, Dilípa could not beMore famous in their lives than he.As Dasaratha ruled of right,So Ráma is the power and right.If I should do this sinful deedAnd forfeit hope of heavenly meed,My guilty act would dim the shineOf old Ikshváku glorious line.Nay, as the sin my mother wroughtIs grievous to my inmost thought,I here, my hands together laid,Will greet him in the pathless shade.To Ráma shall my steps be bent,My King, of men most excellent,Raghu illustrious son, whose swayMight hell, and earth, and heaven obey.\"That righteous speech, whose every wordBore virtue stamp, the audience heard;On Ráma every thought was set,And with glad tears each eye was wet.\"Then, if the power I still should lackTo bring my noble brother back,I in the wood will dwell, and shareHis banishment with Lakshman there.By every art persuasive ITo bring him from the wood will try,And show him to your loving eyes,O Bráhmans noble, good, and wise.E\\'en now, the road to make and clear,Each labourer pressed, and pioneerHave I sent forward to precedeThe army I resolve to lead.\"Thus, by fraternal love possessed,His firm resolve the prince expressed,Then to Sumantra, deeply readIn holy texts, he turned and said:\"Sumantra, rise without delay,And as I bid my words obey.Give orders for the march with speed,And all the army hither lead.\"The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,Obeyed the high-souled chief behest.He hurried forth with joy inspiredAnd gave the orders he desired.Delight each soldier bosom filled,And through each chief and captain thrilled,To hear that march proclaimed, to bringDear Ráma back from wandering.From house to house the tidings flew:Each soldier wife the order knew,And as she listened blithe and gayHer husband urged to speed away.Captain and soldier soon declaredThe host equipped and all preparedWith chariots matching thought for speed,And wagons drawn by ox and steed.When Bharat by Vasishtha side,His ready host of warriors eyed,Thus in Sumantra ear he spoke:\"My car and horses quickly yoke.\"Sumantra hastened to fulfilWith ready joy his master will,And quickly with the chariot spedDrawn by fleet horses nobly bred.Then glorious Bharat, true, devout,Whose genuine valour none could doubt,Gave in fit words his order out;For he would seek the shadeOf the great distant wood, and thereWin his dear brother with his prayer:\"Sumantra, haste! my will declareThe host be all arrayed.I to the wood my way will take,To Ráma supplication make,And for the world advantage sake,Will lead him home again.\"Then, ordered thus, the charioteerWho listened with delighted ear,Went forth and gave his orders clearTo captains of the train.He gave the popular chiefs the word,And with the news his friends he stirred,And not a single man deferredPreparing for the road.Then Bráhman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,Obedient to Sumantra call,Each in his house arose, and allYoked elephant or camel tall,Or ass or noble steed in stall,And full appointed showed.Canto LXXXIII. The Journey Begun.Then Bharat rose at early morn,And in his noble chariot borneDrove forward at a rapid paceEager to look on Ráma face.The priests and lords, a fair array,In sun-bright chariots led the way.Behind, a well appointed throng,Nine thousand elephants streamed along.Then sixty thousand cars, and then,With various arms, came fighting men.A hundred thousand archers showedIn lengthened line the steeds they rode--A mighty host, the march to graceOf Bharat, pride of Raghu race.Kaikeyí and Sumitrá came,And good Kausalyá, dear to fame:By hopes of Ráma coming cheeredThey in a radiant car appeared.On fared the noble host to seeRáma and Lakshman, wild with glee,And still each other ear to please,Of Ráma spoke in words like these:\"When shall our happy eyes beholdOur hero true, and pure, and bold,So lustrous dark, so strong of arm,Who keeps the world from woe and harm?The tears that now our eyeballs dimWill vanish at the sight of him,As the whole world black shadows flyWhen the bright sun ascends the sky.\"Conversing thus their way pursuedThe city joyous multitude,And each in mutual rapture pressedA friend or neighbour to his breast.Thus every man of high renown,And every merchant of the town,And leading subjects, joyous wentToward Ráma in his banishment.And those who worked the potter wheel,And artists skilled in gems to deal;And masters of the weaver art,And those who shaped the sword and dart;And they who golden trinkets made,And those who plied the fuller trade;And servants trained the bath to heat,And they who dealt in incense sweet;Physicians in their business skilled,And those who wine and mead distilled;And workmen deft in glass who wrought,And those whose snares the peacock caught;With them who bored the ear for rings,Or sawed, or fashioned ivory things;And those who knew to mix cement,Or lived by sale of precious scent;And men who washed, and men who sewed,And thralls who mid the herds abode;And fishers of the flood, and theyWho played and sang, and women gay;And virtuous Bráhmans, Scripture-wise,Of life approved in all men eyes;These swelled the prince lengthened train,Borne each in car or bullock wain.Fair were the robes they wore uponTheir limbs where red-hued unguents shone.These all in various modes conveyedTheir journey after Bharat made;The soldiers\\' hearts with rapture glowed,Following Bharat on his road,Their chief whose tender love would fainBring his dear brother home again.With elephant, and horse, and car,The vast procession travelled far,And came where Gangá waves belowThe town of Sringavera(361) flow.There, with his friends and kinsmen nigh,Dwelt Guha, Ráma dear ally,Heroic guardian of the landWith dauntless heart and ready hand.There for a while the mighty forceThat followed Bharat stayed its course,Gazing on Gangá bosom stirredBy many a graceful water-bird.When Bharat viewed his followers there,And Gangá water, blest and fair,The prince, who lore of words possessed,His councillors and lords addressed:\"The captains of the army call:Proclaim this day a halt for all,That so to-morrow, rested, weMay cross this flood that seeks the sea.Meanwhile, descending to the shore,The funeral stream I fain would pourFrom Gangá fair auspicious tideTo him, my father glorified.\"Thus Bharat spoke: each peer and lordApproved his words with one accord,And bade the weary troops reposeIn separate spots where\\'er they chose.There by the mighty stream that day,Most glorious in its vast arrayThe prince wearied army layIn various groups reclined.There Bharat hours of night were spent,While every eager thought he bentOn bringing home from banishmentHis brother, great of mind.Canto LXXXIV. Guha Anger.King Guha saw the host spread o\\'erThe wide expanse of Gangá shore,With waving flag and pennon graced,And to his followers spoke in haste:\"A mighty army meets my eyes,That rivals Ocean self in size:Where\\'er I look my very mindNo limit to the host can find.Sure Bharat with some evil thoughtHis army to our land has brought.See, huge of form, his flag he rears,That like an Ebony-tree appears.He comes with bonds to take and chain,Or triumph o\\'er our people slain:And after, Ráma will he slay,--Him whom his father drove away:The power complete he longs to gain,And--task too hard--usurp the reign.So Bharat comes with wicked willHis brother Ráma blood to spill.But Ráma slave and friend am I;He is my lord and dear ally.Keep here your watch in arms arrayedNear Gangá flood to lend him aid,And let my gathered servants standAnd line with troops the river strand.Here let the river keepers meet,Who flesh and roots and berries eat;A hundred fishers man each boatOf the five hundred here afloat,And let the youthful and the strongAssemble in defensive throng.But yet, if, free from guilty thought\\'Gainst Ráma, he this land have sought,The prince happy host to-dayAcross the flood shall make its way.\"He spoke: then bearing in a dishA gift of honey, meat, and fish,The king of the Nishádas drewToward Bharat for an interview.When Bharat noble charioteerObserved the monarch hastening near,He duly, skilled in courteous lore,The tidings to his master bore:\"This aged prince who hither bendsHis footsteps with a thousand friends,Knows, firm ally of Ráma, allThat may in Dandak wood befall:Therefore, Kakutstha son, admitThe monarch, as is right and fit:For doubtless he can clearly tellWhere Ráma now and Lakshman dwell.\"When Bharat heard Sumantra rede,To his fair words the prince agreed:\"Go quickly forth,\" he cried, \"and bringBefore my face the aged king.\"King Guha, with his kinsmen near,Rejoiced the summoning to hear:He nearer drew, bowed low his head,And thus to royal Bharat said:\"No mansions can our country boast,And unexpected comes thy host:But what we have I give thee all:Rest in the lodging of thy thrall.See, the Nishádas here have broughtThe fruit and roots their hands have sought:And we have woodland fare beside,And store of meat both fresh and dried.To rest their weary limbs, I prayThis night at least thy host may stay:Then cheered with all we can bestowTo-morrow thou with it mayst go.\"Canto LXXXV. Guha And Bharat.Thus the Nishádas\\' king besought:The prince with spirit wisdom-fraughtReplied in seemly words that blentDeep matter with the argument:\"Thou, friend of him whom I revere,With honours high hast met me here,For thou alone wouldst entertainAnd feed to-day so vast a train.\"In such fair words the prince replied,Then, pointing to the path he cried:\"Which way aright will lead my feetTo Bharadvája calm retreat;For all this land near Gangá streamsPathless and hard to traverse seems?\"Thus spoke the prince: King Guha heardDelighted every prudent word,And gazing on that forest wide,Raised suppliant hands, and thus replied:\"My servants, all the ground who know,O glorious Prince, with thee shall goWith constant care thy way to guide,And I will journey by thy side.But this thy host so wide dispreadWakes in my heart one doubt and dread,Lest, threatening Ráma good and great,Ill thoughts thy journey stimulate.\"But when King Guha, ill at ease,Declared his fear in words like these,As pure as is the cloudless skyWith soft voice Bharat made reply:\"Suspect me not: ne\\'er come the timeFor me to plot so foul a crime!He is my eldest brother, heIs like a father dear to me.I go to lead my brother thenceWho makes the wood his residence.No thought but this thy heart should frame:This simple truth my lips proclaim.\"Then with glad cheer King Guha cried,With Bharat answer gratified:\"Blessed art thou: on earth I seeNone who may vie, O Prince, with thee,Who canst of thy free will resignThe kingdom which unsought is thine.For this, a name that ne\\'er shall die,Thy glory through the worlds shall fly,Who fain wouldst balm thy brother painAnd lead the exile home again.\"As Guha thus, and Bharat, eachTo other spoke in friendly speech,The Day-God sank with glory dead,And night o\\'er all the sky was spread.Soon as King Guha thoughtful careHad quartered all the army there,Well honoured, Bharat laid his headBeside Satrughna on a bed.But grief for Ráma yet oppressedHigh-minded Bharat faithful breast--Such torment little was deservedBy him who ne\\'er from duty swerved.The fever raged through every veinAnd burnt him with its inward pain:So when in woods the flames leap freeThe fire within consumes the tree.From heat of burning anguish sprungThe sweat upon his body hung,As when the sun with fervid glowOn high Himálaya melts the snow.As, banished from the herd, a bullWanders alone and sorrowful.Thus sighing and distressed,In misery and bitter grief,With fevered heart that mocked relief,Distracted in his mind, the chiefStill mourned and found no rest.Canto LXXXVI. Guha Speech.Guha the king, acquainted wellWith all that in the wood befell,To Bharat the unequalled toldThe tale of Lakshman mighty-souled:\"With many an earnest word I spakeTo Lakshman as he stayed awake,And with his bow and shaft in handTo guard his brother kept his stand:\"Now sleep a little, Lakshman, seeThis pleasant bed is strewn for thee:Hereon thy weary body lay,And strengthen thee with rest, I pray,Inured to toil are men like these,But thou hast aye been nursed in ease.Rest, duteous-minded! I will keepMy watch while Ráma lies asleep:For in the whole wide world is noneDearer to me than Raghu son.Harbour no doubt or jealous fear:I speak the truth with heart sincere:For from the grace which he has shownWill glory on my name be thrown:Great store of merit shall I gain,And duteous, form no wish in vain.Let me enforced by many a rowOf followers, armed with shaft and bowFor well-loved Ráma weal provideWho lies asleep by Sítá side.For through this wood I often go,And all its shades conceal I know:And we with conquering arms can meetA four-fold host arrayed complete.\"\"With words like these I spoke, designedTo move the high-souled Bharat mind,But he upon his duty bent,Plied his persuasive argument:\"O, how can slumber close mine eyesWhen lowly couched with Sítá liesThe royal Ráma? can I giveMy heart to joy, or even live?He whom no mighty demon, no,Nor heavenly God can overthrow,See, Guha, how he lies, alas,With Sítá couched on gathered grass.By varied labours, long, severe,By many a prayer and rite austere,He, Dasaratha cherished son,By Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.Now as his son is forced to fly,The king ere long will surely die:Reft of his guardian hand, forlornIn widowed grief this land will mourn.E\\'en now perhaps, with toil o\\'erspent,The women cease their loud lament,And cries of woe no longer ringThroughout the palace of the king.But ah for sad Kausalyá! howFare she and mine own mother now?How fares the king? this night, I think,Some of the three in death will sink.With hopes upon Satrughna setMy mother may survive as yet,But the sad queen will die who boreThe hero, for her grief is sore.His cherished wish that would have madeDear Ráma king, so long delayed,\"Too late! too late!\" the king will cry,And conquered by his misery die.When Fate has brought the mournful dayWhich sees my father pass away,How happy in their lives are theyAllowed his funeral rites to pay.Our exile o\\'er, with him who ne\\'erTurns from the oath his lips may swear,May we returning safe and wellgain in fair Ayodhyá dwell.\"Thus Bharat stood with many a sighLamenting, and the night went by.Soon as the morning light shone fairIn votive coils both bound their hair.And then I sent them safely o\\'erAnd left them on the farther shore.With Sítá then they onward passed,Their coats of bark about them cast,Their locks like hermits\\' bound,The mighty tamers of the foe,Each with his arrows and his bow,Went over the rugged ground,Proud in their strength and undeterredLike elephants that lead the herd,And gazing oft around.\"Canto LXXXVII. Guha Story.That speech of Guha Bharat heardWith grief and tender pity stirred,And as his ears the story drank,Deep in his thoughtful heart it sank.His large full eyes in anguish rolled,His trembling limbs grew stiff and cold;Then fell he, like a tree uptorn,In woe too grievous to be borne.When Guha saw the long-armed chiefWhose eye was like a lotus leaf,With lion shoulders strong and fair,High-mettled, prostrate in despair,--Pale, bitterly afflicted, heReeled as in earthquake reels a tree.But when Satrughna standing nighSaw his dear brother helpless lie,Distraught with woe his head he bowed,Embraced him oft and wept aloud.Then Bharat mothers came, forlornOf their dear king, with fasting worn,And stood with weeping eyes aroundThe hero prostrate on the ground.Kausalyá, by her woe oppressed,The senseless Bharat limbs caressed,As a fond cow in love and fearCaresses oft her youngling dear:Then yielding to her woe she said,Weeping and sore disquieted:\"What torments, O my son, are theseOf sudden pain or swift disease?The lives of us and all the lineDepend, dear child, on only thine.Ráma and Lakshman forced to flee,I live by naught but seeing thee:For as the king has past awayThou art my only help to-day.Hast thou, perchance, heard evil newsOf Lakshman, which thy soul subdues,Or Ráma dwelling with his spouse--My all is he--neath forest boughs?\"Then slowly gathering sense and strengthThe weeping hero rose at length,And words like these to Guha spake,That bade Kausalyá comfort take:\"Where lodged the prince that night? and whereLakshman the brave, and Sítá fair?Show me the couch whereon he lay,Tell me the food he ate, I pray.\"Then Guha the Nishádas\\' kingReplied to Bharat questioning:\"Of all I had I brought the bestTo serve my good and honoured guestFood of each varied kind I chose,And every fairest fruit that grows.Ráma the hero truly braveDeclined the gift I humbly gave:His Warrior part he ne\\'er forgot,And what I brought accepted not:\"No gifts, my friend, may we accept:Our law is, Give, and must be kept.\"The high-souled chief, O Monarch, thusWith gracious words persuaded us.Then calm and still, absorbed in thought,He drank the water Lakshman brought,And then, obedient to his vows,He fasted with his gentle spouse.So Lakshman too from food abstained,And sipped the water that remained:Then with ruled lips, devoutly staid,The three(362) their evening worship paid.Then Lakshman with unwearied careBrought heaps of sacred grass, and thereWith his own hands he quickly spread,For Ráma rest, a pleasant bed,And faithful Sítá too, where theyReclining each by other lay.Then Lakshman bathed their feet, and drewA little distance from the two.Here stands the tree which lent them shade,Here is the grass beneath it laid,Where Ráma and his consort spentThe night together ere they went.Lakshman, whose arms the foeman quell,Watched all the night as sentinel,And kept his great bow strung:His hand was gloved, his arm was braced,Two well-filled quivers at his waist,With deadly arrows, hung.I took my shafts and trusty bow,And with that tamer of the foeStood ever wakeful near,And with my followers, bow in hand,Behind me ranged, a ready band,Kept watch o\\'er Indra peer.\"Canto LXXXVIII. The Ingudí Tree.When Bharat with each friend and peerHad heard that tale so full and clear,They went together to the treeThe bed which Ráma pressed to see.Then Bharat to his mothers said:\"Behold the high-souled hero bed:These tumbled heaps of grass betrayWhere he that night with Sítá lay:Unmeet, the heir of fortune highThus on the cold bare earth should lie,The monarch son, in counsel sage,Of old imperial lineage.That lion-lord whose noble bedWith finest skins of deer was spread,--How can he now endure to pressThe bare earth, cold and comfortless!This sudden fall from bliss to griefAppears untrue, beyond belief:My senses are distraught: I seemTo view the fancies of a dream.There is no deity so great,No power in heaven can master Fate,If Ráma, Dasaratha heir,Lay on the ground and slumbered there;And lovely Sítá, she who springsFrom fair Videha ancient kings,Ráma dear wife, by all adored,Lay on the earth beside her lord.Here was his couch, upon this heapHe tossed and turned in restless sleep:On the hard soil each manly limbHas stamped the grass with signs of him.That night, it seems, fair Sítá spentArrayed in every ornament,For here and there my eyes beholdSmall particles of glistering gold.She laid her outer garment here,For still some silken threads appear,How dear in her devoted eyesMust be the bed where Ráma lies,Where she so tender could reposeAnd by his side forget her woes.Alas, unhappy, guilty me!For whom the prince was forced to flee,And chief of Raghu sons and best,A bed like this with Sítá pressed.Son of a royal sire whose handRuled paramount o\\'er every land,Could he who every joy bestows,Whose body like the lotus shows,The friend of all, who charms the sight,Whose flashing eyes are darkly bright,Leave the dear kingdom, his by right,Unmeet for woe, the heir of bliss,And lie upon a bed like this?Great joy and happy fate are thine,O Lakshman, marked with each fair sign,Whose faithful footsteps follow stillThy brother in his hour of ill.And blest is Sítá, nobly good,Who dwells with Ráma in the wood.Ours is, alas, a doubtful fateOf Ráma reft and desolate.My royal sire has gained the skies,In woods the high-souled hero lies;The state is wrecked and tempest-tossed,A vessel with her rudder lost.Yet none in secret thought has plannedWith hostile might to seize the land:Though forced in distant wilds to dwell,The hero arm protects it well.Unguarded, with deserted wall,No elephant or steed in stall,My father royal city showsHer portals open to her foes,Of bold protectors reft and bare,Defenceless in her dark despair:But still her foes the wish restrain,As men from poisoned cates refrain.I from this hour my nights will passCouched on the earth or gathered grass,Eat only fruit and roots, and wearA coat of bark, and matted hair.I in the woods will pass, content,For him the term of banishment;So shall I still unbroken saveThe promise which the hero gave.While I remain for Ráma there,Satrughna will my exile share,And Ráma in his home again,With Lakshman, o\\'er Ayodhyá reign,for him, to rule and guard the state,The twice-born men shall consecrate.O, may the Gods I serve inclineTo grant this earnest wish of mine!If when I bow before his feetAnd with all moving arts entreat,He still deny my prayer,Then with my brother will I live:He must, he must permission give,Roaming in forests there.\"Canto LXXXIX. The Passage Of Gangá.That night the son of Raghu layOn Gangá bank till break of day:Then with the earliest light he wokeAnd thus to brave Satrughna spoke.\"Rise up, Satrughna, from thy bed:Why sleepest thou the night is fled.See how the sun who chases nightWakes every lotus with his light.Arise, arise, and first of allThe lord of Sringavera call,For he his friendly aid will lendOur army o\\'er the flood to send.\"Thus urged, Satrughna answered: \"I,Remembering Ráma, sleepless lie.\"As thus the brothers, each to each,The lion-mettled, ended speech,Came Guha, the Nishádas\\' king,And spoke with kindly questioning:\"Hast thou in comfort passed,\" he cried,\"The night upon the river side?With thee how fares it? and are these,Thy soldiers, healthy and at ease?\"Thus the Nishádas\\' lord inquiredIn gentle words which love inspired,And Bharat, Ráma faithful slave,Thus to the king his answer gave:\"The night has sweetly passed, and weAre highly honoured, King, by thee.Now let thy servants boats prepare,Our army o\\'er the stream to bear.\"The speech of Bharat Guha heard,And swift to do his bidding stirred.Within the town the monarch spedAnd to his ready kinsmen said:\"Awake, each kinsman, rise, each friend!May every joy your lives attend.Gather each boat upon the shoreAnd ferry all the army o\\'er.\"Thus Guha spoke: nor they delayed,But, rising quick, their lord obeyed,And soon, from every side secured,Five hundred boats were ready moored.Some reared aloft the mystic sign,(363)And mighty bells were hung in line:Of firmest build, gay flags they bore,And sailors for the helm and oar.One such King Guha chose, whereon,Of fair white cloth, an awning shone,And sweet musicians charmed the ear,--And bade his servants urge it near.Then Bharat swiftly sprang on board,And then Satrughna, famous lord,To whom, with many a royal dame,Kausalyá and Sumitrá came.The household priest went first in place,The elders, and the Bráhman race,And after them the monarch trainOf women borne in many a wain.Then high to heaven the shouts of thoseWho fired the army huts,(364) arose,With theirs who bathed along the shore,Or to the boats the baggage bore.Full freighted with that mighty forceThe boats sped swiftly on their course,By royal Guha servants manned,And gentle gales the banners fanned.Some boats a crowd of dames conveyed,In others noble coursers neighed;Some chariots and their cattle bore,Some precious wealth and golden store.Across the stream each boat was rowed,There duly disembarked its load,And then returning on its way,Sped here and there in merry play.Then swimming elephants appearedWith flying pennons high upreared.And as the drivers urged them o\\'er,The look of winged mountains wore.Some men in barges reached the strand,Others on rafts came safe to land:Some buoyed with pitchers crossed the tide,And others on their arms relied.Thus with the help the monarch gaveThe army crossed pure Gangá wave:Then in auspicious hour it stoodWithin Prayága famous wood.The prince with cheering words addressedHis weary men, and bade them restWhere\\'er they chose and he,With priest and deacon by his side,To Bharadvája dwelling hiedThat best of saints to see.Canto XC. The Hermitage.The prince of men a league awaySaw where the hermit dwelling lay,Then with his lords his path pursued,And left his warrior multitude.On foot, as duty taught his mind,He left his warlike gear behind;Two robes of linen cloth he wore,And bade Vasishtha walk before.Then Bharat from his lords withdrewWhen Bharadvája came in view,And toward the holy hermit wentBehind Vasishtha, reverent.When Bharadvája, saint austere,Saw good Vasishtha drawing near,He cried, upspringing from his seat,\"The grace-gift bring, my friend to greet.\"When Saint Vasishtha near him drew,And Bharat paid the reverence due,The glorious hermit was awareThat Dasaratha son was there.The grace-gift, water for their feetHe gave, and offered fruit to eat;Then, duty-skilled, with friendly speechIn seemly order questioned each:\"How fares it in Ayodhyá nowWith treasury and army? howWith kith and kin and friends most dear,With councillor, and prince, and peer?\"But, for he knew the king was dead,Of Dasaratha naught he said.Vasishtha and the prince in turnWould of the hermit welfare learn:Of holy fires they fain would hear,Of pupils, trees, and birds, and deer.The glorious saint his answer madeThat all was well in holy shade:Then love of Ráma moved his breast,And thus he questioned of his guest:\"Why art thou here, O Prince, whose bandWith kingly sway protects the land?Declare the cause, explain the whole,For yet some doubt disturbs my soul.He whom Kausalyá bare, whose mightThe foemen slays, his line delight,He who with wife and brother sentAfar now roam in banishment,Famed prince, to whom his father spakeThis order for a woman sake:\"Away! and in the forest spendThy life till fourteen years shall end\"--Has thou the wish to harm him, bentOn sin against the innocent?Wouldst thou thine elder realm enjoyWithout a thorn that can annoy?\"With sobbing voice and tearful eyeThus Bharat sadly made reply:\"Ah lost am I, if thou, O Saint,Canst thus in thought my heart attaint:No warning charge from thee I need;Ne\\'er could such crime from me proceed.The words my guilty mother spakeWhen fondly jealous for my sake--Think not that I, to triumph moved,Those words approve or e\\'er approved.O Hermit, I have sought this placeTo win the lordly hero grace,To throw me at my brother feetAnd lead him to his royal seat.To this, my journey aim and end,Thou shouldst, O Saint, thy favour lend:Where is the lord of earth? do thou,Most holy, say, where roams he now?\"Then, by the saint Vasishtha pressed,And all the gathered priests beside,To Bharat dutiful requestThe hermit graciously replied:\"Worthy of thee, O Prince, this deed,True son of Raghu ancient seed.I know thee reverent, well-controlled,The glory of the good of old.I grant thy prayer: in this pursuitI know thy heart is resolute.\\'Tis for thy sake those words I saidThat wider still thy fame may spread.I know where Ráma, duty-tried,His brother, and his wife abide.Where Chitrakúta heights ariseThy brother Ráma dwelling lies.Go thither with the morning light,And stay with all thy lords tonight:For I would show thee honour high,And do not thou my wish deny.\"Canto XCI. Bharadvája Feast.Soon as he saw the prince mindTo rest that day was well inclined,He sought Kaikeyí son to pleaseWith hospitable courtesies.Then Bharat to the saint replied:\"Our wants are more than satisfied.The gifts which honoured strangers greet,And water for our weary feetHast thou bestowed with friendly care,And every choice of woodland fare.\"Then Bharadvája spoke, a smilePlaying upon his lips the while:\"I know, dear Prince, thy friendly mindWill any fare sufficient find,But gladly would I entertainAnd banquet all thine armed train:Such is my earnest wish: do thouThis longing of my heart allow,Why hast thou hither bent thy way,And made thy troops behind thee stay?Why unattended? couldst thou notWith friends and army seek this spot?\"Bharat, with reverent hands raised high,To that great hermit made reply:\"My troops, for awe of thee, O Sage,I brought not to thy hermitage:Troops of a king or monarch sonA hermit home should ever shun.Behind me comes a mighty trainWide spreading o\\'er the ample plain,Where every chief and captain leadsMen, elephants, and mettled steeds.I feared, O reverend Sage, lest theseMight harm the holy ground and trees,Springs might be marred and cots o\\'erthrown,So with the priests I came alone.\"\"Bring all thy host,\" the hermit cried,And Bharat, to his joy, complied.Then to the chapel went the sire,Where ever burnt the sacred fire,And first, in order due, with sipsOf water purified his lips:To Visvakarmá, then he prayed,His hospitable feast to aid:\"Let Visvakarmá hear my call,The God who forms and fashions all:A mighty banquet I provide,Be all my wants this day supplied.Lord Indra at their head, the three(365)Who guard the worlds I call to me:A mighty host this day I feed,Be now supplied my every need.Let all the streams that eastward go,And those whose waters westering flow,Both on the earth and in the sky,Flow hither and my wants supply.Be some with ardent liquor filled,And some with wine from flowers distilled,While some their fresh cool streams retainSweet as the juice of sugar-cane.I call the Gods, I call the bandOf minstrels that around them stand:I call the Háhá and Huhú,I call the sweet Visvávasu,I call the heavenly wives of theseWith all the bright Apsarases,Alambúshá of beauty rare,The charmer of the tangled hair,Ghritáchí and Visváchi fair,Hemá and Bhímá sweet to view,And lovely Nágadantá too,And all the sweetest nymphs who standBy Indra or by Brahmá hand--I summon these with all their trainAnd Tumburu to lead the strain.Here let Kuvera garden riseWhich far in Northern Kuru(366) lies:For leaves let cloth and gems entwine,And let its fruit be nymphs divine.Let Soma(367) give the noblest foodTo feed the mighty multitude,Of every kind, for tooth and lip,To chew, to lick, to suck, and sip.Let wreaths, where fairest flowers abound,Spring from the trees that bloom around.Each sort of wine to woo the taste,And meats of every kind be placed.\"Thus spake the hermit self-restrained,With proper tone by rules ordained,On deepest meditation bent,In holy might preëminent.Then as with hands in reverence raisedAbsorbed in thought he eastward gazed,The deities he thus addressedCame each in semblance manifest.Delicious gales that cooled the frameFrom Malaya and Dardar came,That kissed those scented hills and threwAuspicious fragrance where they blew.Then falling fast in sweetest showersCame from the sky immortal flowers,And all the airy region roundWith heavenly drums was made to sound.Then breathed a soft celestial breeze,Then danced the bright Apsarases,The minstrels and the Gods advanced,And warbling lutes the soul entranced.The earth and sky that music filled,And through each ear it softly thrilled,As from the heavenly quills it fellWith time and tune attempered well.Soon as the minstrels ceased to playAnd airs celestial died away,The troops of Bharat saw amazedWhat Visvakarmá art had raised.On every side, five leagues around,All smooth and level lay the ground,With fresh green grass that charmed the sightLike sapphires blent with lazulite.There the Wood-apple hung its load,The Mango and the Citron glowed,The Bel and scented Jak were there,And Apelá with fruitage fair.There, brought from Northern Kuru, stoodRich in delights, the glorious wood,And many a stream was seen to glideWith flowering trees along its side.There mansions rose with four wide halls,And elephants and chargers\\' stalls,And many a house of royal state,Triumphal arc and bannered gate.With noble doorways, sought the sky,Like a pale cloud, a palace high,Which far and wide rare fragrance shed,With wreaths of white engarlanded.Square was its shape, its halls were wide,With many a seat and couch supplied,Drink of all kinds, and every meatSuch as celestial Gods might eat.Then at the bidding of the seerKaikeyí strong-armed son drew near,And passed within that fair abodeWhich with the noblest jewels glowed.Then, as Vasishtha led the way,The councillors, in due array,Followed delighted and amazedAnd on the glorious structure gazed.Then Bharat, Raghu son, drew nearThe kingly throne, with prince and peer,Whereby the chouri in the shadeOf the white canopy was laid.Before the throne he humbly bentAnd honoured Ráma, reverent,Then in his hand the chouri bore,And sat where sits a councillor.His ministers and household priestSat by degrees from chief to least,Then sat the captain of the hostAnd all the men he honoured most.Then when the saint his order gave,Each river with enchanted waveRolled milk and curds divinely sweetBefore the princely Bharat feet;And dwellings fair on either side,With gay white plaster beautified,Their heavenly roofs were seen to lift,The Bráhman Bharadvája gift.Then straight by Lord Kuvera sent,Gay with celestial ornamentOf bright attire and jewels\\' shine,Came twenty thousand nymphs divine:The man on whom those beauties glancedThat moment felt his soul entranced.With them from Nandan blissful shadesCame twenty thousand heavenly maids.Tumburu, Nárad, Gopa came,And Sutanu, like radiant flame,The kings of the Gandharva throng,And ravished Bharat with their song.Then spoke the saint, and swift obeyedAlambúshá, the fairest maid,And Misrakesí bright to view,Ramaná, Pundríká too,And danced to him with graceful easeThe dances of Apsarases.All chaplets that by Gods are worn,Or Chaitraratha graves adorn,Bloomed by the saint command arrayedOn branches in Prayága shade.When at the saint command the breezeMade music with the Vilva trees,To wave in rhythmic beat beganThe boughs of each Myrobolan,And holy fig-trees wore the lookOf dancers, as their leaflets shook.The fair Tamála, palm, and pine,With trees that tower and plants that twine,The sweetly varying forms displayedOf stately dame or bending maid.Here men the foaming winecup quaffed,Here drank of milk full many a draught,And tasted meats of every kind,Well dressed, whatever pleased their mind.Then beauteous women, seven or eight,Stood ready by each man to wait:Beside the stream his limbs they strippedAnd in the cooling water dipped.And then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,With soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried,And sitting on the lovely bankHeld up the winecup as he drank.Nor did the grooms forget to feedCamel and mule and ox and steed,For there were stores of roasted grain,Of honey and of sugar-cane.So fast the wild excitement spreadAmong the warriors Bharat led,That all the mighty army throughThe groom no more his charger knew,And he who drove might seek in vainTo tell his elephant again.With every joy and rapture fired,Entranced with all the heart desired,The myriads of the host that nightRevelled delirious with delight.Urged by the damsels at their sideIn wild delight the warriors cried:\"Ne\\'er will we seek Ayodhyá, no,Nor yet to Dandak forest go:Here will we stay: may happy fateOn Bharat and on Ráma wait.\"Thus cried the army gay and freeExulting in their lawless glee,Both infantry and those who rodeOn elephants, or steeds bestrode,Ten thousand voices shouting, \"ThisIs heaven indeed for perfect bliss.\"With garlands decked they idly strayed,And danced and laughed and sang and played.At length as every soldier eyed,With food like Amrit satisfied,Each dainty cate and tempting meat,No longer had he care to eat.Thus soldier, servant, dame, and slaveReceived whate\\'er the wish might crave.As each in new-wrought clothes arrayedEnjoyed the feast before him laid.Each man was seen in white attireUnstained by spot or speck of mire:None was athirst or hungry there,And none had dust upon his hair.On every side in woody dellsWas milky food in bubbling wells,And there were all-supplying cowsAnd honey dropping from the boughs.Nor wanted lakes of flower-made drinkWith piles of meat upon the brink,Boiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,Peachick and jungle-fowl and deer,There was the flesh of kid and boar,And dainty sauce in endless store,With juice of flowers concocted well,And soup that charmed the taste and smell,And pounded fruits of bitter taste,And many a bath was ready placedDown by each river shelving sideThere stood great basins well supplied,And laid therein, of dazzling sheen,White brushes for the teeth were seen,And many a covered box whereinWas sandal powdered for the skin.And mirrors bright with constant care,And piles of new attire were there,And store of sandals and of shoes,Thousands of pairs, for all to choose:Eye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,Umbrellas fair and bows appeared.Lakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid,(368)And some for pleasant bathing made,With waters fair, and smooth inclineFor camels, horses, mules, and kine.There saw they barley heaped on highThe countless cattle to supply:The golden grain shone fair and brightAs sapphires or the lazulite.To all the gathered host it seemedAs if that magic scene they dreamed,And wonder, as they gazed, increasedAt Bharadvája glorious feast.Thus in the hermit grove they spentThat night in joy and merriment,Blest as the Gods who take their easeUnder the shade of Nandan trees.Each minstrel bade the saint adieu,And to his blissful mansion flew,And every stream and heavenly dameReturned as swiftly as she came.Canto XCII. Bharat Farewell.So Bharat with his army spentThe watches of the night content,And gladly, with the morning lightDrew near his host the anchorite.When Bharadvája saw him standWith hand in reverence joined to hand,When fires of worship had been fed,He looked upon the prince and said:\"O blameless son, I pray thee tell,Did the past night content thee well?Say if the feast my care suppliedThy host of followers gratified.\"His hands he joined, his head he bentAnd spoke in answer reverentTo the most high and radiant sageWho issued from his hermitage:\"Well have I passed the night: thy feastGave joy to every man and beast;And I, great lord, and every peerWere satisfied with sumptuous cheer,Thy banquet has delighted allFrom highest chief to meanest thrall,And rich attire and drink and meatBanished the thought of toil and heat.And now, O Hermit good and great,A boon of thee I supplicate.To Ráma side my steps I bend:Do thou with friendly eye commend.O tell me how to guide my feetTo virtuous Ráma lone retreat:Great Hermit, I entreat thee, sayHow far from here and which the way.\"Thus by fraternal love inspiredThe chieftain of the saint inquired:Then thus replied the glorious seerOf matchless might, of vows austere:\"Ere the fourth league from here be passed,Amid a forest wild and vast,Stands Chitrakúta mountain tall,Lovely with wood and waterfall.North of the mountain thou wilt seeThe beauteous stream Mandákiní,Where swarm the waterfowl below,And gay trees on the margin grow.Then will a leafy cot betweenThe river and the hill be seen:\\'Tis Ráma, and the princely pairOf brothers live for certain there.Hence to the south thine army lead,And then more southward still proceed,So shalt thou find his lone retreat,And there the son of Raghu meet.\"Soon as the ordered march they knew,The widows of the monarch flew,Leaving their cars, most meet to ride,And flocked to Bharadvája side.There with the good Sumitrá QueenKausalyá, sad and worn, was seen,Caressing, still with sorrow faint,The feet of that illustrious saint,Kaikeyí too, her longings crossed,Reproached of all, her object lost,Before the famous hermit came,And clasped his feet, o\\'erwhelmed with shame.With circling steps she humbly wentAround the saint preëminent,And stood not far from Bharat sideWith heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.Then the great seer, who never brokeOne holy vow, to Bharat spoke:\"Speak, Raghu son: I fain would learnThe story of each queen in turn.\"Obedient to the high requestBy Bharadvája thus addressed,His reverent hands together laid,He, skilled in speech, his answer made:\"She whom, O Saint, thou seest hereA Goddess in her form appear,Was the chief consort of the king,Now worn with fast and sorrowing.As Aditi in days of yoreThe all-preserving Vishnu bore,Kausalyá bore with happy fateLord Ráma of the lion gait.She who, transfixed with torturing pangs,On her left arm so fondly hangs,As when her withering leaves decayDroops by the wood the Cassia spray,Sumitrá, pained with woe, is she,The consort second of the three:Two princely sons the lady bare,Fair as the Gods in heaven are fair.And she, the wicked dame through whomMy brothers\\' lives are wrapped in gloom,And mourning for his offspring dear,The king has sought his heavenly sphere,--Proud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,Self-fancied darling of my sire,Kaikeyí, most ambitious queen,Unlovely with her lovely mien,My mother she, whose impious willIs ever bent on deeds of ill,In whom the root and spring I seeOf all this woe which crushes me.\"Quick breathing like a furious snake,With tears and sobs the hero spake,With reddened eyes aglow with rage.And Bharadvája, mighty sage,Supreme in wisdom, calm and grave,In words like these good counsel gave:\"O Bharat, hear the words I say;On her the fault thou must not lay:For many a blessing yet will springFrom banished Ráma wandering.\"And Bharat, with that promise cheered,Went circling round that saint revered,He humbly bade farewell, and thenGave orders to collect his men.Prompt at the summons thousands flewTo cars which noble coursers drew,Bright-gleaming, glorious to behold,Adorned with wealth of burnished gold.Then female elephants and male,Gold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,Marched with their bright bells\\' tinkling chimeLike clouds when ends the summer time:Some cars were huge and some were light,For heavy draught or rapid flight,Of costly price, of every kind,With clouds of infantry behind.The dames, Kausalyá at their head,Were in the noblest chariots led,And every gentle bosom beatWith hope the banished prince to meet.The royal Bharat, glory-crowned,With all his retinue around,Borne in a beauteous litter rode,Like the young moon and sun that glowed.The army as it streamed along,Cars, elephants, in endless throng,Showed, marching on its southward way,Like autumn clouds in long array.Canto XCIII. Chitrakúta In Sight.As through the woods its way pursuedThat mighty bannered multitude,Wild elephants in terror fledWith all the startled herds they led,And bears and deer were seen on hill,In forest glade, by every rill.Wide as the sea from coast to coast,The high-souled Bharat mighty hostCovered the earth as cloudy trainsObscure the sky when fall the rains.The stately elephants he led,And countless steeds the land o\\'erspread,So closely crowded that betweenTheir serried ranks no ground was seen.Then when the host had travelled far,And steeds were worn who drew the car,The glorious Bharat thus addressedVasishtha, of his lords the best:\"The spot, methinks, we now beholdOf which the holy hermit told,For, as his words described, I traceEach several feature of the place:Before us Chitrakúta shows,Mandákiní beside us flows:Afar umbrageous woods ariseLike darksome clouds that veil the skies.Now tread these mountain-beasts of mineOn Chitrakúta fair incline.The trees their rain of blossoms shedOn table-lands beneath them spread,As from black clouds the floods descendWhen the hot days of summer end.Satrughna, look, the mountain seeWhere heavenly minstrels wander free,And horses browse beneath the steep,Countless as monsters in the deep.Scared by my host the mountain deerStarting with tempest speed appearLike the long lines of cloud that flyIn autumn through the windy sky.See, every warrior shows his headWith fragrant blooms engarlanded;All look like southern soldiers whoLift up their shields of azure hue.This lonely wood beneath the hill,That was so dark and drear and still,Covered with men in endless streamsNow like Ayodhyá city seems.The dust which countless hoofs exciteObscures the sky and veils the light;But see, swift winds those clouds dispelAs if they strove to please me well.See, guided in their swift careerBy many a skilful charioteer,Those cars by fleetest coursers drawnRace onward over glade and lawn.Look, startled as the host comes nearThe lovely peacocks fly in fear,Gorgeous as if the fairest bloomsOf earth had glorified their plumes.Look where the sheltering covert showsThe trooping deer, both bucks and does,That occupy in countless herdsThis mountain populous with birds.Most lovely to my mind appearsThis place which every charm endears:Fair as the road where tread the Blest;Here holy hermits take their rest.Then let the army onward pressAnd duly search each green recessFor the two lion-lords, till weRáma once more and Lakshman see.\"Thus Bharat spoke: and hero bandsOf men with weapons in their handsEntered the tangled forest: thenA spire of smoke appeared in ken.Soon as they saw the rising smokeTo Bharat they returned and spoke:\"No fire where men are not: \\'tis clearThat Raghu sons are dwelling here.Or if not here those heroes dwellWhose mighty arms their foeman quell,Still other hermits here must beLike Ráma, true and good as he.\"His ears attentive Bharat lentTo their resistless argument,Then to his troops the chief who brokeHis foe embattled armies spoke:\"Here let the troops in silence stay;One step beyond they must not stray.Come Dhrishti and Sumantra, youWith me alone the path pursue.\"Their leader speech the warriors heard,And from his place no soldier stirred,And Bharat bent his eager eyesWhere curling smoke was seen to rise.The host his order well obeyed,And halting there in silence stayedWatching where from the thicket shadeThey saw the smoke appear.And joy through all the army ran,\"Soon shall we meet,\" thought every man,\"The prince we hold so dear.\"Canto XCIV. Chitrakúta.There long the son of Raghu dweltAnd love for hill and wood he felt.Then his Videhan spouse to pleaseAnd his own heart of woe to ease,Like some Immortal--Indra soMight Swarga charms to Sachí show--Drew her sweet eyes to each delightOf Chitrakúta lovely height:\"Though reft of power and kingly sway,Though friends and home are far away,I cannot mourn my altered lot,Enamoured of this charming spot.Look, darling, on this noble hillWhich sweet birds with their music fill,Bright with a thousand metal dyesHis lofty summits cleave the skies.See, there a silvery sheen is spread,And there like blood the rocks are red.There shows a streak of emerald green,And pink and yellow glow between.There where the higher peaks ascend,Crystal and flowers and topaz blend,And others flash their light afarLike mercury or some fair star:With such a store of metals dyedThe king of hills is glorified.There through the wild birds\\' populous homeThe harmless bear and tiger roam:Hyćnas range the woody slopesWith herds of deer and antelopes.See, love, the trees that clothe his sideAll lovely in their summer pride,In richest wealth of leaves arrayed,With flower and fruit and light and shade,Look where the young Rose-apple glows;What loaded boughs the Mango shows;See, waving in the western windThe light leaves of the Tamarind,And mark that giant Peepul throughThe feathery clump of tall bamboo.(369)Look, on the level lands above,Delighting in successful loveIn sweet enjoyment many a pairOf heavenly minstrels revels there,While overhanging boughs supportTheir swords and mantles as they sport:Then see that pleasant shelter wherePlay the bright Daughters of the Air.(370)The mountain seems with bright cascadeAnd sweet rill bursting from the shade,Like some majestic elephant o\\'erWhose burning head the torrents pour.Where breathes the man who would not feelDelicious languor o\\'er him steal,As the young morning breeze that springsFrom the cool cave with balmy wings,Breathes round him laden with the scentOf bud and blossom dew-besprent?If many autumns here I spentWith thee, my darling innocent,And Lakshman, I should never knowThe torture of the fires of woe,This varied scene so charms my sight,This mount so fills me with delight,Where flowers in wild profusion spring,And ripe fruits glow and sweet birds sing.My beauteous one, a double goodSprings from my dwelling in the wood:Loosed is the bond my sire that tied,And Bharat too is gratified.My darling, dost thou feel with meDelight from every charm we see,Of which the mind and every senseFeel the enchanting influence?My fathers who have passed away,The royal saints, were wont to say,That life in woodland shades like thisSecures a king immortal bliss.See, round the hill at random thrown,Huge masses lie of rugged stoneOf every shape and many a hue,Yellow and white and red and blue.But all is fairer still by night:Each rock reflects a softer light,When the whole mount from foot to crestIn robes of lambent flame is dressed;When from a million herbs a blazeOf their own luminous glory plays,And clothed in fire each deep ravine,Each pinnacle and crag is seen.Some parts the look of mansions wear,And others are as gardens fair,While others seem a massive blockOf solid undivided rock.Behold those pleasant beds o\\'erlaidWith lotus leaves, for lovers made,Where mountain birch and costus throwCool shadows on the pair below.See where the lovers in their playHave cast their flowery wreaths away,And fruit and lotus buds that crownedTheir brows lie trodden on the ground.North Kuru realm is fair to see,Vasvaukasárá,(371) Naliní,(372)But rich in fruit and blossom stillMore fair is Chitrakúta hill.Here shall the years appointed glideWith thee, my beauty, by my side,And Lakshman ever near;Here shall I live in all delight,Make my ancestral fame more bright,Tread in their path who walk aright,And to my oath adhere.\"Canto XCV. Mandákiní.Then Ráma, like the lotus eyed,Descended from the mountain side,And to the Maithil lady showedThe lovely stream that softly flowed.And thus Ayodhyá lord addressedHis bride, of dames the loveliest,Child of Videha king, her faceBright with the fair moon tender grace:\"How sweetly glides, O darling, look,Mandákiní delightful brook,Adorned with islets, blossoms gay,And sárases and swans at play!The trees with which her banks are linedShow flowers and fruit of every kind:The match in radiant sheen is sheOf King Kuvera Naliní.(373)My heart exults with pleasure newThe shelving band and ford to view,Where gathering herds of thirsty deerDisturb the wave that ran so clear.Now look, those holy hermits markIn skins of deer and coats of bark;With twisted coils of matted hair,The reverend men are bathing there,And as they lift their arms on highThe Lord of Day they glorify:These best of saints, my large-eyed spouse,Are constant to their sacred vows.The mountain dances while the treesBend their proud summits to the breeze,And scatter many a flower and budFrom branches that o\\'erhang the flood.There flows the stream like lucid pearl,Round islets here the currents whirl,And perfect saints from middle airAre flocking to the waters there.See, there lie flowers in many a heapFrom boughs the whistling breezes sweep,And others wafted by the galeDown the swift current dance and sail.Now see that pair of wild-fowl rise,Exulting with their joyful cries:Hark, darling, wafted from afarHow soft their pleasant voices are.To gaze on Chitrakúta hill,To look upon this lovely rill,To bend mine eyes on thee, dear wife,Is sweeter than my city life.Come, bathe we in the pleasant rillWhose dancing waves are never still,Stirred by those beings pure from sin,The sanctities who bathe therein:Come, dearest, to the stream descend,Approach her as a darling friend,And dip thee in the silver floodWhich lotuses and lilies stud.Let this fair hill Ayodhyá seem,Its silvan things her people deem,And let these waters as they flowOur own beloved Sarjú show.How blest, mine own dear love, am I;Thou, fond and true, art ever nigh,And duteous, faithful Lakshman staysBeside me, and my word obeys.Here every day I bathe me thrice,Fruit, honey, roots for food suffice,And ne\\'er my thoughts with longing strayTo distant home or royal sway.For who this charming brook can seeWhere herds of roedeer wander free,And on the flowery-wooded brinkApes, elephants, and lions drink,Nor feel all sorrow fly?\"Thus eloquently spoke the prideOf Raghu children to his bride,And wandered happy by her sideWhere Chitrakúta azure-dyedUprears his peaks on high.Canto XCVI. The Magic Shaft.(374)Thus Ráma showed to Janak childThe varied beauties of the wild,The hill, the brook and each fair spot,Then turned to seek their leafy cot.North of the mountain Ráma foundA cavern in the sloping ground,Charming to view, its floor was strownWith many a mass of ore and stone,In secret shadow far retiredWhere gay birds sang with joy inspired,And trees their graceful branches swayedWith loads of blossom downward weighed.Soon as he saw the cave which tookEach living heart and chained the look,Thus Ráma spoke to Sítá whoGazed wondering on the silvan view:\"Does this fair cave beneath the height,Videhan lady, charm thy sight?Then let us resting here a whileThe languor of the way beguile.That block of stone so smooth and squareWas set for thee to rest on there,And like a thriving Kesar treeThis flowery shrub o\\'ershadows thee.\"Thus Ráma spoke, and Janak child,By nature ever soft and mild,In tender words which love betrayedHer answer to the hero made:\"O pride of Raghu children, stillMy pleasure is to do thy will.Enough for me thy wish to know:Far hast thou wandered to and fro.\"Thus Sítá spake in gentle tone,And went obedient to the stone,Of perfect face and faultless limbPrepared to rest a while with him.And Ráma, as she thus replied,Turned to his spouse again and cried:\"Thou seest, love, this flowery shadeFor silvan creatures\\' pleasure made,How the gum streams from trees and plantsTorn by the tusks of elephants!Through all the forest clear and highResounds the shrill cicala cry.Hark how the kite above us moans,And calls her young in piteous tones;So may my hapless mother beStill mourning in her home for me.There mounted on that lofty SálThe loud Bhringráj(375) repeats his call:How sweetly now he tunes his throatResponsive to the Koďl note.Or else the bird that now has sungMay be himself the Koďl young,Linked with such winning sweetness areThe notes he pours irregular.See, round the blooming Mango clingsThat creeper with her tender rings,So in thy love, when none is near,Thine arms are thrown round me, my dear.\"Thus in his joy he cried; and she,Sweet speaker, on her lover knee,Of faultless limb and perfect face,Grew closer to her lord embrace.Reclining in her husband arms,A goddess in her wealth of charms,She filled his loving breast anewWith mighty joy that thrilled him through.His finger on the rock he laid,Which veins of sanguine ore displayed,And painted o\\'er his darling eyesThe holy sign in mineral dyes.Bright on her brow the metal layLike the young sun first gleaming ray,And showed her in her beauty fairAs the soft light of morning air.Then from the Kesar laden treeHe picked fair blossoms in his glee,And as he decked each lovely tress,His heart o\\'erflowed with happiness.So resting on that rocky seatA while they spent in pastime sweet,Then onward neath the shady boughsWent Ráma with his Maithil spouse.She roaming in the forest shadeWhere every kind of creature strayedObserved a monkey wandering near,And clung to Ráma arm in fear.The hero Ráma fondly lacedHis mighty arms around her waist,Consoled his beauty in her dread,And scared the Monkey till he fled.That holy mark of sanguine oreThat gleamed on Sítá brow before,Shone by that close embrace impressedUpon the hero ample chest.Then Sítá, when the beast who ledThe monkey troop, afar had fled,Laughed loudly in light-hearted gleeThat mark on Ráma chest to see.A clump of bright Asokas firedThe forest in their bloom attired:The restless blossoms as they gleamedA host of threatening monkeys seemed.Then Sítá thus to Ráma cried,As longingly the flowers she eyed:\"Pride of thy race, now let us goWhere those Asoka blossoms grow.\"He on his darling pleasure bentWith his fair goddess thither wentAnd roamed delighted through the woodWhere blossoming Asokas stood,As Siva with Queen Umá rovesThrough Himaván majestic groves.Bright with purpureal glow the pairOf happy lovers sported there,And each upon the other setA flower-inwoven coronet.There many a crown and chain they woveOf blooms from that Asoka grove,And in their graceful sport the twoFresh beauty o\\'er the mountain threw.The lover let his love surveyEach pleasant spot that round them lay,Then turned they to their green retreatWhere all was garnished, gay, and neat.By brotherly affection led,Sumitrá son to meet them sped,And showed the labours of the dayDone while his brother was away.There lay ten black-deer duly slainWith arrows pure of poison stain,Piled in a mighty heap to dry,With many another carcass nigh.And Lakshman brother saw, o\\'erjoyed,The work that had his hands employed,Then to his consort thus he cried:\"Now be the general gifts supplied.\"Then Sítá, fairest beauty, placedThe food for living things to taste,And set before the brothers meatAnd honey that the pair might eat.They ate the meal her hands supplied,Their lips with water purified:Then Janak daughter sat at lastAnd duly made her own repast.The other venison, to be dried,Piled up in heaps was set aside,And Ráma told his wife to stayAnd drive the flocking crows away.Her husband saw her much distressedBy one more bold than all the rest,Whose wings where\\'er he chose could fly,Now pierce the earth, now roam the sky.Then Ráma laughed to see her stirredTo anger by the plaguing bird:Proud of his love the beauteous dameWith burning rage was all aflame.Now here, now there, again, againShe chased the crow, but all in vain,Enraging her, so quick to strikeWith beak and wing and claw alike:Then how the proud lip quivered, howThe dark frown marked her angry brow!When Ráma saw her cheek aglowWith passion, he rebuked the crow.But bold in impudence the bird,With no respect for Ráma word,Fearless again at Sítá flew:Then Ráma wrath to fury grew.The hero of the mighty armSpoke o\\'er a shaft the mystic charm,Laid the dire weapon on his bowAnd launched it at the shameless crow.The bird, empowered by Gods to springThrough earth itself on rapid wing,Through the three worlds in terror fledStill followed by that arrow dread.Where\\'er he flew, now here now there,A cloud of weapons filled the air.Back to the high-souled prince he fledAnd bent at Ráma feet his head,And then, as Sítá looked, beganHis speech in accents of a man:\"O pardon, and for pity sakeSpare, Ráma, spare my life to take!Where\\'er I turn, where\\'er I flee,No shelter from this shaft I see.\"The chieftain heard the crow entreatHelpless and prostrate at his feet,And while soft pity moved his breast,With wisest speech the bird addressed:\"I took the troubled Sítá part,And furious anger filled my heart.Then on the string my arrow layCharmed with a spell thy life to slay.Thou seekest now my feet, to craveForgiveness and thy life to save.So shall thy prayer have due respect:The suppliant I must still protect.But ne\\'er in vain this dart may flee;Yield for thy life a part of thee,What portion of thy body, say,Shall this mine arrow rend away?Thus far, O bird, thus far aloneOn thee my pity may be shown.Forfeit a part thy life to buy:\\'Tis better so to live than die.\"Thus Ráma spoke: the bird of airPondered his speech with anxious care,And wisely deemed it good to giveOne of his eyes that he might live.To Raghu son he made reply:\"O Ráma, I will yield an eye.So let me in thy grace confideAnd live hereafter single-eyed.\"Then Ráma charged the shaft, and lo,Full in the eye it smote the crow.And the Videhan lady gazedUpon the ruined eye amazed.The crow to Ráma humbly bent,Then where his fancy led he went.Ráma with Lakshman by his sideWith needful work was occupied.Canto XCVII. Lakshman Anger.Thus Ráma showed his love the rillWhose waters ran beneath the hill,Then resting on his mountain seatRefreshed her with the choicest meat.So there reposed the happy two:Then Bharat army nearer drew:Rose to the skies a dusty cloud,The sound of trampling feet was loud.The swelling roar of marching menDrove the roused tiger from his den,And scared amain the serpent raceFlying to hole and hiding-place.The herds of deer in terror fled,The air was filled with birds o\\'erhead,The bear began to leave his tree,The monkey to the cave to flee.Wild elephants were all amazedAs though the wood around them blazed.The lion oped his ponderous jaw,The buffalo looked round in awe.The prince, who heard the deafening sound,And saw the silvan creatures roundFly wildly startled from their rest,The glorious Lakshman thus addressed:\"Sumitrá noble son most dear,Hark, Lakshman, what a roar I hear,The tumult of a coming crowd,Appalling, deafening, deep, and loud!The din that yet more fearful growsScares elephants and buffaloes,Or frightened by the lions, deerAre flying through the wood in fear.I fain would know who seeks this placeComes prince or monarch for the chase?Or does some mighty beast of preyFrighten the silvan herds away?\\'Tis hard to reach this mountain height,Yea, e\\'en for birds in airy flight.Then fain, O Lakshman, would I knowWhat cause disturbs the forest so.\"Lakshman in haste, the wood to view,Climbed a high Sál that near him grew,The forest all around he eyed,First gazing on the eastern side.Then northward when his eyes he bentHe saw a mighty armamentOf elephants, and cars, and horse,And men on foot, a mingled force,And banners waving in the breeze,And spoke to Ráma words like these:\"Quick, quick, my lord, put out the fire,Let Sítá to the cave retire.Thy coat of mail around thee throw,Prepare thine arrows and thy bow.\"In eager haste thus Lakshman cried,And Ráma, lion lord, replied:\"Still closer be the army scanned,And say who leads the warlike band.\"Lakshman his answer thus returned,As furious rage within him burned,Exciting him like kindled fireTo scorch the army in his ire:\"\\'Tis Bharat: he has made the throneBy consecrating rites his own:To gain the whole dominion thusHe comes in arms to slaughter us.I mark tree-high upon his carHis flagstaff of the Kovidár,(376)I see his glittering banner glance,I see his chivalry advance:I see his eager warriors shineOn elephants in lengthened line.Now grasp we each the shafts and bow,And higher up the mountain go.Or in this place, O hero, standWith weapons in each ready hand.Perhaps beneath our might may fallThis leader of the standard tall,And Bharat I this day may seeWho brought this mighty woe on thee,Sítá, and me, who drove awayMy brother from the royal sway.Bharat our foe at length is nigh,And by this hand shall surely die:Brother, I see no sin at allIf Bharat by my weapon fall.No fault is his who slays the foeWhose hand was first to strike the blow:With Bharat now the crime beginsWho against thee and duty sins.The queen athirst for royal swayWill see her darling son to-dayFall by this hand, like some fair treeStruck by an elephant, slain by me.Kaikeyí self shall perish tooWith kith and kin and retinue,And earth by my avenging deedShall from this mass of sin be freed.This day my wrath, too long restrained,Shall fall upon the foe, unchained,Mad as the kindled flame that speedsDestroying through the grass and reeds.This day mine arrows keen and fierceThe bodies of the foe shall pierce:The woods on Chitrakúta sideShall run with torrents crimson-dyed.The wandering beasts of prey shall feedOn heart-cleft elephant and steed,And drag to mountain caves awayThe bodies that my arrows slay.Doubt not that Bharat and his trainShall in this mighty wood be slain:So shall I pay the debt my bowAnd these my deadly arrows owe.\"Canto XCVIII. Lakshman Calmed.Then Ráma nobly calm allayedThe wrath that Lakshman bosom swayed:\"What need have we the sword to wield,To bend the bow or lift the shield,If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,Himself has sought this sheltering wood?I sware my father will to do,And if I now my brother slewWhat gain in kingship should I find,Despised and scorned by all mankind?Believe me, e\\'en as I would shrinkFrom poisoned meat or deadly drink,No power or treasure would I winBy fall of friend or kith or kin.Brother, believe the words I speak:For your dear sakes alone I seekDuty and pleasure, wealth and gain:A holy life, a happy reign.If royal sway my heart desires,My brothers\\' weal the wish inspires:Their bliss and safety is my care,By this uplifted bow I swear.\\'Twere not so hard for me to gainThis broad land girdled by the main,But even Indra royal mightShould ne\\'er be mine in duty spite.If any bliss my soul can seeDeprived of dear Satrughna, thee,And Bharat, may the flame destroyWith ashy gloom the selfish joy.Far dearer than this life of mine,Knowing the custom of our line,His heart with fond affection fraught,Bharat Ayodhyá town resoughtAnd hearing when he came that I,With thee and Sítá, forced to flyWith matted hair and hermit dressAm wandering in the wilderness.While grief his troubled senses storms,And tender love his bosom warms,From every thought of evil clear,Is come to meet his brother here.Some grievous words perchance he spokeKaikeyí anger to provoke,Then won the king, and comes to layBefore my feet the royal sway.Hither, methinks, in season dueComes Bharat for an interview,Nor in his secret heart has heOne evil thought \\'gainst thee or me.What has he done ere now, reflect!How failed in love or due respectTo make thee doubt his faith and layThis evil to his charge to-day?Thou shouldst not join with Bharat nameSo harsh a speech and idle blame.The blows thy tongue at Bharat deals,My sympathizing bosom feels.How, urged by stress of any ill,Should sons their father life-blood spill,Or brother slay in impious strifeA brother dearer than his life?If thou these cruel words hast saidBy strong desire of empire led,My brother Bharat will I prayTo give to thee the kingly sway.\"Give him the realm,\" my speech shall be,And Bharat will, methinks, agree.\"Thus spoke the prince whose chief delightWas duty, and to aid the right:And Lakshman keenly felt the blame,And shrank within himself for shame:And then his answer thus returned,With downcast eye and cheek that burned:\"Brother, I ween, to see thy faceOur sire himself has sought this place.\"Thus Lakshman spoke and stood ashamed,And Ráma saw and thus exclaimed:\"It is the strong-armed monarch: heIs come, methinks, his sons to see,To bid us both the forest quitFor joys for which he deems us fit:He thinks on all our care and pain,And now would lead us home again.My glorious father hence will bearSítá who claims all tender care.I see two coursers fleet as storms,Of noble breed and lovely forms.I see the beast of mountain sizeWho bears the king our father wise,The aged Victor, march this wayIn front of all the armed array.But doubt and fear within me rise,For when I look with eager eyesI see no white umbrella spread,World-famous, o\\'er the royal head.Now, Lakshman, from the tree descend,And to my words attention lend.\"Thus spoke the pious prince: and heDescended from the lofty tree,And reverent hand to hand applied,Stood humbly by his brother side.The host, compelled by Bharat care,The wood from trampling feet to spare,Dense crowding half a league each wayEncamped around the mountain lay.Below the tall hill shelving sideGleamed the bright army far and wideSpread o\\'er the ample space,By Bharat led who firmly trueIn duty from his bosom threwAll pride, and near his brother drewTo win the hero grace.Canto XCIX. Bharat Approach.Soon as the warriors took their restObeying Bharat high behest,Thus Bharat to Satrughna spake:\"A band of soldiers with thee take,And with these hunters o\\'er and o\\'erThe thickets of the wood explore.With bow, sword, arrows in their handsLet Guha with his kindred bandsWithin this grove remaining traceThe children of Kakutstha race.And I meanwhile on foot will throughThis neighbouring wood my way pursue,With elders and the twice-born men,And every lord and citizen.There is, I feel, no rest for meTill Ráma face again I see,Lakshman, in arms and glory great,And Sítá born to happy fate:No rest, until his cheek as brightAs the fair moon rejoice my sight,No rest until I see the eyeWith which the lotus petals vie;Till on my head those dear feet restWith signs of royal rank impressed;None, till my kingly brother gainHis old hereditary reign,Till o\\'er his limbs and noble headThe consecrating drops be shed.How blest is Janak daughter, trueTo every wifely duty, whoCleaves faithful to her husband sideWhose realm is girt by Ocean tide!This mountain too above the restE\\'en as the King of Hills is blest,--Whose shades Kakutstha scion holdAs Nandan charms the Lord of Gold.Yea, happy is this tangled groveWhere savage beasts unnumbered rove,Where, glory of the Warrior race,King Ráma finds a dwelling-place.\"Thus Bharat, strong-armed hero spake,And walked within the pathless brake.O\\'er plains where gay trees bloomed he went,Through boughs in tangled net-work bent,And then from Ráma cot appearedThe banner which the flame upreared.And Bharat joyed with every friendTo mark those smoky wreaths ascend:\"Here Ráma dwells,\" he thought; \"at lastThe ocean of our toil is passed.\"Then sure that Ráma hermit cotWas on the mountain sideHe stayed his army on the spot,And on with Guha hied.Canto C. The Meeting.Then Bharat to Satrughna showedThe spot, and eager onward strode,First bidding Saint Vasishtha bringThe widowed consorts of the king.As by fraternal love impelledHis onward course the hero held,Sumantra followed close behindSatrughna with an anxious mind:Not Bharat self more fain could beTo look on Ráma face than he.As, speeding on, the spot he neared,Amid the hermits\\' homes appearedHis brother cot with leaves o\\'erspread,And by its side a lowly shed.Before the shed great heaps were leftOf gathered flowers and billets cleft,And on the trees hung grass and barkRáma and Lakshman path to mark:And heaps of fuel to provideAgainst the cold stood ready dried.The long-armed chief, as on he wentIn glory light preëminent,With joyous words like these addressedThe brave Satrughna and the rest:\"This is the place, I little doubt,Which Bharadvája pointed out,Not far from where we stand must beThe woodland stream, Mandákiní.Here on the mountain woody sideRoam elephants in tusked pride,And ever with a roar and cryEach other, as they meet, defy.And see those smoke-wreaths thick and dark:The presence of the flame they mark,Which hermits in the forest striveBy every art to keep alive.O happy me! my task is done,And I shall look on Raghu son,Like some great saint, who loves to treatHis elders with all reverence meet.\"Thus Bharat reached that forest rill,Thus roamed on Chitrakúta hill;Then pity in his breast awoke,And to his friends the hero spoke:\"Woe, woe upon my life and birth!The prince of men, the lord of earthHas sought the lonely wood to dwellSequestered in a hermit cell.Through me, through me these sorrows fallOn him the splendid lord of all:Through me resigning earthly blissHe hides him in a home like this.Now will I, by the world abhorred,Fall at the dear feet of my lord,And at fair Sítá too, to winHis pardon for my heinous sin.\"As thus he sadly mourned and sighed,The son of Dasaratha spiedA bower of leafy branches made,Sacred and lovely in the shade,Of fair proportions large and tall,Well roofed with boughs of palm, and Sál,Arranged in order due o\\'erheadLike grass upon an altar spread.Two glorious bows were gleaming there,Like Indra(377) in the rainy air,Terror of foemen, backed with gold,Meet for the mightiest hand to hold:And quivered arrows cast a blazeBright gleaming like the Day-God rays:Thus serpents with their eyes aglowAdorn their capital below.(378)Great swords adorned the cottage, laidEach in a case of gold brocade;There hung the trusty shields, whereonWith purest gold the bosses shone.The brace to bind the bowman arm,The glove to shield his hand from harm,A lustre to the cottage lentFrom many a golden ornament:Safe was the cot from fear of menAs from wild beasts the lion den.The fire upon the altar burned,That to the north and east was turned.Bharat his eager glances bentAnd gazed within the cot intent;In deerskin dress, with matted hair,Ráma his chief was sitting there:With lion-shoulders broad and strong,With lotus eyes, arms thick and long.The righteous sovereign, who should beLord paramount from sea to sea,High-minded, born to lofty fate,Like Brahmá self supremely great;With Lakshman by his side, and her,Fair Sítá, for his minister.And Bharat gazing, overcomeBy sorrow for a while was dumb,Then, yielding to his woe, he ranTo Ráma and with sobs began:\"He who a royal seat should fillWith subjects round to do his will,My elder brother,--see him here,With silvan creatures waiting near.The high-souled hero, wont to wearThe costliest robes exceeding fair,Now banished, in a deerskin dress,Here keeps the path of righteousness.How brooks the son of Raghu nowThe matted locks which load his brow,Around whose princely head were twinedSweet blossoms of the rarest kind?The prince whose merits grew, acquiredBy rites performed as he desired,Would now a store of merit gainBought by his body toil and pain.Those limbs to which pure sandal lentThe freshness of its fragrant scent,Exposed to sun, and dust, and rain,Are now defiled with many a stain.And I the wretched cause why thisFalls on the prince whose right is bliss!Ah me, that ever I was bornTo be the people hate and scorn!\"Thus Bharat cried: of anguish sprung,Great drops upon his forehead hung.He fell o\\'erpowered--his grief was such--Ere he his brother feet could touch.As on the glorious prince he gazedIn vain his broken voice he raised:\"Dear lord\"--through tears and sobbing came,The only words his lips could frame.And brave Satrughna wept aloud,As low at Ráma feet he bowed.Then Ráma, while his tears ran fast,His arms around his brothers cast.Guha, Sumantra came to meetThe princes in their wild retreat.Vrihaspati and Sukra brightTheir greeting thus rejoice to payTo the dear Lord who brings the night,And the great God who rules the day.Then wept the dwellers of the shade,Whose eyes the princes, meet to rideOn mighty elephants, surveyed;And cast all thought of joy aside.Canto CI. Bharata Questioned.Then Ráma gazed, and scarcely knewBharat so worn and changed in hue.He raised him, kissed him on the head,Embraced him, and thus kindly said:\"Where was thy father, brother dear,That thou art come to seek me here?Unmeet, if he be living yet,Thy feet within the wood to set.I pray thee now the cause declareWhy thou hast left the kingdom there,With matted locks and deerskin dressTo roam the distant wilderness.\"Thus questioned by the prince, at lengthKaikeyí son regained his strength,And hand to hand in reverence laid,To Ráma thus his answer made:\"The great-armed monarch, O my lord,Has dared to do a thing abhorred,Left us, and grieving for his son,A home among the Gods has won.My mother Queen Kaikeyí gaveThe order to the king her slave,And at the bidding of the dameHe wrought the sin which mars his fame.Athirst for sway, her hopes are crossed,She mourns her son, her husband lost,And through her impious crime will goFor punishment to hell below.Now O my lord, forgive me all;Be gracious to thy lowly thrall:Anointed king, accept to-dayLike Indra self, the royal sway.Be gracious, Prince, to lord and peer,And widowed queens who seek thee hereAccept the kingdom thine by right,And so thy faithful friends delight.Let the broad land no longer beAll widowed and forlorn of thee:Let the full moon of autumn reignTriumphant o\\'er the night again.These lords and I before thee bend:O Ráma, to our prayer attend.O do not thou this grace deny:Thy brother, pupil, slave am I.Look on this venerable ring,Advisers of our sire the king,From age to age so honoured: thouShouldst grant their supplication now.\"As weeping thus the hero prayed,His head at Ráma feet he laid.Like a mad elephant he sighed:And Ráma gazed and thus replied:\"How, brother, can a man of worth,True to his vows, of noble birth--A man like me, commit a sinThe lordship of the land to win?No slightest shade of fault I see,O tamer of thy foes, in thee.But ne\\'er shouldst thou in childish thoughtThe queen thy mother blame in aught.O brother wise and sinless, knowThe sacred laws would have it so,That from good wife and son requireObedience to their lord and sire.And we are all the king, for thusThe virtuous ever reckon us:Yea brother, be it known to thee,His wives, and sons, and pupils we.His is the right, if he deem fit,To bid me, throned as monarch, sit,Or in a coat of bark expel,And deerskin, in the wood to dwell.And O remember, best of allWho act as claims of duty call,As to a virtuous sire is due,Such honour claims a mother too.So they whose lives have ever beenBy duty led, the king and queen,Said, \"Ráma, seek the forest shade:\"And I (what could I else?) obeyed.Thou must the royal power retain,And o\\'er the famed Ayodhyá reign:I dressed in bark my days will spendWhere Dandak forest wilds extend.So Dasaratha spoke, our king,His share to each apportioningBefore his honoured servants\\' eyes:Then, heir of bliss, he sought the skies.The righteous monarch honoured will,Whom all revered, must guide thee still,And thou must still enjoy the shareAssigned thee by our father care.So I till twice seven years are spentWill roam this wood in banishment,Contented with the lot which he,My high-souled sire, has given me.The charge the monarch gave, endearedTo all mankind, by all revered,Peer of the Lord Supreme,Far better, richer far in gainOf every blessing than to reignO\\'er all the worlds I deem.\"Canto CII. Bharat Tidings.He spoke: and Bharat thus replied:\"If, false to every claim beside,I ne\\'er in kingly duties fail,What will my royal life avail?Still should the custom be observed,From which our line has never swerved,Which to the younger son ne\\'er givesThe kingdom while the elder lives.Now to Ayodhyá rich and fairWith me, O Raghu son, repair,And to protect and gladden allOur house, thyself as king install.A king the world opinion deemsA man: to me a God he seems,Whose life in virtuous thoughts and deedsThe lives of other men exceeds.When I in distant Kekaya stayed,And thou hadst sought the forest shade,Our father died, the saints\\' delight,So constant in each holy rite.Scarce with thy wife and Lakshman thouHadst journeyed forth to keep the vow,When mourning for his son, forspent,To heavenly rest the monarch went.Then up, O lord of men, away!His funeral rites of water pay:I and Satrughna, ere we came,Neglected not the sacred claim.But in the spirit-world, they say,That gift alone is fresh for ayeWhich best beloved hands have poured;And thou his dearest art, my lord.For thee he longed, for thee he grieved,His every thought on thee was bent,And crushed by woe, of thee bereaved,He thought of thee as hence he went.\"Canto CIII. The Funeral Libation.When Ráma heard from Bharat eachDark sorrow of his mournful speech,And tidings of his father dead,His spirits fell, his senses fled.For the sad words his brother spokeStruck on him like a thunder stroke,Fierce as the bolt which Indra throws,The victor of his Daitya foes.Raising his arms in anguish, he,As when the woodman hews a treeWith its fair flowery branches crowned,Fainted and fell upon the ground.Lord of the earth to earth he sank,Helpless, as when a towering bankWith sudden ruin buries deepAn elephant who lay asleep.Then swift his wife and brothers flew,And water, weeping, o\\'er him threw.As slowly sense and strength he gained,Fast from his eyes the tears he rained,And then in accents sad and weakKakutstha son began to speak,And mourning for the monarch dead,With righteous words to Bharat said:\"What calls me home, when he, alas,Has gone the way which all must pass?Of him, the best of kings bereftWhat guardian has Ayodhyá left?How may I please his spirit? howDelight the high-souled monarch now,Who wept for me and went aboveBy me ungraced with mourning love?Ah, happy brothers! you have paidDue offerings to his parting shade.E\\'en when my banishment is o\\'er,Back to my home I go no more,To look upon the widowed stateReft of her king, disconsolate.E\\'en then, O tamer of the foe,If to Ayodhyá town I go,Who will direct me as of old,Now other worlds our father hold?From whom, my brother, shall I hearThose words which ever charmed mine earAnd filled my bosom with delightWhene\\'er he saw me act aright?\"Thus Ráma spoke: then nearer cameAnd looking on his moonbright dame,\"Sítá, the king is gone,\" he said:\"And Lakshman, know thy sire is dead,And with the Gods on high enrolled:This mournful news has Bharat told.\"He spoke: the noble youths with sighsRained down the torrents from their eyes.And then the brothers of the chiefWith words of comfort soothed his grief:\"Now to the king our sire who swayedThe earth be due libations paid.\"Soon as the monarch fate she knew,Sharp pangs of grief smote Sítá through:Nor could she look upon her lordWith eyes from which the torrents poured.And Ráma strove with tender careTo soothe the weeping dame despair,And then, with piercing woe distressed,The mournful Lakshman thus addressed:\"Brother, I pray thee bring for meThe pressed fruit of the Ingudí,And a bark mantle fresh and new,That I may pay this offering due.First of the three shall Sítá go,Next thou, and I the last: for soMoves the funereal pomp of woe.\"(379)Sumantra of the noble mind,Gentle and modest, meek and kind,Who, follower of each princely youth,To Ráma clung with constant truth,Now with the royal brothers\\' aidThe grief of Ráma soothed and stayed,And lent his arm his lord to guideDown to the river holy side.That lovely stream the heroes found,With woods that ever blossomed crowned,And there in bitter sorrow bentTheir footsteps down the fair descent.Then where the stream that swiftly flowedA pure pellucid shallow showed,The funeral drops they duly shed,And \"Father, this be thine,\" they said.But he, the lord who ruled the land,Filled from the stream his hollowed hand,And turning to the southern sideStretched out his arm and weeping cried:\"This sacred water clear and pure,An offering which shall aye endureTo thee, O lord of kings, I give:Accept it where the spirits live!\"Then, when the solemn rite was o\\'er,Came Ráma to the river shore,And offered, with his brothers\\' aid,Fresh tribute to his father shade.With jujube fruit he mixed the seedOf Ingudís from moisture freed,And placed it on a spot o\\'erspreadWith sacred grass, and weeping said:\"Enjoy, great King, the cake which weThy children eat and offer thee!For ne\\'er do blessed Gods refuseTo share the food which mortals use.\"Then Ráma turned him to retraceThe path that brought him to the place,And up the mountain pleasant sideWhere lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.Soon as his cottage door he gainedHis brothers to his breast he strained.From them and Sítá in their woesSo loud the cry of weeping rose,That like the roar of lions roundThe mountain rolled the echoing sound.And Bharat army shook with fearThe weeping of the chiefs to hear.\"Bharat,\" the soldiers cried, \"\\'tis plain,His brother Ráma meets again,And with these cries that round us ringThey sorrow for their sire the king.\"Then leaving car and wain behind,One eager thought in every mind,Swift toward the weeping, every man,As each could find a passage, ran.Some thither bent their eager courseWith car, and elephant, and horse,And youthful captains on their feetWith longing sped their lord to meet,As though the new-come prince had beenAn exile for long years unseen.Earth beaten in their frantic zealBy clattering hoof and rumbling wheel,Sent forth a deafening noise as loudAs heaven when black with many a cloud.Then, with their consorts gathered near,Wild elephants in sudden fearRushed to a distant wood, and shedAn odour round them as they fled.And every silvan thing that dweltWithin those shades the terror felt,Deer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,Bison, wild-cow, and buffalo.And when the tumult wild they heard,With trembling pinions flew each bird,From tree, from thicket, and from lake,Swan, koďl, curlew, crane, and drake.With men the ground was overspread,With startled birds the sky o\\'erhead.Then on his sacrificial groundThe sinless, glorious chief was found.Loading with curses deep and loudThe hump-back and the queen, the crowdWhose cheeks were wet, whose eyes were dim,In fond affection ran to him.While the big tears their eyes bedewed,He looked upon the multitude,And then as sire and mother do,His arms about his loved ones threw.Some to his feet with reverence pressed,Some in his arms he strained:Each friend, with kindly words addressed,Due share of honour gained.Then, by their mighty woe o\\'ercome,The weeping heroes\\' cryFilled, like the roar of many a drum,Hill, cavern, earth, and sky.Canto CIV. The Meeting With The Queens.Vasishtha with his soul athirstTo look again on Ráma, firstIn line the royal widows placed,And then the way behind them traced.The ladies moving, faint and slow,Saw the fair stream before them flow,And by the bank their steps were ledWhich the two brothers visited.Kausalyá with her faded cheekAnd weeping eyes began to speak,And thus in mournful tones addressedThe queen Sumitrá and the rest:\"See in the wood the bank descent,Which the two orphan youths frequent,Whose noble spirits never fall,Though woes surround them, reft of all.Thy son with love that never tiresDraws water hence which mine requires.This day, for lowly toil unfit,His pious task thy son should quit.\"As on the long-eyed lady strayed,On holy grass, whose points were laidDirected to the southern sky,The funeral offering met her eye.When Ráma humble gift she spiedThus to the queens Kausalyá cried:\"The gift of Ráma hand behold,His tribute to the king high-souled,Offered to him, as texts require,Lord of Ikshváku line, his sire!Not such I deem the funeral foodOf kings with godlike might endued.Can he who knew all pleasures, heWho ruled the earth from sea to sea,The mighty lord of monarchs, feedOn Ingudí extracted seed?In all the world there cannot beA woe, I ween, more sad to see,Than that my glorious son should makeHis funeral gift of such a cake.The ancient text I oft have heardThis day is true in every word:\"Ne\\'er do the blessed Gods refuseTo eat the food their children use.\\' \"The ladies soothed the weeping dame:To Ráma hermitage they came,And there the hero met their eyesLike a God fallen from the skies.Him joyless, reft of all, they viewed,And tears their mournful eyes bedewed.The truthful hero left his seat,And clasped the ladies\\' lotus feet,And they with soft hands brushed awayThe dust that on his shoulders lay.Then Lakshman, when he saw each queenWith weeping eyes and troubled mien,Near to the royal ladies drewAnd paid them gentle reverence too.He, Dasaratha offspring, signedThe heir of bliss by Fortune kind,Received from every dame no lessEach mark of love and tenderness.And Sítá came and bent beforeThe widows, while her eyes ran o\\'er,And pressed their feet with many a tear.They when they saw the lady dearPale, worn with dwelling in the wild,Embraced her as a darling child:\"Daughter of royal Janak, brideOf Dasaratha son,\" they cried,\"How couldst thou, offspring of a king,Endure this woe and sufferingIn the wild forest? When I traceEach sign of trouble on thy face--That lotus which the sun has dried,That lily by the tempest tried,That gold whereon the dust is spread,That moon whence all the light is fled--Sorrow assails my heart, alas!As fire consumes the wood and grass.\"Then Ráma, as she spoke distressed,The feet of Saint Vasishtha pressed,Touched them with reverential love,Then near him took his seat:Thus Indra clasps in realms aboveThe Heavenly Teacher(380) feet.Then with each counsellor and peer,Bharat of duteous mind,With citizens and captains near,Sat humbly down behind.When with his hands to him upraised,In devotee attire,Bharat upon his brother gazedWhose glory shone like fire,As when the pure Mahendra bendsTo the great Lord of Life,Among his noble crowd of friendsThis anxious thought was rife:\"What words to Raghu son to-dayWill royal Bharat speak,Whose heart has been so prompt to payObeisance fond and meek?\"Then steadfast Ráma, Lakshman wise,Bharat for truth renowned,Shone like three fires that heavenward riseWith holy priests around.Canto CV. Ráma Speech.A while they sat, each lip compressed,Then Bharat thus his chief addressed:\"My mother here was made content;To me was given the government.This now, my lord, I yield to thee:Enjoy it, from all trouble free.Like a great bridge the floods have rent,Impetuous in their wild descent,All other hands but thine in vainWould strive the burthen to maintain.In vain the ass with steeds would vie,With Tárkshya,(381) birds that wing the sky;So, lord of men, my power is slightTo rival thine imperial might.Great joys his happy days attendOn whom the hopes of men depend,But wretched is the life he leadsWho still the aid of others needs.And if the seed a man has sown,With care and kindly nurture grown,Rear its huge trunk and spring in timeToo bulky for a dwarf to climb,Yet, with perpetual blossom gay,No fruit upon its boughs display,Ne\\'er can that tree, thus nursed in vain,Approval of the virtuous gain.The simile is meant to beApplied, O mighty-armed, to thee,Because, our lord and leader, thouProtectest not thy people now.O, be the longing wish fulfilledOf every chief of house and guild,To see again their sun-bright lordVictorious to his realm restored!As thou returnest through the crowdLet roars of elephants be loud.And each fair woman lift her voiceAnd in her new-found king rejoice.\"The people all with longing moved,The words that Bharat spoke approved,And crowding near to Ráma pressedThe hero with the same request.The steadfast Ráma, when he viewedHis glorious brother mournful mood,With each ambitious thought controlled,Thus the lamenting prince consoled:\"I cannot do the things I will,For Ráma is but mortal still.Fate with supreme, resistless lawThis way and that its slave will draw,All gathered heaps must waste away,All lofty lore and powers decay.Death is the end of life, and all,Now firmly joined, apart must fall.One fear the ripened fruit must know,To fall upon the earth below;So every man who draws his breathMust fear inevitable death.The pillared mansion, high, compact,Must fall by Time strong hand attacked;So mortal men, the gradual preyOf old and ruthless death, decay.The night that flies no more returns:Yamuná for the Ocean yearns:Swift her impetuous waters flee,But roll not backward from the sea.The days and nights pass swiftly byAnd steal our moments as they fly,E\\'en as the sun unpitying raysDrink up the floods in summer blaze.Then for thyself lament and leaveFor death of other men to grieve,For if thou go or if thou stay,Thy life is shorter day by day.Death travels with us; death attendsOur steps until our journey ends,Death, when the traveller wins the goal,Returns with the returning soul.The flowing hair grows white and thin,And wrinkles mark the altered skin.The ills of age man strength assail:Ah, what can mortal power avail?Men joy to see the sun arise,They watch him set with joyful eyes:But ne\\'er reflect, too blind to see,How fast their own brief moments flee.With lovely change for ever newThe seasons\\' sweet return they view,Nor think with heedless hearts the whileThat lives decay as seasons smile.As haply on the boundless mainMeet drifting logs and part again,So wives and children, friends and gold,Ours for a little time we hold:Soon by resistless laws of fateTo meet no more we separate.In all this changing world not oneThe common lot of all can shun:Then why with useless tears deploreThe dead whom tears can bring no more?As one might stand upon the wayAnd to a troop of travellers say:\"If ye allow it, sirs, I tooWill travel on the road with you:\"So why should mortal man lamentWhen on that path his feet are bentWhich all men living needs must tread,Where sire and ancestors have led?Life flies as torrents downward fallSpeeding away without recall,So virtue should our thoughts engage,For bliss(382) is mortals\\' heritage.By ceaseless care and earnest zealFor servants and for people weal,By gifts, by duty nobly done,Our glorious sire the skies has won.Our lord the king, o\\'er earth who reigned,A blissful home in heaven has gainedBy wealth in ample largess spent,And many a rite magnificent:With constant joy from first to lastA long and noble life he passed,Praised by the good, no tears should dimOur eyes, O brother dear, for him.His human body, worn and triedBy length of days, he cast aside,And gained the godlike bliss to strayIn Brahmá heavenly home for aye.For such the wise as we are, deepIn Veda lore, should never weep.Those who are firm and ever wiseSpurn vain lament and idle sighs.Be self-possessed: thy grief restrain:Go, in that city dwell again.Return, O best of men, and beObedient to our sire decree,While I with every care fulfilOur holy father righteous will,Observing in the lonely woodHis charge approved by all the good.\"Thus Ráma of the lofty mindTo Bharat spoke his righteous speech,By every argument designedObedience to his sire to teach.Canto CVI. Bharat Speech.Good Bharat, by the river side,To virtuous Ráma speech replied,And thus with varied lore addressedThe prince, while nobles round him pressed:\"In all this world whom e\\'er can weFind equal, scourge of foes, to thee?No ill upon thy bosom weighs,No thoughts of joy thy spirit raise.Approved art thou of sages old,To whom thy doubts are ever told.Alike in death and life, to theeThe same to be and not to be.The man who such a soul can gainCan ne\\'er be crushed by woe or pain.Pure as the Gods, high-minded, wise,Concealed from thee no secret lies.Such glorious gifts are all thine own,And birth and death to thee are known,That ill can ne\\'er thy soul depressWith all-subduing bitterness.O let my prayer, dear brother, winThy pardon for my mother sin.Wrought for my sake who willed it notWhen absent in a distant spot.Duty alone with binding chainsThe vengeance due to crime restrains,Or on the sinner I should liftMy hand in retribution swift.Can I who know the right, and springFrom Dasaratha, purest king--Can I commit a heinous crime,Abhorred by all through endless time?The aged king I dare not blame,Who died so rich in holy fame,My honoured sire, my parted lord,E\\'en as a present God adored.Yet who in lore of duty skilledSo foul a crime has ever willed,And dared defy both gain and rightTo gratify a woman spite?When death draws near, so people say,The sense of creatures dies away;And he has proved the ancient sawBy acting thus in spite of law.But O my honoured lord, be kind,Dismiss the trespass from thy mind,The sin the king committed, ledBy haste, his consort wrath, and dread.For he who veils his sire offenceWith tender care and reverence--His sons approved by all shall live:Not so their fate who ne\\'er forgive.Be thou, my lord, the noble son,And the vile deed my sire has done,Abhorred by all the virtuous, ne\\'erResent, lest thou the guilt too share.Preserve us, for on thee we call,Our sire, Kaikeyí, me and allThy citizens, thy kith and kin;Preserve us and reverse the sin.To live in woods a devoteeCan scarce with royal tasks agree,Nor can the hermit matted hairSuit fitly with a ruler care.Do not, my brother, do not stillPursue this life that suits thee ill.Mid duties of a king we countHis consecration paramount,That he with ready heart and handMay keep his people and his land.What Warrior born to royal swayFrom certain good would turn away,A doubtful duty to pursue,That mocks him with the distant view?Thou wouldst to duty cleave, and gainThe meed that follows toil and pain.In thy great task no labour spare:Rule the four castes with justest care.Mid all the four, the wise preferThe order of the householder:(383)Canst thou, whose thoughts to duty cleave,The best of all the orders leave?My better thou in lore divine,My birth, my sense must yield to thine:While thou, my lord, art here to reign,How shall my hands the rule maintain?O faithful lover of the right,Take with thy friends the royal might,Let thy sires\\' realm, from trouble free,Obey her rightful king in thee.Here let the priests and lords of stateOur monarch duly consecrate,With prayer and holy verses blessedBy saint Vasishtha and the rest.Anointed king by us, againSeek fair Ayodhyá, there to reign,And like imperial Indra girtBy Gods of Storm, thy might assert.From the three debts(384) acquittance earn,And with thy wrath the wicked burn,O\\'er all of us thy rule extend,And cheer with boons each faithful friend.Let thine enthronement, lord, this dayMake all thy lovers glad and gay,And let all those who hate thee fleeTo the ten winds for fear of thee.Dear lord, my mother words of hateWith thy sweet virtues expiate,And from the stain of folly clearThe father whom we both revere.Brother, to me compassion show,I pray thee with my head bent low,And to these friends who on thee call,--As the Great Father pities all.But if my tears and prayers be vain,And thou in woods wilt still remain,I will with thee my path pursueAnd make my home in forests too.\"Thus Bharat strove to bend his willWith suppliant head, but he,Earth lord, inexorable stillWould keep his sire decree.The firmness of the noble chiefThe wondering people moved,And rapture mingling with their grief,All wept and all approved.\"How firm his steadfast will,\" they cried,\"Who Keeps his promise thus!Ah, to Ayodhyá town,\" they sighed,\"He comes not back with us.\"The holy priest, the swains who tilledThe earth, the sons of trade,And e\\'en the mournful queens were filledWith joy as Bharat prayed,And bent their heads, then weeping stilledA while, his prayer to aid.Canto CVII. Ráma Speech.Thus, by his friends encompassed round,He spoke, and Ráma, far renowned,To his dear brother thus replied,Whom holy rites had purified:\"O thou whom Queen Kaikeyí bareThe best of kings, thy words are fair,Our royal father, when of yoreHe wed her, to her father sworeThe best of kingdoms to confer,A noble dowry meet for her;Then, grateful, on the deadly dayOf heavenly Gods\\' and demons\\' fray,A future boon on her bestowedTo whose sweet care his life he owed.She to his mind that promise brought,And then the best of kings besoughtTo bid me to the forest flee,And give the rule, O Prince, to thee.Thus bound by oath, the king our lordGave her those boons of free accord,And bade me, O thou chief of men,Live in the woods four years and ten.I to this lonely wood have hiedWith faithful Lakshman by my side,And Sítá by no tears deterred,Resolved to keep my father word.And thou, my noble brother, tooShouldst keep our father promise true:Anointed ruler of the stateMaintain his word inviolate.From his great debt, dear brother, freeOur lord the king for love of me,Thy mother breast with joy inspire,And from all woe preserve thy sire.\\'Tis said, near Gayá holy town(385)Gayá, great saint of high renown,This text recited when he paidDue rites to each ancestral shade:\"A son is born his sire to freeFrom Put infernal pains:Hence, saviour of his father, heThe name of Puttra gains.\"(386)Thus numerous sons are sought by prayer,In Scripture trained with graces fair,That of the number one some dayMay funeral rites at Gayá pay.The mighty saints who lived of oldThis holy doctrine ever hold.Then, best of men, our sire releaseFrom pains of hell, and give him peace.Now Bharat, to Ayodhyá speed,The brave Satrughna with thee lead,Take with thee all the twice-born men,And please each lord and citizen.I now, O King, without delayTo Dandak wood will bend my way,And Lakshman and the Maithil dameWill follow still, our path the same.Now, Bharat, lord of men be thou,And o\\'er Ayodhyá reign:The silvan world to me shall bow,King of the wild domain.Yea, let thy joyful steps be bentTo that fair town to-day,And I as happy and content,To Dandak wood will stray.The white umbrella o\\'er thy browIts cooling shade shall throw:I to the shadow of the boughAnd leafy trees will go.Satrughna, for wise plans renowned,Shall still on thee attend;And Lakshman, ever faithful found,Be my familiar friend.Let us his sons, O brother dear,The path of right pursue,And keep the king we all revereStill to his promise true.\"Canto CVIII. Jáváli Speech.Thus Ráma soothed his brother grief:Then virtuous Jáváli, chiefOf twice-born sages, thus repliedIn words that virtue law defied:\"Hail, Raghu princely son, dismissA thought so weak and vain as this.Canst thou, with lofty heart endowed,Think with the dull ignoble crowd?For what are ties of kindred? canOne profit by a brother man?Alone the babe first opes his eyes,And all alone at last he dies.The man, I ween, has little senseWho looks with foolish reverenceOn father or on mother name:In others, none a right may claim.E\\'en as a man may leave his homeAnd to a distant village roam,Then from his lodging turn awayAnd journey on the following day,Such brief possession mortals holdIn sire and mother, house and gold,And never will the good and wiseThe brief uncertain lodging prize.Nor, best of men, shouldst thou disownThy sire hereditary throne,And tread the rough and stony groundWhere hardship, danger, woes abound.Come, let Ayodhyá rich and brightSee thee enthroned with every rite:Her tresses bound in single braid(387)She waits thy coming long delayed.O come, thou royal Prince, and shareThe kingly joys that wait thee there,And live in bliss transcending priceAs Indra lives in Paradise.The parted king is naught to thee,Nor right in living man has he:The king is one, thou, Prince of men,Another art: be counselled then.Thy royal sire, O chief, has spedOn the long path we all must tread.The common lot of all is this,And thou in vain art robbed of bliss.For those--and only those--I weepWho to the path of duty keep;For here they suffer ceaseless woe,And dying to destruction go.With pious care, each solemn day,Will men their funeral offerings pay:See, how the useful food they waste:He who is dead no more can taste.If one is fed, his strength renewedWhene\\'er his brother takes his food,Then offerings to the parted pay:Scarce will they serve him on his way.By crafty knaves these rules were framed,And to enforce men gifts proclaimed:\"Give, worship, lead a life austere,Keep lustral rites, quit pleasures here.\"There is no future life: be wise,And do, O Prince, as I advise.Enjoy, my lord, the present bliss,And things unseen from thought dismiss.Let this advice thy bosom move,The counsel sage which all approve;To Bharat earnest prayer incline,And take the rule so justly thine.\"Canto CIX. The Praises Of Truth.By sage Jáváli thus addressed,Ráma of truthful hearts the best,With perfect skill and wisdom highThus to his speech made fit reply:\"Thy words that tempt to bliss are fair,But virtue garb they falsely wear.For he from duty path who straysTo wander in forbidden ways,Allured by doctrine false and vain,Praise from the good can never gain.Their lives the true and boaster show,Pure and impure, and high and low,Else were no mark to judge betweenStainless and stained and high and mean;They to whose lot fair signs may fallWere but as they who lack them all,And those to virtuous thoughts inclinedWere but as men of evil mind.If in the sacred name of rightI do this wrong in duty spite;The path of virtue meanly quit,And this polluting sin commit,What man who marks the bounds betweenVirtue and vice with insight keen,Would rank me high in after timeStained with this soul destroying crime?Whither could I, the sinner, turn,How hope a seat in heaven to earn,If I my plighted promise break,And thus the righteous path forsake?This world of ours is ever ledTo walk the ways which others tread,And as their princes they behold,The subjects too their lives will mould.That truth and mercy still must beBeloved of kings, is Heaven decree.Upheld by truth the monarch reigns,And truth the very world sustains.Truth evermore has been the loveOf holy saints and Gods above,And he whose lips are truthful hereWins after death the highest sphere.As from a serpent deadly tooth,We shrink from him who scorns the truth.For holy truth is root and springOf justice and each holy thing,A might that every power transcends,Linked to high bliss that never ends.Truth is all virtue surest base,Supreme in worth and first in place.Oblations, gifts men offer here,Vows, sacrifice, and rites austere,And Holy Writ, on truth depend:So men must still that truth defend.Truth, only truth protects the land,By truth unharmed our houses stand;Neglect of truth makes men distressed,And truth in highest heaven is blessed.Then how can I, rebellious, breakCommandments which my father spake--I ever true and faithful found,And by my word of honour bound?My father bridge of truth shall standUnharmed by my destructive hand:Not folly, ignorance, or greedMy darkened soul shall thus mislead.Have we not heard that God and shadeTurn from the hated offerings paidBy him whose false and fickle mindNo pledge can hold, no promise bind?Truth is all duty: as the soul,It quickens and supports the whole.The good respect this duty: henceIts sacred claims I reverence.The Warrior duty I despiseThat seeks the wrong in virtue guise:Those claims I shrink from, which the base,Cruel, and covetous embrace.The heart conceives the guilty thought,Then by the hand the sin is wrought,And with the pair is leagued a third,The tongue that speaks the lying word.Fortune and land and name and fameTo man best care have right and claim;The good will aye to truth adhere,And its high laws must men revere.Base were the deed thy lips would teach,Approved as best by subtle speech.Shall I my plighted promise break,That I these woods my home would make?Shall I, as Bharat words advise,My father solemn charge despise?Firm stands the oath which then beforeMy father face I soothly swore,Which Queen Kaikeyí anxious earRejoiced with highest joy to hear.Still in the wood will I remain,With food prescribed my life sustain,And please with fruit and roots and flowersAncestral shades and heavenly powers.Here every sense contented, stillHeeding the bounds of good and ill,My settled course will I pursue,Firm in my faith and ever true.Here in this wild and far retreatWill I my noble task complete;And Fire and Wind and Moon shall bePartakers of its fruit with me.A hundred offerings duly wroughtHis rank o\\'er Gods for Indra bought,And mighty saints their heaven securedBy torturing years on earth endured.\"That scoffing plea the hero spurned,And thus he spake once more,Chiding, the while his bosom burned,Jáváli impious lore:\"Justice, and courage ne\\'er dismayed,Pity for all distressed,Truth, loving honour duly paidTo Bráhman, God, and guest--In these, the true and virtuous say,Should lives of men be passed:They form the right and happy wayThat leads to heaven at last.My father thoughtless act I chideThat gave thee honoured place,Whose soul, from virtue turned aside,Is faithless, dark, and base.We rank the Buddhist with the thief,(388)And all the impious crewWho share his sinful disbelief,And hate the right and true.Hence never should wise kings who seekTo rule their people well,Admit, before their face to speak,The cursed infidel.But twice-born men in days gone by,Of other sort than thou,Have wrought good deeds, whose glories highAre fresh among us now:This world they conquered, nor in vainThey strove to win the skies:The twice-born hence pure lives maintain,And fires of worship rise.Those who in virtue path delight,And with the virtuous live,--Whose flames of holy zeal are bright,Whose hands are swift to give,Who injure none, and good and mildIn every grace excel,Whose lives by sin are undefiled,We love and honour well.\"Thus Ráma spoke in righteous rageJáváli speech to chide,When thus again the virtuous sageIn truthful words replied:\"The atheist lore I use no more,Not mine his impious creed:His words and doctrine I abhor,Assumed at time of need.E\\'en as I rose to speak with thee,The fit occasion cameThat bade me use the atheist pleaTo turn thee from thine aim.The atheist creed I disavow,Unsay the words of sin,And use the faithful language nowThy favour, Prince, to win.\"Canto CX. The Sons Of Ikshváku.(389)Then spake Vasishtha who perceivedThat Ráma soul was wroth and grieved:\"Well knows the sage Jáváli allThe changes that the world befall;And but to lead thee to revokeThy purpose were the words he spoke.Lord of the world, now hear from meHow first this world began to be.First water was, and naught beside;There earth was formed that stretches wide.Then with the Gods from out the sameThe Self-existent Brahmá came.Then Brahmá(390) in a boar disguiseBade from the deep this earth arise;Then, with his sons of tranquil soul,He made the world and framed the whole.From subtlest ether Brahmá rose:No end, no loss, no change he knows.A son had he, Maríchi styled,And Kasyap was Maríchi child.From him Vivasvat sprang: from himManu, whose fame shall ne\\'er be dim.Manu, who life to mortals gave,Begot Ikshváku good and brave:First of Ayodhyá kings was he,Pride of her famous dynasty.From him the glorious Kukshi sprang,Whose fame through all the regions rang.Rival of Kukshi ancient fame,His heir the great Vikukshi came.His son was Vána, lord of might,His Anaranya, strong in fight.No famine marred his blissful reign,No drought destroyed the kindly grain;Amid the sons of virtue chief,His happy realm ne\\'er held a thief,His son was Prithu, glorious name,From him the wise Trisanku came:Embodied to the skies he wentFor love of truth preëminent.He left a son renowned afar,Known by the name of Dhundhumár.His son succeeding bore the nameOf Yuvanásva dear to fame.He passed away. Him followed thenHis son Mándhátá, king of men.His son was blest in high emprise,Susandhi, fortunate and wise.Two noble sons had he, to witDhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.Bharat was Dhruvasandhi son:His glorious arm the conquest won,Against his son King Asit, roseIn fierce array his royal foes,Haihayas, Tálajanghas styled,And Sasivindhus fierce and wild.Long time he strove, but forced to yieldFled from his kingdom and the field.The wives he left had both conceived--So is the ancient tale believed:--One, of her rival hopes afraid,Fell poison in the viands laid.It chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu child,Had wandered to the pathless wildWhere proud Himálaya lovely heightDetained him with a strange delight.Then came the other widowed queenWith lotus eyes and beauteous mien,Longing a noble son to bear,And wooed the saint with earnest prayer.When thus Kálindí, fairest dameWith reverent supplication came,To her the holy sage replied:\"O royal lady, from thy sideA glorious son shall spring ere long,Righteous and true and brave and strong;He, scourge of foes and lofty-souled,His ancient race shall still uphold.\"Then round the sage the lady went,And bade farewell, most reverent.Back to her home she turned once more,And there her promised son she bore.Because her rival mixed the baneTo render her conception vain,And her unripened fruit destroy,Sagar she called her rescued boy.(391)He, when he paid that solemn rite,(392)Filled living creatures with affright:Obedient to his high decreeHis countless sons dug out the sea.Prince Asamanj was Sagar child:But him with cruel sin defiledAnd loaded with the people hateHis father banished from the state.To Asamanj his consort bareBright Ansumán his valiant heir.Ansumán son, Dilípa famed,Begot a son Bhagírath named.From him renowned Kakutstha came:Thou bearest still the lineal name.Kakutstha son was Raghu: thouArt styled the son of Raghu now.From him came Purushádak bold,Fierce hero of gigantic mould:Kalmáshapáda name he bore,Because his feet were spotted o\\'er.Sankhan his son, to manhood grown,Died sadly with his host o\\'erthrown,But ere he perished sprang from himSudarsan fair in face and limb.From beautiful Sudarsan camePrince Agnivarna, bright as flame.His son was Síghraga, for speedUnmatched; and Maru was his seed.Prasusruka was Maru child:His son was Ambarísha styled.Nahush was Ambarísha heirWith hand to strike and heart to dare.His son was good Nábhág, from youthRenowned for piety and truth.From great Nábhág sprang children twoAja and Suvrat pure and true.From Aja Dasaratha came,Whose virtuous life was free from blame.His eldest son art thou: his throne,O famous Ráma, is thine own.Accept the sway so justly thine,And view the world with eyes benign.For ever in Ikshváku raceThe eldest takes his father place,And while he lives no son besideAs lord and king is sanctified.The rule by Raghu children keptThou must not spurn to-day.This realm of peerless wealth accept,And like thy father sway.\"Canto CXI. Counsel To Bharat.Thus said Vasishtha, and againTo Ráma spake in duteous strain:\"All men the light of life who seeWith high respect should look on three:High honour ne\\'er must be deniedTo father, mother, holy guide.First to their sires their birth they owe,Nursed with maternal love they grow:Their holy guides fair knowledge teach:So men should love and honour each.Thy sire and thou have learned of me,The sacred guide of him and thee,And if my word thou wilt obeyThou still wilt keep the virtuous way.See, with the chiefs of every guildAnd all thy friends, this place is filled:All these, as duty bids, protect;So still the righteous path respect.O, for thine aged mother feel,Nor spurn the virtuous dame appeal:Obey, O Prince, thy mother dear,And still to virtue path adhere.Yield thou to Bharat fond request,With earnest supplication pressed,So wilt thou to thyself be true,And faith and duty still pursue.\"Thus by his saintly guide addressedWith pleas in sweetest tones expressed,The lord of men in turn repliedTo wise Vasishtha by his side:\"The fondest son observance ne\\'erRepays the sire and mother care:The constant love that food provides,And dress, and every need besides:Their pleasant words still soft and mild,Their nurture of the helpless child:The words which Dasaratha spake,My king and sire, I ne\\'er will break.\"Then Bharat of the ample chestThe wise Sumantra thus addressed;\"Bring sacred grass, O charioteer,And strew it on the level here.For I will sit and watch his faceUntil I win my brother grace.Like a robbed Bráhman will I lie,(393)Nor taste of food nor turn my eye,In front of Ráma leafy cot,And till he yield will leave him not.\"When Bharat saw Sumantra eyeLooked up to Ráma for reply,The Prince himself in eager hasteThe sacred grass in order placed.Him great and mighty Ráma, bestOf royal saints, in turn addressed:\"What, Bharat, have I done, that thouBesiegest me,(394) a suppliant now?Thus streched, to force redress for wrongsTo men of Bráhman birth belongs,Not those upon whose kingly headThe consecrating drops are shed.Up, lord of men! arise, and quitThis fearful vow for thee unfit.Go, brother, seek Ayodhyá town,Fair city of supreme renown.\"But Bharat, as his seat he took,Cast all around an eager look:\"O people, join your prayers with mine,And so his stubborn heart incline.\"And all the people answered thus:\"Full well is Ráma known to us.Right is the word he speaks and heIs faithful to his sire decree:Nor can we rashly venture nowTo turn him from his purposed vow.\"Then Ráma spoke: \"O Bharat, heedThy virtuous friends, and mark their rede.Mark well what I and these advise,And duty view with clearer eyes.Thy hand on mine, O hero, place,Touch water, and thy sin efface.\"Then Bharat rose: his hand he dipped,And purifying water sipped:\"Each citizen,\" he cried, \"give ear,Attend, each counsellor and peer.My mother planned, by me untaught,To win the sway I never sought:Ne\\'er Raghu son could I despise,In duty lore supremely wise.Now if obedience to our sireThis dwelling in the woods require,I, till the destined years be spent,Will dwell alone in banishment.\"The virtuous Ráma, wonder-stirred,The faithful speech of Bharat heard,And thus the hero feelings foundDue utterance, as he gazed around:\"Still to my father word I hold,Whate\\'er he bought, or pledged, or sold:Ne\\'er shall his living promise beAnnulled by Bharat or by me.Not thus my task will I evade,My exile on another laid:Most wise was Queen Kaikeyí rede,And just and good my father deed.Dear Bharat patient soul I know,How reverence due he loves to show;In him, high-souled and faithful found,Must each auspicious grace abound.When from the woods I turn againI with his aid shall nobly reign,With one so good, of peerless worth,A glorious lord of happy earth.Her boon Kaikeyí sought and won.I, as my father swore, have done:And O, do thou, my brother dear,The monarch name from falsehood clear.Canto CXII. The Sandals.High wonder mingled with delightTook the great sages at the sight,Thrilling their breasts who came to viewThe meeting of the peerless two.The saints and sages\\' holy trainDeparted to their home again.And high each holy voice was raised,And thus the glorious brothers praised.\"High fate is his, the sire of twoMost virtuous souls, so brave and true:With wonder and with joy intenseOur ears have heard their conference.\"Then the great sages, longing allTo see the ten-necked tyrant(395) fall,To Bharat, bravest of the brave,Their salutary counsel gave:\"O thou of lofty lineage born,Whom wisdom, conduct, fame adorn,Thou for thy honoured father sakeShouldst Ráma righteous counsel take.All debts to Queen Kaikeyí paid,Thy sire his home in heaven has made,So virtuous Ráma we would seeFrom filial obligation free.\"Thus gave each royal sage advice,High saint, and bard of Paradise;Then quickly vanishing from viewEach to his proper home withdrew.Then Ráma face his rapture showed,And his full heart with joy o\\'erflowed,While, as the sages parted thence,He paid his humble reverence.Then Bharat shook in every limbAs suppliant thus he spake to him:\"The duty of a king respect,Held by our race in high respect:And O, thy gracious ear inclineTo heed my mother prayer and mine.The mighty realm to rule and guardFor me alone is task too hard.No power have I the love to gainOf noble, citizen, and swain.All those who know thee, warrior, friend,On thee their eager glances bend,As labouring hinds who till the plainLook fondly for the Lord of Rain.O wisest Prince, thy realm secure,And make its firm foundations sure.Kakutstha son, thy mighty armCan keep the nation free from harm.\"He spoke, and fell in sorrow drownedAt Ráma feet upon the ground,And there the hero sued and sighed,And \"Hear me, Raghu son,\" he cried.Then Ráma raised him up, and pressedHis brother to his loving breast,And sweetly as a wild swan criedTo Bharat dark and lotus-eyed:\"So just and true thy generous soul,Thy hand may well this earth control:But many a sage his aid will lend,With counsellor, and peer, and friend:With these advise: their counsel ask,And so perform thy arduous task.The moon his beauty may forgo,The cold forsake the Hills of Snow,And Ocean o\\'er his banks may sweep,But I my father word will keep.Now whether love of thee or greedThy mother led to plan the deed,Forth from thy breast the memory throw,And filial love and reverence show.\"Thus spake Kausalyá son: againBharat replied in humble strainTo him who matched the sun in mightAnd lovely as the young moon light:\"Put, noble brother, I entreat,These sandals on thy blessed feet:These, lord of men, with gold bedecked,The realm and people will protect.\"Then Ráma, as his brother prayedBeneath his feet the sandals laid,And these with fond affection gaveTo Bharat hand, the good and brave.Then Bharat bowed his reverent headAnd thus again to Ráma said:\"Through fourteen seasons will I wearThe hermit dress and matted hair:With fruit and roots my life sustain,And still beyond the realm remain,Longing for thee to come again.The rule and all affairs of stateI to these shoes will delegate.And if, O tamer of thy foes,When fourteen years have reached their close,I see thee not that day return,The kindled fire my frame shall burn.\"Then Ráma to his bosom drewDear Bharat and Satrughna too:\"Be never wroth,\" he cried, \"with her,Kaikeyí guardian minister:This, glory of Ikshváku line,Is Sítá earnest prayer and mine.\"He spoke, and as the big tears fell,To his dear brother bade farewell.Round Ráma, Bharat strong and boldIn humble reverence paced,When the bright sandals wrought with goldAbove his brows were placed.The royal elephant who ledThe glorious pomp he found,And on the monster mighty headThose sandals duly bound.Then noble Ráma, born to swellThe glories of his race,To all in order bade farewellWith love and tender grace--To brothers, counsellers, and peers,--Still firm, in duty proved,Firm, as the Lord of Snow uprearsHis mountains unremoved.No queen, for choking sobs and sighs,Could say her last adieu:Then Ráma bowed, with flooded eyes,And to his cot withdrew.Canto CXIII. Bharat Return.Bearing the sandals on his headAway triumphant Bharat sped,And clomb, Satrughna by his side,The car wherein he wont to ride.Before the mighty army wentThe lords for counsel eminent,Vasishtha, Vámadeva next,Jáváli, pure with prayer and text.Then from that lovely river theyTurned eastward on their homeward way:With reverent steps from left to rightThey circled Chitrakúta height,And viewed his peaks on every sideWith stains of thousand metals dyed.Then Bharat saw, not far away,Where Bharadvája dwelling lay,And when the chieftain bold and sageHad reached that holy hermitage,Down from the car he sprang to greetThe saint, and bowed before his feet.High rapture filled the hermit breast,Who thus the royal prince addressed:\"Say, Bharat, is thy duty done?Hast thou with Ráma met, my son?\"The chief whose soul to virtue claveThis answer to the hermit gave:\"I prayed him with our holy guide:But Raghu son our prayer denied,And long besought by both of usHe answered Saint Vasishtha thus:\"True to my vow, I still will beObservant of my sire decree:Till fourteen years complete their courseThat promise shall remain in force.\"The saint in highest wisdom taught,These solemn words with wisdom fraught,To him in lore of language learnedMost eloquent himself returned:\"Obey my rede: let Bharat holdThis pair of sandals decked with gold:They in Ayodhyá shall ensureOur welfare, and our bliss secure.\"When Ráma heard the royal priestHe rose, and looking to the eastConsigned the sandals to my handThat they for him might guard the land.Then from the high-souled chief abodeI turned upon my homeward road,Dismissed by him, and now this pairOf sandals to Ayodhyá bear.\"To him the hermit thus replied,By Bharat tidings gratified:\"No marvel thoughts so just and true,Thou best of all who right pursue,Should dwell in thee, O Prince of men,As waters gather in the glen.He is not dead, we mourn in vain:Thy blessed father lives again,Whose noble son we thus beholdLike Virtue self in human mould.\"He ceased: before him Bharat fellTo clasp his feet, and said farewell:His reverent steps around him bent,And onward to Ayodhyá went.His host of followers stretching farWith many an elephant and car,Waggon and steed, and mighty train,Traversed their homeward way again.O\\'er holy Yamuná they sped,Fair stream, with waves engarlanded,And then once more the rivers\\' queen,The blessed Gangá self was seen.Then making o\\'er that flood his way,Where crocodiles and monsters lay,The king to Sringavera drewHis host and royal retinue.His onward way he thence pursued,And soon renowned Ayodhyá viewed.Then burnt by woe and sad of cheerBharat addressed the charioteer:\"Ah, see, Ayodhyá dark and sad,Her glory gone, once bright and glad:Of joy and beauty reft, forlorn,In silent grief she seems to mourn.\"Canto CXIV. Bharat Departure.Deep, pleasant was the chariot soundAs royal Bharat, far renowned,Whirled by his mettled coursers fastWithin Ayodhyá city passed.There dark and drear was every homeWhere cats and owls had space to roam,As when the shades of midnight fallWith blackest gloom, and cover all:As Rohiní, dear spouse of himWhom Ráhu hates,(396) grows faint and dim,When, as she shines on high aloneThe demon shade is o\\'er her thrown:As burnt by summer heat a rillScarce trickling from her parent hill,With dying fish in pools half dried,And fainting birds upon her side:As sacrificial flames ariseWhen holy oil their food supplies,But when no more the fire is fedSink lustreless and cold and dead:Like some brave host that filled the plain,With harness rent and captains slain,When warrior, elephant, and steedMingled in wild confusion bleed:As when, all spent her store of worth,Rocks from her base the loosened earth:Like a sad fallen star no moreWearing the lovely light it wore:So mournful in her lost estateWas that sad town disconsolate.Then car-borne Bharat, good and brave,Thus spake to him the steeds who drave:\"Why are Ayodhyá streets so mute?Where is the voice of lyre and lute?Why sounds not, as of old, to-dayThe music of the minstrel lay?Where are the wreaths they used to twine?Where are the blossoms and the wine?Where is the cool refreshing scentOf sandal dust with aloe blent?The elephant impatient roar,The din of cars, I hear no more:No more the horse pleasant neighRings out to meet me on my way.Ayodhyá youths, since Ráma flight,Have lost their relish for delight:Her men roam forth no more, nor careBright garlands round their necks to wear.All grieve for banished Ráma: feast,And revelry and song have ceased:Like a black night when floods pour down,So dark and gloomy is the town.When will he come to make them gayLike some auspicious holiday?When will my brother, like a cloudAt summer close, make glad the crowd?\"Then through the streets the hero rode,And passed within his sire abode,Like some deserted lion den,Forsaken by the lord of men.Then to the inner bowers he came,Once happy home of many a dame,Now gloomy, sad, and drear,Dark as of old that sunless dayWhen wept the Gods in wild dismay;(397)There poured he many a tear.Canto CXV. Nandigrám.(398)Then when the pious chief had seenLodged in her home each widowed queen,Still with his burning grief oppressedHis holy guides he thus addressed:\"I go to Nandigrám: adieu,This day, my lords to all of you:I go, my load of grief to bear,Reft of the son of Raghu, there.The king my sire, alas, is dead,And Ráma to the forest fled;There will I wait till he, restored,Shall rule the realm, its rightful lord.\"They heard the high-souled prince speech,And thus with ready answer eachOf those great lords their chief addressed,With saint Vasishtha and the rest:\"Good are the words which thou hast said,By brotherly affection led,Like thine own self, a faithful friend,True to thy brother to the end:A heart like thine must all approve,Which naught from virtue path can move.\"Soon as the words he loved to hearFell upon Bharat joyful ear,Thus to the charioteer he spoke:\"My car with speed, Sumantra, yoke.\"Then Bharat with delighted mienObeisance paid to every queen,And with Satrughna by his sideMounting the car away he hied.With lords, and priests in long arrayThe brothers hastened on their way.And the great pomp the Bráhmans ledWith Saint Vasishtha at their head.Then every face was eastward bentAs on to Nandigrám they went.Behind the army followed, allUnsummoned by their leader call,And steeds and elephants and menStreamed forth with every citizen.As Bharat in his chariot rodeHis heart with love fraternal glowed,And with the sandals on his headTo Nandigrám he quickly sped.Within the town he swiftly pressed,Alighted, and his guides addressed:\"To me in trust my brother handConsigned the lordship of the land,When he these gold-wrought sandals gaveAs emblems to protect and save.\"Then Bharat bowed, and from his headThe sacred pledge deposited,And thus to all the people criedWho ringed him round on every side:\"Haste, for these sandals quickly bringThe canopy that shades the king.Pay ye to them all reverence meetAs to my elder brother feet,For they will right and law maintainUntil King Ráma come again.My brother with a loving mindThese sandals to my charge consigned:I till he come will guard with careThe sacred trust for Raghu heir.My watchful task will soon be done,The pledge restored to Raghu son;Then shall I see, his wanderings o\\'er,These sandals on his feet once more.My brother I shall meet at last,The burthen from my shoulders cast,To Ráma hand the realm restoreAnd serve my elder as before.When Ráma takes again this pairOf sandals kept with pious care,And here his glorious reign begins,I shall be cleansed from all my sins,When the glad people voices ringWith welcome to the new-made king,Joy will be mine four-fold as greatAs if supreme I ruled the state.\"Thus humbly spoke in sad lamentThe chief in fame preëminent:Thus, by his reverent lords obeyed,At Nandigrám the kingdom swayed.With hermit dress and matted hairHe dwelt with all his army there.The sandals of his brother feetInstalled upon the royal seat,He, all his powers to them referred,Affairs of state administered.In every care, in every task,When golden store was brought,He first, as though their rede to ask,Those royal sandals sought.Canto CXVI. The Hermit Speech.When Bharat took his homeward roadStill Ráma in the wood abode:But soon he marked the fear and careThat darkened all the hermits there.For all who dwelt before the hillWere sad with dread of coming ill:Each holy brow was lined by thought,And Ráma side they often sought.With gathering frowns the prince they eyed,And then withdrew and talked aside.Then Raghu son with anxious breastThe leader of the saints addressed:\"Can aught that I have done displease,O reverend Sage, the devotees?Why are their loving looks, O say,Thus sadly changed or turned away?Has Lakshman through his want of heedOffended with unseemly deed?Or is the gentle Sítá, sheWho loved to honour you and me--Is she the cause of this offence,Failing in lowly reverence?\"One sage, o\\'er whom, exceeding old,Had many a year of penance rolled,Trembling in every aged limbThus for the rest replied to him:\"How could we, O beloved, blameThy lofty-souled Videhan dame,Who in the good of all delights,And more than all of anchorites?But yet through thee a numbing dreadOf fiends among our band has spread;Obstructed by the demons\\' artThe trembling hermits talk apart.For Rávan brother, overbold,Named Khara, of gigantic mould,Vexes with fury fierce and fellAll those in Janasthán(399) who dwell.Resistless in his cruel deeds,On flesh of men the monster feeds:Sinful and arrogant is he,And looks with special hate on thee.Since thou, beloved son, hast madeThy home within this holy shade,The fiends have vexed with wilder rageThe dwellers of the hermitage.In many a wild and dreadful formAround the trembling saints they swarm,With hideous shape and foul disguiseThey terrify our holy eyes.They make our loathing souls endureInsult and scorn and sights impure,And flocking round the altars stayThe holy rites we love to pay.In every spot throughout the groveWith evil thoughts the monsters rove,Assailing with their secret mightEach unsuspecting anchorite.Ladle and dish away they fling,Our fires with floods extinguishing,And when the sacred flame should burnThey trample on each water-urn.Now when they see their sacred woodPlagued by this impious brotherhood,The troubled saints away would roamAnd seek in other shades a home:Hence will we fly, O Ráma, ereThe cruel fiends our bodies tear.Not far away a forest liesRich in the roots and fruit we prize,To this will I and all repairAnd join the holy hermits there;Be wise, and with us thither fleeBefore this Khara injure thee.Mighty art thou, O Ráma, yetEach day with peril is beset.If with thy consort by thy sideThou in this wood wilt still abide.\"He ceased: the words the hero spakeThe hermit purpose failed to break:To Raghu son farewell he said,And blessed the chief and comforted;Then with the rest the holy sageDeparted from the hermitage.So from the wood the saints withdrew,And Ráma bidding all adieuIn lowly reverence bent:Instructed by their friendly speech,Blest with the gracious love of each,To his pure home he went.Nor would the son of Raghu strayA moment from that grove awayFrom which the saints had fled.And many a hermit thither cameAttracted by his saintly fameAnd the pure life he led.Canto CXVII. Anasúyá.But dwelling in that lonely spotLeft by the hermits pleased him not.\"I met the faithful Bharat here,The townsmen, and my mother dear:The painful memory lingers yet,And stings me with a vain regret.And here the host of Bharat camped,And many a courser here has stamped,And elephants with ponderous feetHave trampled through the calm retreat.\"So forth to seek a home he hied,His spouse and Lakshman by his side.He came to Atri pure retreat,Paid reverence to his holy feet,And from the saint such welcome wonAs a fond father gives his son.The noble prince with joy unfeignedAs a dear guest he entertained,And cheered the glorious Lakshman tooAnd Sítá with observance due.Then Anasúyá at the callOf him who sought the good of all,His blameless venerable spouse,Delighting in her holy vows,Came from her chamber to his side:To her the virtuous hermit cried:\"Receive, I pray, with friendly graceThis dame of Maithil monarchs\\' race:\"To Ráma next made known his wife,The devotee of saintliest life:\"Ten thousand years this votaress bentOn sternest rites of penance spent;She when the clouds withheld their rain,And drought ten years consumed the plain,Caused grateful roots and fruit to growAnd ordered Gangá here to flow:So from their cares the saints she freed,Nor let these checks their rites impede,She wrought in Heaven behalf, and madeTen nights of one, the Gods to aid:(400)Let holy Anasúyá beAn honoured mother, Prince, to thee.Let thy Videhan spouse draw nearTo her whom all that live revere,Stricken in years, whose loving mindIs slow to wrath and ever kind.\"He ceased: and Ráma gave assent,And said, with eyes on Sítá bent:\"O Princess, thou hast heard with meThis counsel of the devotee:Now that her touch thy soul may bless,Approach the saintly votaress:Come to the venerable dame,Far known by Anasúyá name:The mighty things that she has doneHigh glory in the world have won.\"Thus spoke the son of Raghu: sheApproached the saintly devotee,Who with her white locks, old and frail,Shook like a plantain in the gale.To that true spouse she bowed her head,And \"Lady, I am Sítá,\" said:Raised suppliant hands and prayed her tellThat all was prosperous and well.The aged matron, when she sawFair Sítá true to duty law,Addressed her thus: \"High fate is thineWhose thoughts to virtue still incline.Thou, lady of the noble mind,Hast kin and state and wealth resignedTo follow Ráma forced to treadWhere solitary woods are spread.Those women gain high spheres aboveWho still unchanged their husbands love,Whether they dwell in town or wood,Whether their hearts be ill or good.Though wicked, poor, or led awayIn love forbidden paths to stray,The noble matron still will deemHer lord a deity supreme.Regarding kin and friendship, ICan see no better, holier tie,And every penance-rite is dimBeside the joy of serving him.But dark is this to her whose mindPromptings of idle fancy blind,Who led by evil thoughts awayMakes him who should command obey.Such women, O dear Maithil dame,Their virtue lose and honest fame,Enslaved by sin and folly, ledIn these unholy paths to tread.But they who good and true like theeThe present and the future see,Like men by holy deeds will riseTo mansions in the blissful skies.So keep thee pure from taint of sin,Still to thy lord be true,And fame and merit shalt thou win,To thy devotion due.\"Canto CXVIII. Anasúyá Gifts.Thus by the holy dame addressedWho banished envy from her breast,Her lowly reverence Sítá paid,And softly thus her answer made:\"No marvel, best of dames, thy speechThe duties of a wife should teach;Yet I, O lady, also knowDue reverence to my lord to show.Were he the meanest of the base,Unhonoured with a single grace,My husband still I ne\\'er would leave,But firm through all to him would cleave:Still rather to a lord like mineWhose virtues high-exalted shine,Compassionate, of lofty soul,With every sense in due control,True in his love, of righteous mind,Like a dear sire and mother kind.E\\'en as he ever loves to treatKausalyá with observance meet,Has his behaviour ever beenTo every other honoured queen.Nay, more, a sonlike reverence showsThe noble Ráma e\\'en to thoseOn whom the king his father setHis eyes one moment, to forget.Deep in my heart the words are stored,Said by the mother of my lord,When from my home I turned awayIn the lone fearful woods to stray.The counsel of my mother deepImpressed upon my soul I keep,When by the fire I took my stand,And Ráma clasped in his my hand.And in my bosom cherished yet,My friends\\' advice I ne\\'er forget:Woman her holiest offering paysWhen she her husband will obeys.Good Sávitrí her lord obeyed,And a high saint in heaven was made,And for the self-same virtue thouHast heaven in thy possession now.And she with whom no dame could vie,Now a bright Goddess in the sky,Sweet Rohiní the Moon dear Queen,Without her lord is never seen:And many a faithful wife besideFor her pure love is glorified.\"Thus Sítá spake: soft rapture stoleThrough Anasúyá saintly soul:Kisses on Sítá head she pressed,And thus the Maithil dame addressed:\"I by long rites and toils enduredRich store of merit have secured:From this my wealth will I bestowA blessing ere I let thee go.So right and wise and true each wordThat from thy lips mine ears have heard,I love thee: be my pleasing taskTo grant the boon that thou shalt ask.\"Then Sítá marvelled much, and whilePlayed o\\'er her lips a gentle smile,\"All has been done, O Saint,\" she cried,\"And naught remains to wish beside.\"She spake; the lady meek replySwelled Anasúyá rapture high.\"Sítá,\" she said, \"my gift to-dayThy sweet contentment shall repay.Accept this precious robe to wear,Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare,These gems thy limbs to ornament,This precious balsam sweet of scent.O Maithil dame, this gift of mineShall make thy limbs with beauty shine,And breathing o\\'er thy frame dispenseIts pure and lasting influence.This balsam on thy fair limbs spreadNew radiance on thy lord shall shed,As Lakshmí beauty lends a graceTo Vishnu own celestial face.\"Then Sítá took the gift the dameBestowed on her in friendship name,The balsam, gems, and robe divine,And garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;Then sat her down, with reverence meet,At saintly Anasúyá feet.The matron rich in rites and vowsTurned her to Ráma Maithil spouse,And questioned thus in turn to hearA pleasant tale to charm her ear:\"Sítá, \\'tis said that Raghu sonThy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.I fain would hear thee, lady, tellThe story as it all befell:Do thou repeat each thing that passed,Reviewing all from first to last.\"Thus spake the dame to Sítá: sheReplying to the devotee,\"Then, lady, thy attention lend,\"Rehearsed the story to the end:\"King Janak, just and brave and strong,Who loves the right and hates the wrong,Well skilled in what the law ordainsFor Warriors, o\\'er Videha reigns.Guiding one morn the plough, his handMarked out, for rites the sacred land,When, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,Child of the king I leapt to birth.Then as the ground he smoothed and cleared,He saw me all with dust besmeared,And on the new-found babe, amazedThe ruler of Videha gazed.In childless love the monarch pressedThe welcome infant to his breast:\"My daughter,\" thus he cried, \"is she:\"And as his child he cared for me.Forth from the sky was heard o\\'erheadAs \\'twere a human voice that said:\"Yea, even so: great King, this childHenceforth thine own be justly styled.\"Videha monarch, virtuous souled,Rejoiced o\\'er me with joy untold,Delighting in his new-won prize,The darling of his heart and eyes.To his chief queen of saintly mindThe precious treasure he consigned,And by her side she saw me grow,Nursed with the love which mothers know.Then as he saw the seasons fly,And knew my marriage-time was nigh,My sire was vexed with care, as sadAs one who mourns the wealth he had:\"Scorn on the maiden sire must waitFrom men of high and low estate:The virgin father all despise,Though Indra peer, who rules the skies.\"More near he saw, and still more near,The scorn that filled his soul with fear,On trouble billowy ocean tossed,Like one whose shattered bark is lost.My father knowing how I came,No daughter of a mortal dame,In all the regions failed to seeA bridegroom meet to match with me.Each way with anxious thought he scanned,And thus at length the monarch planned:\"The Bride Election will I hold,With every rite prescribed of old.\"It pleased King Varun to bestowQuiver and shafts and heavenly bowUpon my father sire who reigned,When Daksha his great rite ordained.Where was the man might bend or liftWith utmost toil that wondrous gift?Not e\\'en in dreams could mortal kingStrain the great bow or draw the string.Of this tremendous bow possessed,My truthful father thus addressedThe lords of many a region, allAssembled at the monarch call:\"Whoe\\'er this bow can manage, heThe husband of my child shall be.\"The suitors viewed with hopeless eyesThat wondrous bow of mountain size,Then to my sire they bade adieu,And all with humbled hearts withdrew.At length with Visvámitra cameThis son of Raghu, dear to fame,The royal sacrifice to view.Near to my father home he drew,His brother Lakshman by his side,Ráma, in deeds heroic tried.My sire with honour entertainedThe saint in lore of duty trained,Who thus in turn addressed the king:\"Ráma and Lakshman here who springFrom royal Dasaratha, longTo see thy bow so passing strong.\"Before the prince eyes was laidThat marvel, as the Bráhman prayed.One moment on the bow he gazed,Quick to the notch the string he raised,Then, in the wandering people view,The cord with mighty force he drew.Then with an awful crash as loudAs thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,The bow beneath the matchless strainOf arms heroic snapped in twain.Thus, giving purest water, he,My sire, to Ráma offered me.The prince the offered gift declinedTill he should learn his father mind;So horsemen swift Ayodhyá soughtAnd back her aged monarch brought.Me then my sire to Ráma gave,Self-ruled, the bravest of the brave.And Urmilá, the next to me,Graced with all gifts, most fair to see,My sire with Raghu house allied,And gave her to be Lakshman bride.Thus from the princes of the landLord Ráma won my maiden hand,And him exalted high aboveHeroic chiefs I truly love.\"Canto CXIX. The Forest.When Anasúyá, virtuous-souled,Had heard the tale by Sítá told,She kissed the lady brow and lacedHer loving arms around her waist.\"With sweet-toned words distinct and clearThy pleasant tale has charmed mine ear,How the great king thy father heldThat Maiden Choice unparalleled.But now the sun has sunk from sight,And left the world to holy Night.Hark! how the leafy thickets soundWith gathering birds that twitter round:They sought their food by day, and allFlock homeward when the shadows fall.See, hither comes the hermit band,Each with his pitcher in his hand:Fresh from the bath, their locks are wet,Their coats of bark are dripping yet.Here saints their fires of worship tend,And curling wreaths of smoke ascend:Borne on the flames they mount above,Dark as the brown wings of the dove.The distant trees, though well-nigh bare,Gloom thickened by the evening air,And in the faint uncertain lightShut the horizon from our sight.The beasts that prowl in darkness roveOn every side about the grove,And the tame deer, at ease reclinedTheir shelter near the altars find.The night o\\'er all the sky is spread,With lunar stars engarlanded,And risen in his robes of lightThe moon is beautifully bright.Now to thy lord I bid thee go:Thy pleasant tale has charmed me so:One thing alone I needs must pray,Before me first thyself array:Here in thy heavenly raiment shine,And glad, dear love, these eyes of mine.\"Then like a heavenly Goddess shoneFair Sítá with that raiment on.She bowed her to the matron feet,Then turned away her lord to meet.The hero prince with joy surveyedHis Sítá in her robes arrayed,As glorious to his arms she cameWith love-gifts of the saintly dame.She told him how the saint to showHer fond affection would bestowThat garland of celestial twine,Those ornaments and robes divine.Then Ráma heart, nor Lakshman less,Was filled with pride and happiness,For honours high had Sítá gained,Which mortal dames have scarce obtained.There honoured by each pious sageWho dwelt within the hermitage,Beside his darling well contentThat sacred night the hero spent.The princes, when the night had fled,Farewell to all the hermits said,Who gazed upon the distant shade,Their lustral rites and offerings paid.The saints who made their dwelling thereIn words like these addressed the pair:\"O Princes, monsters fierce and fellAround that distant forest dwell:On blood from human veins they feed,And various forms assume at need,With savage beasts of fearful powerThat human flesh and blood devour.Our holy saints they rend and tearWhen met alone or unaware,And eat them in their cruel joy:These chase, O Ráma, or destroy.By this one path our hermits goTo fetch the fruits that yonder grow:By this, O Prince, thy feet should strayThrough pathless forests far away.\"Thus by the reverent saints addressed,And by their prayers auspicious blessed,He left the holy crowd:His wife and brother by his side,Within the mighty wood he hied.So sinks the Day-God in his prideBeneath a bank of cloud.',\n",
       " 'BOOK 3': 'Canto I. The Hermitage.When Ráma, valiant hero, stoodIn the vast shade of Dandak wood,His eyes on every side he bentAnd saw a hermit settlement,Where coats of bark were hung around,And holy grass bestrewed the ground.Bright with Bráhmanic lustre glowedThat circle where the saints abode:Like the hot sun in heaven it shone,Too dazzling to be looked upon.Wild creatures found a refuge whereThe court, well-swept, was bright and fair,And countless birds and roedeer madeTheir dwelling in the friendly shade.Beneath the boughs of well-loved treesOft danced the gay Apsarases.(401)Around was many an ample shedWherein the holy fire was fed;With sacred grass and skins of deer,Ladles and sacrificial gear,And roots and fruit, and wood to burn,And many a brimming water-urn.Tall trees their hallowed branches spread,Laden with pleasant fruit, o\\'erhead;And gifts which holy laws require,(402)And solemn offerings burnt with fire,(403)And Veda chants on every sideThat home of hermits sanctified.There many a flower its odour shed,And lotus blooms the lake o\\'erspred.There, clad in coats of bark and hide,--Their food by roots and fruit supplied,--Dwelt many an old and reverend sireBright as the sun or Lord of Fire,All with each worldly sense subdued,A pure and saintly multitude.The Veda chants, the saints who trodThe sacred ground and mused on God,Made that delightful grove appearLike Brahmá own most glorious sphere.As Raghu splendid son surveyedThat hermit home and tranquil shade,He loosed his mighty bow-string, thenDrew nearer to the holy men.With keen celestial sight enduedThose mighty saints the chieftain viewed,With joy to meet the prince they came,And gentle Sítá dear to fame.They looked on virtuous Ráma, fairAs Soma(404) in the evening air,And Lakshman by his brother side,And Sítá long in duty tried,And with glad blessings every sageReceived them in the hermitage.Then Ráma form and stature tallEntranced the wondering eyes of all,--His youthful grace, his strength of limb,And garb that nobly sat on him.To Lakshman too their looks they raised,And upon Sítá beauty gazedWith eyes that closed not lest their sightShould miss the vision of delight.Then the pure hermits of the wood,Rejoicing in all creatures\\' good,Their guest, the glorious Ráma, ledWithin a cot with leaves o\\'erhead.With highest honour all the bestOf radiant saints received their guest,With kind observance, as is meet,And gave him water for his feet.To highest pitch of rapture wroughtTheir stores of roots and fruit they brought.They poured their blessings on his head,And \"All we have is thine,\" they said.Then, reverent hand to hand applied,(405)Each duty-loving hermit cried:\"The king is our protector, brightIn fame, maintainer of the right.He bears the awful sword, and henceDeserves an elder reverence.One fourth of Indra essence, hePreserves his realm from danger free,Hence honoured by the world of rightThe king enjoys each choice delight.Thou shouldst to us protection give,For in thy realm, dear lord, we live:Whether in town or wood thou be,Thou art our king, thy people we.Our wordly aims are laid aside,Our hearts are tamed and purified.To thee our guardian, we who earnOur only wealth by penance turn.\"Then the pure dwellers in the shadeTo Raghu son due honour paid,And Lakshman, bringing store of roots,And many a flower, and woodland fruits.And others strove the prince to pleaseWith all attentive courtesies.Canto II. Virádha.Thus entertained he passed the night,Then, with the morning early light,To all the hermits bade adieuAnd sought his onward way anew.He pierced the mighty forest whereRoamed many a deer and pard and bear:Its ruined pools he scarce could see.For creeper rent and prostrate tree,Where shrill cicada cries were heard,And plaintive notes of many a bird.Deep in the thickets of the woodWith Lakshman and his spouse he stood,There in the horrid shade he sawA giant passing nature law:Vast as some mountain-peak in size,With mighty voice and sunken eyes,Huge, hideous, tall, with monstrous face,Most ghastly of his giant race.A tiger hide the Rákshas woreStill reeking with the fat and gore:Huge-faced, like Him who rules the dead,All living things he struck with dread.Three lions, tigers four, ten deerHe carried on his iron spear,Two wolves, an elephant head besideWith mighty tusks which blood-drops dyed.When on the three his fierce eye fell,He charged them with a roar and yellAs furious as the grisly KingWhen stricken worlds are perishing.Then with a mighty roar that shookThe earth beneath their feet, he tookThe trembling Sítá to his side.Withdrew a little space, and cried:\"Ha, short lived wretches, ye who dare,In hermit dress with matted hair,Armed each with arrows, sword, and bow,Through Dandak pathless wood to go:How with one dame, I bid you tell,Can you among ascetics dwell?Who are ye, sinners, who despiseThe right, in holy men disguise?The great Virádha, day by dayThrough this deep-tangled wood I stray,And ever, armed with trusty steel,I seize a saint to make my meal.This woman young and fair of frameShall be the conquering giant dame:Your blood, ye things of evil life,My lips shall quaff in battle strife.\"He spoke: and Janak hapless child,Scared by his speech so fierce and wild,Trembled for terror, as a frailYoung plantain shivers in the gale.When Ráma saw Virádha claspFair Sítá in his mighty grasp,Thus with pale lips that terror driedThe hero to his brother cried:\"O see Virádha arm enfoldMy darling in its cursed hold,--The child of Janak best of kings,My spouse whose soul to virtue clings,Sweet princess, with pure glory bright,Nursed in the lap of soft delight.Now falls the blow Kaikeyí meant,Successful in her dark intent:This day her cruel soul will beTriumphant over thee and me.Though Bharat on the throne is set,Her greedy eyes look farther yet:Me from my home she dared expel,Me whom all creatures loved so well.This fatal day at length, I ween,Brings triumph to the younger queen.I see with bitterest grief and shameAnother touch the Maithil dame.Not loss of sire and royal powerSo grieves me as this mournful hour.\"Thus in his anguish cried the chief:Then drowned in tears, o\\'erwhelmed by grief,Thus Lakshman in his anger spake,Quick panting like a spell-bound snake:\"Canst thou, my brother, Indra peer,When I thy minister am near,Thus grieve like some forsaken thing,Thou, every creature lord and king?My vengeful shaft the fiend shall slay,And earth shall drink his blood to-day.The fury which my soul at firstUpon usurping Bharat nursed,On this Virádha will I wreakAs Indra splits the mountain peak.Winged by this arm impetuous mightMy shaft with deadly forceThe monster in the chest shall smite,And fell his shattered corse.\"Canto III. Virádha Attacked.Virádha with a fearful shoutThat echoed through the wood, cried out:\"What men are ye, I bid you say,And whither would ye bend your way?\"To him whose mouth shot fiery flameThe hero told his race and name:\"Two Warriors, nobly bred, are we,And through this wood we wander free.But who art thou, how born and styled,Who roamest here in Dandak wild?\"To Ráma, bravest of the brave,His answer thus Virádha gave:\"Hear, Raghu son, and mark me well,And I my name and race will tell.Of Satahradá born, I springFrom Java as my sire, O King:Me, of this lofty lineage, allGiants on earth Virádha call.The rites austere I long maintainedFrom Brahmá grace the boon have gainedTo bear a charmed frame which ne\\'erWeapon or shaft may pierce or tear.Go as ye came, untouched by fear,And leave with me this woman here:Go, swiftly from my presence fly,Or by this hand ye both shall die.\"Then Ráma with his fierce eyes redWith fury to the giant said:\"Woe to thee, sinner, fond and weak,Who madly thus thy death wilt seek!Stand, for it waits thee in the fray:With life thou ne\\'er shalt flee away.\"He spoke, and raised the cord whereonA pointed arrow flashed and shone,Then, wild with anger, from his bow,He launched the weapon on the foe.Seven times the fatal cord he drew,And forth seven rapid arrows flew,Shafts winged with gold that left the windAnd e\\'en Suparna(406) self behind.Full on the giant breast they smote,And purpled like the peacock throat,Passed through his mighty bulk and cameTo earth again like flakes of flame.The fiend the Maithil dame unclasped;In his fierce hand his spear he grasped,And wild with rage, pierced through and through,At Ráma and his brother flew.So loud the roar which chilled with fear,So massy was the monster spear,He seemed, like Indra flagstaff, dreadAs the dark God who rules the dead.On huge Virádha fierce as He(407)Who smites, and worlds have ceased to be,The princely brothers poured amainTheir fiery flood of arrowy rain.Unmoved he stood, and opening wideHis dire mouth laughed unterrified,And ever as the monster gapedThose arrows from his jaws escaped.Preserving still his life unharmed,By Brahmá saving promise charmed,His mighty spear aloft in airHe raised, and rushed upon the pair.From Ráma bow two arrows flewAnd cleft that massive spear in two,Dire as the flaming levin sentFrom out the cloudy firmament.Cut by the shafts he guided wellTo earth the giant weapon fell:As when from Meru summit, rivenBy fiery bolts, a rock is driven.Then swift his sword each warrior drew,Like a dread serpent black of hue,And gathering fury for the blowRushed fiercely on the giant foe.Around each prince an arm he cast,And held the dauntless heroes fast:Then, though his gashes gaped and bled,Bearing the twain he turned and fled.Then Ráma saw the giant plan,And to his brother thus began:\"O Lakshman, let Virádha stillHurry us onward as he will,For look, Sumitrá son, he goesAlong the path we freely chose.\"He spoke: the rover of the nightUpraised them with terrific might,Till, to his lofty shoulders swung,Like children to his neck they clung.Then sending far his fearful roar,The princes through the wood he bore,--A wood like some vast cloud to view,Where birds of every plumage flew,And mighty trees o\\'erarching threwDark shadows on the ground;Where snakes and silvan creatures madeTheir dwelling, and the jackal strayedThrough tangled brakes around.Canto IV. Virádha Death.But Sítá viewed with wild affrightThe heroes hurried from her sight.She tossed her shapely arms on high,And shrieked aloud her bitter cry:\"Ah, the dread giant bears awayThe princely Ráma as his prey,Truthful and pure, and good and great,And Lakshman shares his brother fate.The brindled tiger and the bearMy mangled limbs for food will tear.Take me, O best of giants, me,And leave the sons of Raghu free.\"Then, by avenging fury spurred,Her mournful cry the heroes heard,And hastened, for the lady sake,The wicked monster life to take.Then Lakshman with resistless strokeThe foe left arm that held him broke,And Ráma too, as swift to smite,Smashed with his heavy hand the right.With broken arms and tortured frameTo earth the fainting giant came,Like a huge cloud, or mighty rockRent, sundered by the levin shock.Then rushed they on, and crushed and beatTheir foe with arms and fists and feet,And nerved each mighty limb to poundAnd bray him on the level ground.Keen arrows and each biting bladeWide rents in breast and side had made;But crushed and torn and mangled, stillThe monster lived they could not kill.When Ráma saw no arms might slayThe fiend who like a mountain lay,The glorious hero, swift to saveIn danger, thus his counsel gave:\"O Prince of men, his charmed lifeNo arms may take in battle strife:Now dig we in this grove a pitHis elephantine bulk to fit,And let the hollowed earth enfoldThe monster of gigantic mould.\"This said, the son of Raghu pressedHis foot upon the giant breast.With joy the prostrate monster heardVictorious Ráma welcome word,And straight Kakutstha son, the bestOf men, in words like these addressed:\"I yield, O chieftain, overthrownBy might that vies with Indra own.Till now my folly-blinded eyesThee, hero, failed to recognize.Happy Kausalyá! blest to beThe mother of a son like thee!I know thee well, O chieftain, now:Ráma, the prince of men, art thou.There stands the high-born Maithil dame,There Lakshman, lord of mighty fame.My name was Tumburu,(408) for songRenowned among the minstrel throng:Cursed by Kuvera stern decreeI wear the hideous shape you see.But when I sued, his grace to crave,The glorious God this answer gave:\"When Ráma, Dasaratha son,Destroys thee and the fight is won,Thy proper shape once more assume,And heaven again shall give thee room.\"When thus the angry God replied,No prayers could turn his wrath aside,And thus on me his fury fellFor loving Rambhá(409) charms too well.Now through thy favour am I freedFrom the stern fate the God decreed,And saved, O tamer of the foe,By thee, to heaven again shall go.A league, O Prince, beyond this spotStands holy Sarabhanga cot:The very sun is not more brightThan that most glorious anchorite:To him, O Ráma, quickly turn,And blessings from the hermit earn.First under earth my body throw,Then on thy way rejoicing go.Such is the law ordained of oldFor giants when their days are told:Their bodies laid in earth, they riseTo homes eternal in the skies.\"Thus, by the rankling dart oppressed,Kakutstha offspring he addressed:In earth his mighty body lay,His spirit fled to heaven away.Thus spake Virádha ere he died;And Ráma to his brother cried:\"Now dig we in this grove a pitHis elephantine bulk to fit.And let the hollowed earth enfoldThis mighty giant fierce and bold.\"This said, the valiant hero putUpon the giant neck his foot.His spade obedient Lakshman plied,And dug a pit both deep and wideBy lofty souled Virádha side.Then Raghu son his foot withdrew,And down the mighty form they threw;One awful shout of joy he gaveAnd sank into the open grave.The heroes, to their purpose true,In fight the cruel demon slew,And radiant with delightDeep in the hollowed earth they castThe monster roaring to the last,In their resistless might.Thus when they saw the warrior steelNo life-destroying blow might deal,The pair, for lore renowned,Deep in the pit their hands had madeThe unresisting giant laid,And killed him neath the ground.Upon himself the monster broughtFrom Ráma hand the death he soughtWith strong desire to gain:And thus the rover of the nightTold Ráma, as they strove in fight,That swords might rend and arrows smiteUpon his breast in vain.Thus Ráma, when his speech he heard,The giant mighty form interred,Which mortal arms defied.With thundering crash the giant fell,And rock and cave and forest dellWith echoing roar replied.The princes, when their task was doneAnd freedom from the peril won,Rejoiced to see him die.Then in the boundless wood they strayed,Like the great sun and moon displayedTriumphant in the sky.(410)Canto V. Sarabhanga.Then Ráma, having slain in fightVirádha of terrific might,With gentle words his spouse consoled,And clasped her in his loving hold.Then to his brother nobly braveThe valiant prince his counsel gave:\"Wild are these woods around us spread;And hard and rough the ground to tread:We, O my brother, ne\\'er have viewedSo dark and drear a solitude:To Sarabhanga let us haste,Whom wealth of holy works has graced.\"Thus Ráma spoke, and took the roadTo Sarabhanga pure abode.But near that saint whose lustre viedWith Gods, by penance purified,With startled eyes the prince beheldA wondrous sight unparalleled.In splendour like the fire and sunHe saw a great and glorious one.Upon a noble car he rode,And many a God behind him glowed:And earth beneath his feet unpressed(411)The monarch of the skies confessed.Ablaze with gems, no dust might dimThe bright attire that covered him.Arrayed like him, on every sideHigh saints their master glorified.Near, borne in air, appeared in viewHis car which tawny coursers drew,Like silver cloud, the moon, or sunEre yet the day is well begun.Wreathed with gay garlands, o\\'er his headA pure white canopy was spread,And lovely nymphs stood nigh to holdFair chouris with their sticks of gold,Which, waving in each gentle hand,The forehead of their monarch fanned.God, saint, and bard, a radiant ring,Sang glory to their heavenly King:Forth into joyful lauds they burstAs Indra with the sage conversed.Then Ráma, when his wondering eyesBeheld the monarch of the skies,To Lakshman quickly called, and showedThe car wherein Lord Indra rode:\"See, brother, see that air-borne car,Whose wondrous glory shines afar:Wherefrom so bright a lustre streamsThat like a falling sun it seems:These are the steeds whose fame we know,Of heavenly race through heaven they go:These are the steeds who bear the yokeOf Sakra,(412) Him whom all invoke.Behold these youths, a glorious band,Toward every wind a hundred stand:A sword in each right hand is borne,And rings of gold their arms adorn.What might in every broad deep chestAnd club-like arm is manifest!Clothed in attire of crimson hueThey show like tigers fierce to view.Great chains of gold each warder deck,Gleaming like fire beneath his neck.The age of each fair youth appearsSome score and five of human years:The ever-blooming prime which theyWho live in heaven retain for aye:Such mien these lordly beings wear,Heroic youths, most bright and fair.Now, brother, in this spot, I pray,With the Videhan lady stay,Till I have certain knowledge whoThis being is, so bright to view.\"He spoke, and turning from the spotSought Sarabhanga hermit cot.But when the lord of Sachí(413) sawThe son of Raghu near him draw,He hastened of the sage to takeHis leave, and to his followers spake:\"See, Ráma bends his steps this way,But ere he yet a word can say,Come, fly to our celestial sphere;It is not meet he see me here.Soon victor and triumphant heIn fitter time shall look on me.Before him still a great emprise,A task too hard for others, lies.\"Then with all marks of honour highThe Thunderer bade the saint good-bye,And in his car which coursers drewAway to heaven the conqueror flew.Then Ráma, Lakshman, and the dame,To Sarabhanga nearer came,Who sat beside the holy flame.Before the ancient sage they bent,And clasped his feet most reverent;Then at his invitation foundA seat beside him on the ground.Then Ráma prayed the sage would deignLord Indra visit to explain;And thus at length the holy manIn answer to his prayer began:\"This Lord of boons has sought me hereTo waft me hence to Brahmá sphere,Won by my penance long and stern,--A home the lawless ne\\'er can earn.But when I knew that thou wast nigh,To Brahmá world I could not flyUntil these longing eyes were blestWith seeing thee, mine honoured guest.Since thou, O Prince, hast cheered my sight,Great-hearted lover of the right,To heavenly spheres will I repairAnd bliss supreme that waits me there.For I have won, dear Prince, my wayTo those fair worlds which ne\\'er decay,Celestial seat of Brahmá reign:Be thine, with me, those worlds to gain.\"Then master of all sacred lore,Spake Ráma to the saint once more:\"I, even I, illustrious sage,Will make those worlds mine heritage:But now, I pray, some home assignWithin this holy grove of thine.\"Thus Ráma, Indra peer in might,Addressed the aged anchorite:And he, with wisdom well endued,To Raghu son his speech renewed:\"Sutíkshna woodland home is near,A glorious saint of life austere,True to the path of duty; heWith highest bliss will prosper thee.Against the stream thy course must beOf this fair brook Mandákiní,Whereon light rafts like blossoms glide;Then to his cottage turn aside.There lies thy path: but ere thou go,Look on me, dear one, till I throwAside this mould that girds me in,As casts the snake his withered skin.\"He spoke, the fire in order laidWith holy oil due offerings made,And Sarabhanga, glorious sire,Laid down his body in the fire.Then rose the flame above his head,On skin, blood, flesh, and bones it fed,Till forth, transformed, with radiant hueOf tender youth, he rose anew,Far-shining in his bright attireCame Sarabhanga from the pyre:Above the home of saints, and thoseWho feed the quenchless flame,(414) he rose:Beyond the seat of Gods he passed,And Brahmá sphere was gained at last.The noblest of the twice-born race,For holy works supreme in place,The Mighty Father there beheldGirt round by hosts unparalleled;And Brahmá joying at the sightWelcomed the glorious anchorite.Canto VI. Ráma Promise.When he his heavenly home had found,The holy men who dwelt aroundTo Ráma flocked, whose martial fameShone glorious as the kindled flame:Vaikhánasas(415) who love the wild,Pure hermits Bálakhilyas(416) styled,Good Samprakshálas,(417) saints who liveOn rays which moon and daystar give:Those who with leaves their lives sustainAnd those who pound with stones their grain:And they who lie in pools, and thoseWhose corn, save teeth, no winnow knows:Those who for beds the cold earth use,And those who every couch refuse:And those condemned to ceaseless pains,Whose single foot their weight sustains:And those who sleep neath open skies,Whose food the wave or air supplies,And hermits pure who spend their nightsOn ground prepared for sacred rites;Those who on hills their vigil hold,Or dripping clothes around them fold:The devotees who live for prayer,Or the five fires(418) unflinching bear.On contemplation all intent,With light that heavenly knowledge lent,They came to Ráma, saint and sage,In Sarabhanga hermitage.The hermit crowd around him pressed,And thus the virtuous chief addressed:\"The lordship of the earth is thine,O Prince of old Ikshváku line.Lord of the Gods is Indra, soThou art our lord and guide below.Thy name, the glory of thy might,Throughout the triple world are bright:Thy filial love so nobly shown,Thy truth and virtue well are known.To thee, O lord, for help we fly,And on thy love of right rely:With kindly patience hear us speak,And grant the boon we humbly seek.That lord of earth were most unjust,Foul traitor to his solemn trust,Who should a sixth of all(419) require,Nor guard his people like a sire.But he who ever watchful strivesTo guard his subjects\\' wealth and lives,Dear as himself or, dearer still,His sons, with earnest heart and will,--That king, O Raghu son, securesHigh fame that endless years endures,And he to Brahmá world shall rise,Made glorious in the eternal skies.Whate\\'er, by duty won, the meedOf saints whom roots and berries feed,One fourth thereof, for tender careOf subjects, is the monarch share.These, mostly of the Bráhman race,Who make the wood their dwelling-place,Although a friend in thee they view,Fall friendless neath the giant crew.Come, Ráma, come, and see hard byThe holy hermits\\' corpses lie,Where many a tangled pathway showsThe murderous work of cruel foes.These wicked fiends the hermits kill--Who live on Chitrakúta hill,And blood of slaughtered saints has dyedMandákiní and Pampá side.No longer can we bear to seeThe death of saint and devoteeWhom through the forest day by dayThese Rákshasas unpitying slay.To thee, O Prince, we flee, and craveThy guardian help our lives to save.From these fierce rovers of the nightDefend each stricken anchorite.Throughout the world \\'twere vain to seekAn arm like thine to aid the weak.O Prince, we pray thee hear our call,And from these fiends preserve us all.\"The son of Raghu heard the plaintOf penance-loving sage and saint,And the good prince his speech renewedTo all the hermit multitude:\"To me, O saints, ye need not sue:I wait the hests of all of you.I by mine own occasion ledThis mighty forest needs must tread,And while I keep my sire decreeYour lives from threatening foes will free.I hither came of free accordTo lend the aid by you implored,And richest meed my toil shall pay,While here in forest shades I stay.I long in battle strife to close.And slay these fiends, the hermits\\' foes,That saint and sage may learn arightMy prowess and my brother might.\"Thus to the saints his promise gaveThat prince who still to virtue claveWith never-wandering thought:And then with Lakshman by his side,With penance-wealthy men to guide,Sutíkshna home he sought.Canto VII. Sutíkshna.So Raghu son, his foemen dread,With Sítá and his brother sped,Girt round by many a twice-born sage,To good Sutíkshna hermitage.(420)Through woods for many a league he passed,O\\'er rushing rivers full and fast,Until a mountain fair and brightAs lofty Meru rose in sight.Within its belt of varied woodIkshváku sons and Sítá stood,Where trees of every foliage boreBlossom and fruit in endless store.There coats of bark, like garlands strung,Before a lonely cottage hung,And there a hermit, dust-besmeared,A lotus on his breast, appeared.Then Ráma with obeisance dueAddressed the sage, as near he drew:\"My name is Ráma, lord; I seekThy presence, saint, with thee to speak.O sage, whose merits ne\\'er decay,Some word unto thy servant say.\"The sage his eyes on Ráma bent,Of virtue friends preëminent;Then words like these he spoke, and pressedThe son of Raghu to his breast:\"Welcome to thee, illustrious youth,Best champion of the rights of truth!By thine approach this holy groundA worthy lord this day has found.I could not quit this mortal frameTill thou shouldst come, O dear to fame:To heavenly spheres I would not rise,Expecting thee with eager eyes.I knew that thou, unkinged, hadst madeThy home in Chitrakúta shade.E\\'en now, O Ráma, Indra, lordSupreme by all the Gods adored,King of the Hundred Offerings,(421) said,When he my dwelling visited,That the good works that I have doneMy choice of all the worlds have won.Accept this meed of holy vows,And with thy brother and thy spouse,Roam, through my favour, in the skyWhich saints celestial glorify.\"To that bright sage, of penance stern,The high-souled Ráma spake in turn,As Vásava(422) who rules the skiesTo Brahmá gracious speech replies:\"I of myself those worlds will win,O mighty hermit pure from sin:But now, O saint, I pray thee tellWhere I within this wood may dwell:For I by Sarabhanga old,The son of Gautama, was toldThat thou in every lore art wise,And seest all with loving eyes.\"Thus to the saint, whose glories highFilled all the world, he made reply:And thus again the holy manHis pleasant speech with joy began:\"This calm retreat, O Prince, is blestWith many a charm: here take thy rest.Here roots and kindly fruits abound,And hermits love the holy ground.Fair silvan beasts and gentle deerIn herds unnumbered wander here:And as they roam, secure from harm,Our eyes with grace and beauty charm:Except the beasts in thickets bred,This grove of ours has naught to dread.\"The hermit speech when Ráma heard,--The hero ne\\'er by terror stirred,--On his great bow his hand he laid,And thus in turn his answer made:\"O saint, my darts of keenest steel,Armed with their murderous barbs, would dealDestruction mid the silvan raceThat flocks around thy dwelling-place.Most wretched then my fate would beFor such dishonour shown to thee:And only for the briefest stayWould I within this grove delay.\"He spoke and ceased. With pious careHe turned him to his evening prayer,Performed each customary rite,And sought his lodging for the night,With Sítá and his brother laidBeneath the grove delightful shade,First good Sutíkshna, as elsewhere, when he sawThe shades of night around them draw,With hospitable careThe princely chieftains entertainedWith store of choicest food ordainedFor holy hermit fare.Canto VIII. The Hermitage.So Ráma and Sumitrá son,When every honour due was done,Slept through the night. When morning broke,The heroes from their rest awoke.Betimes the son of Raghu rose,With gentle Sítá, from repose,And sipped the cool delicious waveSweet with the scent the lotus gave,Then to the Gods and sacred flameThe heroes and the lady came,And bent their heads in honour meetWithin the hermit pure retreat.When every stain was purged away,They saw the rising Lord of Day:Then to Sutíkshna side they went,And softly spoke, most reverent:\"Well have we slept, O holy lord,Honoured of thee by all adored:Now leave to journey forth we pray:These hermits urge us on our way.We haste to visit, wandering by,The ascetics\\' homes that round you lie,And roaming Dandak mighty woodTo view each saintly brotherhood,For thy permission now we sue,With these high saints to duty true,By penance taught each sense to tame,--In lustre like the smokeless flame.Ere on our brows the sun can beatWith fierce intolerable heat.Like some unworthy lord who winsHis power by tyranny and sins,O saint, we fain would part.\" The threeBent humbly to the devotee.He raised the princes as they pressedHis feet, and strained them to his breast;And then the chief of devoteesBespake them both in words like these:\"Go with thy brother, Ráma, go,Pursue thy path untouched by woe:Go with thy faithful Sítá, sheStill like a shadow follows thee.Roam Dandak wood observing wellThe pleasant homes where hermits dwell,--Pure saints whose ordered souls adhereTo penance rites and vows austere.There plenteous roots and berries grow,And noble trees their blossoms show,And gentle deer and birds of airIn peaceful troops are gathered there.There see the full-blown lotus studThe bosom of the lucid flood,And watch the joyous mallard shakeThe reeds that fringe the pool and lake.See with delighted eye the rillLeap sparkling from her parent hill,And hear the woods that round thee lieReëcho to the peacock cry.And as I bid thy brother, so,Sumitrá child, I bid thee go.Go forth, these varied beauties see,And then once more return to me.\"Thus spake the sage Sutíkshna: bothThe chiefs assented, nothing loth,Round him with circling steps they paced,Then for the road prepared with haste.There Sítá stood, the dame long-eyed,Fair quivers round their waists she tied,And gave each prince his trusty bow,And sword which ne\\'er a spot might know.Each took his quiver from her hand.And clanging bow and gleaming brand:Then from the hermits\\' home the twoWent forth each woodland scene to view.Each beauteous in the bloom of age,Dismissed by that illustrious sage,With bow and sword accoutred, hiedAway, and Sítá by their side.Canto IX. Sítá Speech.Blest by the sage, when Raghu sonHis onward journey had begun,Thus in her soft tone Sítá, meekWith modest fear, began to speak:\"One little slip the great may leadTo shame that follows lawless deed:Such shame, my lord, as still must clingTo faults from low desire that spring.Three several sins defile the soul,Born of desire that spurns control:First, utterance of a lying word,Then, viler both, the next, and third:The lawless love of other wife,The thirst of blood uncaused by strife.The first, O Raghu son, in theeNone yet has found, none e\\'er shall see.Love of another dame destroysAll merit, lost for guilty joys:Ráma, such crime in thee, I ween,Has ne\\'er been found, shall ne\\'er be seen:The very thought, my princely lord,Is in thy secret soul abhorred.For thou hast ever been the sameFond lover of thine own dear dame,Content with faithful heart to doThy father will, most just and true:Justice, and faith, and many a graceIn thee have found a resting-place.Such virtues, Prince, the good may gainWho empire o\\'er each sense retain;And well canst thou, with loving viewRegarding all, each sense subdue.But for the third, the lust that strives,Insatiate still, for others\\' lives,--Fond thirst of blood where hate is none,--This, O my lord, thou wilt not shun.Thou hast but now a promise made,The saints of Dandak wood to aid:And to protect their lives from illThe giants\\' blood in tight wilt spill:And from thy promise lasting fameWill glorify the forest name.Armed with thy bow and arrows thouForth with thy brother journeyest now,While as I think how true thou artFears for thy bliss assail my heart,And all my spirit at the sightIs troubled with a strange affright.I like it not--it seems not good--Thy going thus to Dandak wood:And I, if thou wilt mark me well,The reason of my fear will tell.Thou with thy brother, bow in hand,Beneath those ancient trees wilt stand,And thy keen arrows will not spareWood-rovers who will meet thee there.For as the fuel food suppliesThat bids the dormant flame arise,Thus when the warrior grasps his bowHe feels his breast with ardour glow.Deep in a holy grove, of yore,Where bird and beast from strife forbore,Suchi beneath the sheltering boughs,A truthful hermit kept his vows.Then Indra, Sachí heavenly lord,Armed like a warrior with a sword,Came to his tranquil home to spoilThe hermit of his holy toil,And left the glorious weapon thereEntrusted to the hermit care,A pledge for him to keep, whose mindTo fervent zeal was all resigned.He took the brand: with utmost heedHe kept it for the warrior need:To keep his trust he fondly stroveWhen roaming in the neighbouring grove:Whene\\'er for roots and fruit he strayedStill by his side he bore the blade:Still on his sacred charge intent,He took his treasure when he went.As day by day that brand he wore,The hermit, rich in merit storeFrom penance rites each thought withdrew,And fierce and wild his spirit grew.With heedless soul he spurned the right,And found in cruel deeds delight.So, living with the sword, he fell,A ruined hermit, down to hell.This tale applies to those who dealToo closely with the warrior steel:The steel to warriors is the sameAs fuel to the smouldering flame.Sincere affection prompts my speech:I honour where I fain would teach.Mayst thou, thus armed with shaft and bow,So dire a longing never knowAs, when no hatred prompts the fray,These giants of the wood to slay:For he who kills without offenceShall win but little glory thence.The bow the warrior joys to bendIs lent him for a nobler end,That he may save and succour thoseWho watch in woods when pressed by foes.What, matched with woods, is bow or steel?What, warrior arm with hermit zeal?We with such might have naught to do:The forest rule should guide us too.But when Ayodhyá hails thee lord,Be then thy warrior life restored:So shall thy sire(423) and mother joyIn bliss that naught may e\\'er destroy.And if, resigning empire, thouSubmit thee to the hermit vow,The noblest gain from virtue springs,And virtue joy unending brings.All earthly blessings virtue sends:On virtue all the world depends.Those who with vow and fasting tameTo due restraint the mind and frame,Win by their labour, nobly wise,The highest virtue for their prize.Pure in the hermit grove remain,True to thy duty, free from stain.But the three worlds are open thrownTo thee, by whom all things are known.Who gave me power that I should dareHis duty to my lord declare?\\'Tis woman fancy, light as air,That moves my foolish breast.Now with thy brother counsel take,Reflect, thy choice with judgment make,And do what seems the best.\"Canto X. Ráma Reply.The words that Sítá uttered, spurredBy truest love, the hero heard:Then he who ne\\'er from virtue strayedTo Janak child his answer made:\"In thy wise speech, sweet love, I findTrue impress of thy gentle mind,Well skilled the warrior path to trace,Thou pride of Janak ancient race.What fitting answer shall I frameTo thy good words, my honoured dame?Thou sayst the warrior bears the bowThat misery tears may cease to flow;And those pure saints who love the shadeOf Dandak wood are sore dismayed.They sought me of their own accord,With suppliant prayers my aid implored:They, fed on roots and fruit, who spendTheir lives where bosky wilds extend,My timid love, enjoy no restBy these malignant fiends distressed.These make the flesh of man their meat:The helpless saints they kill and eat.The hermits sought my side, the chiefOf Bráhman race declared their grief.I heard, and from my lips there fellThe words which thou rememberest well:I listened as the hermits cried,And to their prayers I thus replied:\"Your favour, gracious lords, I claim,O\\'erwhelmed with this enormous shameThat Bráhmans, great and pure as you,Who should be sought, to me should sue.\"And then before the saintly crowd,\"What can I do?\" I cried aloud.Then from the trembling hermits brokeOne long sad cry, and thus they spoke:\"Fiends of the wood, who wear at willEach varied shape, afflict us still.To thee in our distress we fly:O help us, Ráma, or we die.When sacred rites of fire are due,When changing moons are full or new,These fiends who bleeding flesh devourAssail us with resistless power.They with their cruel might tormentThe hermits on their vows intent:We look around for help and seeOur surest refuge, Prince, in thee.We, armed with powers of penance, mightDestroy the rovers of the night:But loth were we to bring to naughtThe merit years of toil have bought.Our penance rites are grown too hard,By many a check and trouble barred,But though our saints for food are slainThe withering curse we yet restrain.Thus many a weary day distressedBy giants who this wood infest,We see at length deliverance, thouWith Lakshman art our guardian now.\"As thus the troubled hermits prayed,I promised, dame, my ready aid,And now--for truth I hold most dear--Still to my word must I adhere.My love, I might endure to beDeprived of Lakshman, life, and thee,But ne\\'er deny my promise, ne\\'erTo Bráhmans break the oath I sware.I must, enforced by high constraint,Protect them all. Each suffering saintIn me, unasked, his help had found;Still more in one by promise bound.I know thy words, mine own dear dame,From thy sweet heart affection came:I thank thee for thy gentle speech,For those we love are those we teach.\\'Tis like thyself, O fair of face,\\'Tis worthy of thy noble race:Dearer than life, thy feet are setIn righteous paths they ne\\'er forget.\"Thus to the Maithil monarch child,His own dear wife, in accents mildThe high-souled hero said:Then to the holy groves which layBeyond them fair to see, their wayThe bow-armed chieftain led.Canto XI. Agastya.Ráma went foremost of the three,Next Sítá, followed, fair to see,And Lakshman with his bow in handWalked hindmost of the little band.As onward through the wood they went,With great delight their eyes were bentOn rocky heights beside the wayAnd lofty trees with blossoms gay;And streamlets running fair and fastThe royal youths with Sítá passed.They watched the sáras and the drakeOn islets of the stream and lake,And gazed delighted on the floodsBright with gay birds and lotus buds.They saw in startled herds the roes,The passion-frenzied buffaloes,Wild elephants who fiercely toreThe tender trees, and many a boar.A length of woodland way they passed,And when the sun was low at lastA lovely stream-fed lake they spied,Two leagues across from side to side.Tall elephants fresh beauty gaveTo grassy bank and lilied wave,By many a swan and sáras stirred,Mallard, and gay-winged water-bird.From those sweet waters, loud and long,Though none was seen to wake the song,Swelled high the singer music blentWith each melodious instrument.Ráma and car-borne Lakshman heardThe charming strain, with wonder stirred,Turned on the margent of the lakeTo Dharmabhrit(424) the sage, and spake:\"Our longing souls, O hermit, burnThis music of the lake to learn:We pray thee, noblest sage, explainThe cause of the mysterious strain.\"He, as the son of Raghu prayed,With swift accord his answer made,And thus the hermit, virtuous-souled,The story of the fair lake told:\"Through every age \\'tis known to fame,Panchápsaras(425) its glorious name,By holy Mándakarni wroughtWith power his rites austere had bought.For he, great votarist, intentOn strictest rule his stern life spent.Ten thousand years the stream his bed,Ten thousand years on air he fed.Then on the blessed Gods who dwellIn heavenly homes great terror fell:They gathered all, by Agni led,And counselled thus disquieted:\"The hermit by ascetic painThe seat of one of us would gain.\"Thus with their hearts by fear oppressedIn full assembly spoke the Blest,And bade five loveliest nymphs, as fairAs lightning in the evening air,Armed with their winning wiles, seduceFrom his stern vows the great recluse.Though lore of earth and heaven he knew,The hermit from his task they drew,And made the great ascetic slaveTo conquering love, the Gods to save.Each of the heavenly five became,Bound to the sage, his wedded dame;And he, for his beloved sake,Formed a fair palace neath the lake.Under the flood the ladies live,To joy and ease their days they give,And lap in bliss the hermit wooedFrom penance rites to youth renewed.So when the sportive nymphs withinThose secret bowers their play begin,You hear the singers\\' dulcet tonesBlend sweetly with their tinkling zones.\"\"How wondrous are these words of thine!\"Cried the famed chiefs of Raghu line,As thus they heard the sage unfoldThe marvels of the tale he told.As Ráma spake, his eyes were bentUpon a hermit settlementWith light of heavenly lore endued,With sacred grass and vesture strewed.His wife and brother by his side,Within the holy bounds he hied,And there, with honour entertainedBy all the saints, a while remained.In time, by due succession led,Each votary cot he visited,And then the lord of martial lore,Returned where he had lodged before.Here for the months, content, he stayed,There for a year his visit paid:Here for four months his home would fix,There, as it chanced, for five or six.Here for eight months and there for threeThe son of Raghu stay would be:Here weeks, there fortnights, more or less,He spent in tranquil happiness.As there the hero dwelt at easeAmong those holy devotees,In days untroubled o\\'er his headTen circling years of pleasure fled.So Raghu son in duty trainedA while in every cot remained,Then with his dame retraced the roadTo good Sutíkshna calm abode.Hailed by the saints with honours dueNear to the hermit home he drew,And there the tamer of his foesDwelt for a time in sweet repose.One day within that holy woodBy saint Sutíkshna Ráma stood,And thus the prince with reverence meekTo that high sage began to speak:\"In the wide woodlands that extendAround us, lord most reverend,As frequent voice of rumour tells,Agastya, saintliest hermit, dwells.So vast the wood, I cannot traceThe path to reach his dwelling place,Nor, searching unassisted, findThat hermit of the thoughtful mind.I with my wife and brother fainWould go, his favour to obtain,Would seek him in his lone retreatAnd the great saint with reverence greet.This one desire, O Master, longCherished within my heart, is strong,That I may pay of free accordMy duty to that hermit lord.\"As thus the prince whose heart was bentOn virtue told his firm intent,The good Sutíkshna joy rose high,And thus in turn he made reply:\"The very thing, O Prince, which thouHast sought, I wished to urge but now,Bid thee with wife and brother seeAgastya, glorious devotee.I count this thing an omen fairThat thou shouldst thus thy wish declare,And I, my Prince, will gladly teachThe way Agastya home to reach.Southward, dear son, direct thy feetEight leagues beyond this still retreat:Agastya hermit brother thereDwells in a home most bright and fair.\\'Tis on a knoll of woody ground,With many a branching Pippal(426) crowned:There sweet birds\\' voices ne\\'er are mute,And trees are gay with flower and fruit.There many a lake gleams bright and cool,And lilies deck each pleasant pool,While swan, and crane, and mallard wingsAre lovely in the water-springs.There for one night, O Ráma, stay,And with the dawn pursue thy way.Still farther, bending southward, byThe thicket edge the course must lie,And thou wilt see, two leagues from thenceAgastya lovely residence,Set in the woodland fairest spot,All varied foliage decks the cot:There Sítá, Lakshman thou, at easeMay spend sweet hours neath shady trees,For all of noblest growth are foundLuxuriant on that bosky ground.If it be still thy firm intentTo see that saint preëminent,O mighty counsellor, this dayDepart upon thine onward way.\"The hermit spake, and Ráma bentHis head, with Lakshman, reverent,And then with him and Janak childSet out to trace the forest wild.He saw dark woods that fringed the road,And distant hills like clouds that showed,And, as the way he followed, metWith many a lake and rivulet.So passing on with ease where ledThe path Sutíkshna bade him tread,The hero with exulting breastHis brother in these words addressed:\"Here, surely, is the home, in sight,Of that illustrious anchorite:Here great Agastya brother leadsA life intent on holy deeds.Warned of each guiding mark and sign,I see them all herein combine:I see the branches bending lowBeneath the flowers and fruit they show.A soft air from the forest springs,Fresh from the odorous grass, and bringsA spicy fragrance as it fleesO\\'er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.See, here and there around us highPiled up in heaps cleft billets lie,And holy grass is gathered, brightAs strips of shining lazulite.Full in the centre of the shadeThe hermits\\' holy fire is laid:I see its smoke the pure heaven streakDense as a big cloud dusky peak.The twice-born men their steps retraceFrom each sequestered bathing-place,And each his sacred gift has broughtOf blossoms which his hands have sought.Of all these signs, dear brother, eachAgrees with good Sutíkshna speech,And doubtless in this holy boundAgastya brother will be found.Agastya once, the worlds who viewedWith love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,And armed with mighty power, obtainedBy holy works, this grove ordainedTo be a refuge and defenceFrom all oppressors\\' violence.In days of yore within this placeTwo brothers fierce of demon race,Vátápi dire and Ilval, dwelt,And slaughter mid the Bráhmans dealt.A Bráhman form, the fiend to cloak,Fierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,And twice-born sages would inviteTo solemnize some funeral rite.His brother flesh, concealed withinA ram false shape and borrowed skin,--As men are wont at funeral feasts,--He dressed and fed those gathered priests.The holy men, unweeting ill,Took of the food and ate their fill.Then Ilval with a mighty shoutExclaimed \"Vátápi, issue out.\"Soon as his brother voice he heard,The fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:Rending in pieces every frame,Forth from the dying priests he came.So they who changed their forms at willThousands of Bráhmans dared to kill,--Fierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,And joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.Agastya, mighty hermit, pressedTo funeral banquet like the rest,Obedient to the Gods\\' appealAte up the monster at a meal.\"\\'Tis done, \\'tis done,\" fierce Ilval cried,And water for his hands supplied:Then lifting up his voice he spake:\"Forth, brother, from thy prison break.\"Then him who called the fiend, who longHad wrought the suffering Bráhmans wrong,Thus thoughtful-souled Agastya, bestOf hermits, with a smile addressed:\"How, Rákshas, is the fiend empoweredTo issue forth whom I devoured?Thy brother in a ram disguiseIs gone where Yáma kingdom lies.\"When from the words Agastya saidHe knew his brother fiend was dead,His soul on fire with vengeful rage,Rushed the night-rover at the sage.One lightning glance of fury, hotAs fire, the glorious hermit shot,As the fiend neared him in his stride,And straight, consumed to dust, he died.In pity for the Bráhmans\\' plightAgastya wrought this deed of might:This grove which lakes and fair trees graceIn his great brother dwelling place.\"As Ráma thus the tale rehearsed,And with Sumitrá son conversed,The setting sun his last rays shed,And evening o\\'er the land was spread.A while the princely brothers stayedAnd even rites in order paid,Then to the holy grove they drewAnd hailed the saint with honour due.With courtesy was Ráma metBy that illustrious anchoret,And for one night he rested thereRegaled with fruit and hermit fare.But when the night had reached its close,And the sun glorious circle rose,The son of Raghu left his bedAnd to the hermit brother said:\"Well rested in thy hermit cell,I stand, O saint, to bid farewell;For with thy leave I journey henceThy brother saint to reverence.\"\"Go, Ráma go,\" the sage replied:Then from the cot the chieftain hied.And while the pleasant grove he viewed,The path the hermit showed, pursued.Of every leaf, of changing hue.Plants, trees by hundreds round him grew,With joyous eyes he looked on all,Then Jak,(427) the wild rice, and Sál;(428)He saw the red Hibiscus glow,He saw the flower-tipped creeper throwThe glory of her clusters o\\'erTall trees that loads of blossom bore.Some, elephants had prostrate laid,In some the monkeys leapt and played,And through the whole wide forest rangThe charm of gay birds as they sang.Then Ráma of the lotus eyeTo Lakshman turned who followed nigh,And thus the hero youth impressedWith Fortune favouring signs, addressed:\"How soft the leaves of every tree,How tame each bird and beast we see!Soon the fair home shall we beholdOf that great hermit tranquil-souled.The deed the good Agastya wroughtHigh fame throughout the world has bought:I see, I see his calm retreatThat balms the pain of weary feet.Where white clouds rise from flames beneath,Where bark-coats lie with many a wreath,Where silvan things, made gentle, throng,And every bird is loud in song.With ruth for suffering creatures filled,A deathlike fiend with might he killed,And gave this southern realm to beA refuge, from oppression free.There stands his home, whose dreaded mightHas put the giant crew to flight,Who view with envious eyes afarThe peaceful shades they cannot mar.Since that most holy saint has madeHis dwelling in this lovely shade,Checked by his might the giant broodHave dwelt in peace with souls subdued.And all this southern realm, withinWhose bounds no fiend may entrance win,Now bears a name which naught may dim,Made glorious through the worlds by him.When Vindhya, best of hills, would stayThe journey of the Lord of Day,Obedient to the saint behestHe bowed for aye his humbled crest.That hoary hermit, world-renownedFor holy deeds, within this groundHas set his pure and blessed home,Where gentle silvan creatures roam.Agastya, whom the worlds revere,Pure saint to whom the good are dear,To us his guests all grace will show,Enriched with blessings ere we go.I to this aim each thought will turn,The favour of the saint to earn,That here in comfort may be spentThe last years of our banishment.Here sanctities and high saints stand,Gods, minstrels of the heavenly band;Upon Agastya will they wait,And serve him, pure and temperate.The liar tongue, the tyrant mindWithin these bounds no home may find:No cheat, no sinner here can be:So holy and so good is he.Here birds and lords of serpent race,Spirits and Gods who haunt the place,Content with scanty fare remain,As merit meed they strive to gain.Made perfect here, the saints supreme,On cars that mock the Day-God gleam,--Their mortal bodies cast aside,--Sought heaven transformed and glorified,Here Gods to living things, who winTheir favour, pure from cruel sin,Give royal rule and many a good,Immortal life and spirithood.Now, Lakshman, we are near the place:Do thou precede a little space,And tell the mighty saint that IWith Sítá at my side am nigh.\"Canto XII. The Heavenly Bow.He spoke: the younger prince obeyed:Within the bounds his way he made,And thus addressed, whom first he met,A pupil of the anchoret:\"Brave Ráma, eldest born, who springs,From Dasaratha, hither bringsHis wife the lady Sítá: heWould fain the holy hermit see.Lakshman am I--if happy fameE\\'er to thine ears has brought the name--His younger brother, prompt to doHis will, devoted, fond, and true.We, through our royal sire decree,To the dread woods were forced to flee.Tell the great Master, I entreat,Our earnest wish our lord to greet.\"He spoke: the hermit rich in storeOf fervid zeal and sacred lore,Sought the pure shrine which held the fire,To bear his message to the sire.Soon as he reached the saint most brightIn sanctity surpassing might,He cried, uplifting reverent hands:\"Lord Ráma near thy cottage stands.\"Then spoke Agastya pupil dearThe message for his lord to hear:\"Ráma and Lakshman, chiefs who springFrom Dasaratha, glorious king,Thy hermitage e\\'en now have sought,And lady Sítá with them brought.The tamers of the foe are hereTo see thee, Master, and revere.\\'Tis thine thy further will to say:Deign to command, and we obey.\"When from his pupil lips he knewThe presence of the princely two,And Sítá born to fortune high.The glorious hermit made reply:\"Great joy at last is mine this dayThat Ráma hither finds his way,For long my soul has yearned to seeThe prince who comes to visit me.Go forth, go forth, and hither bringThe royal three with welcoming:Lead Ráma in and place him near:Why stands he not already here?\"Thus ordered by the hermit, who,Lord of his thought, all duty knew,His reverent hands together laid,The pupil answered and obeyed.Forth from the place with speed he ran,To Lakshman came and thus began:\"Where is he? let not Ráma wait,But speed, the sage to venerate.\"Then with the pupil Lakshman wentAcross the hermit settlement,And showed him Ráma where he stoodWith Janak daughter in the wood.The pupil then his message spakeWhich the kind hermit bade him take;Then led the honoured Ráma thenceAnd brought him in with reverence.As nigh the royal Ráma cameWith Lakshman and the Maithil dame,He viewed the herds of gentle deerRoaming the garden free from fear.As through the sacred grove he trodHe viewed the seat of many a God,Brahmá and Agni,(429) Sun and Moon,And His who sends each golden boon;(430)Here Vishnu stood, there Bhaga(431) shrine,And there Mahendra, Lord divine;Here His who formed this earthly frame,(432)His there from whom all beings came.(433)Váyu,(434) and His who loves to holdThe great noose, Varun(435) mighty-souled:Here was the Vasus\\'(436) shrine to see,Here that of sacred Gáyatrí,(437)The king of serpents(438) here had place,And he who rules the feathered race.(439)Here Kártikeya,(440) warrior lord,And there was Justice King adored.Then with disciples girt aboutThe mighty saint himself came out:Through fierce devotion bright as flameBefore the rest the Master came:And then to Lakshman, fortune blest,Ráma these hasty words addressed:\"Behold, Agastya self draws near,The mighty saint, whom all revere:With spirit raised I meet my lordWith richest wealth of penance stored.\"The strong-armed hero spake, and ranForward to meet the sunbright man.Before him, as he came, he bentAnd clasped his feet most reverent,Then rearing up his stately heightStood suppliant by the anchorite,While Lakshman strength and Sítá graceStood by the pride of Raghu race.The sage his arms round Ráma threwAnd welcomed him with honours due,Asked, was all well, with question sweet,And bade the hero to a seat.With holy oil he fed the flame,He brought the gifts which strangers claim,And kindly waiting on the threeWith honours due to high degree,He gave with hospitable careA simple hermit woodland fare.Then sat the reverend father, firstOf hermits, deep in duty versed.And thus to suppliant Ráma, bredIn all the lore of virtue, said:\"Did the false hermit, Prince, neglectTo hail his guest with due respect,He must,--the doom the perjured meet,--His proper flesh hereafter eat.A car-borne king, a lord who swaysThe earth, and virtue law obeys,Worthy of highest honour, thouHast sought, dear guest, my cottage now.\"He spoke: with fruit and hermit fare,With every bloom the branches bare,Agastya graced his honoured guest,And thus with gentle words addressed:\"Accept this mighty bow, divine,Whereon red gold and diamonds shine;\\'Twas by the Heavenly Artist plannedFor Vishnu own almighty hand;This God-sent shaft of sunbright hue,Whose deadly flight is ever true,By Lord Mahendra given of yore:This quiver with its endless store.Keen arrows hurtling to their aimLike kindled fires that flash and flame:Accept, in golden sheath encased,This sword with hilt of rich gold graced.Armed with this best of bowsLord Vishnu slew his demon foes,And mid the dwellers in the skiesWon brilliant glory for his prize.The bow, the quivers, shaft, and swordReceived from me, O glorious lord:These conquest to thine arm shall bring,As thunder to the thunder King.\"The splendid hermit bade him takeThe noble weapons as he spake,And as the prince accepted eachIn words like these renewed his speech:Canto XIII. Agastya Counsel.\"O Ráma, great delight I feel,Pleased, Lakshman, with thy faithful zeal,That you within these shades I seeWith Sítá come to honour me.But wandering through the rough rude wildHas wearied Janak gentle child:With labours of the way oppressedThe Maithil lady longs for rest.Young, delicate, and soft, and fair,Such toils as these untrained to bear,Her wifely love the dame has ledThe forest troubled ways to tread.Here, Ráma, see that naught annoyHer easy hours of tranquil joy:A glorious task has she assayed,To follow thee through woodland shade.Since first from Nature hand she came,A woman mood is still the same,When Fortune smiles, her love to show,And leave her lord in want and woe.No pity then her heart can feel,She arms her soul with warrior steel,Swift as the storm or Feathered King,Uncertain as the lightning wing.Not so thy spouse: her purer mindShrinks from the faults of womankind;Like chaste Arundhatí(441) above,A paragon of faithful love.Let these blest shades, dear Ráma, beA home for Lakshman, her, and thee.\"With raised hands reverently meekHe heard the holy hermit speak,And humbly thus addressed the sireWhose glory shone like kindled fire:\"How blest am I, what thanks I oweThat our great Master deigns to showHis favour, that his heart can beContent with Lakshman, Sítá, me.Show me, I pray, some spot of groundWhere thick trees wave and springs abound,That I may raise my hermit cellAnd there in tranquil pleasure dwell.\"Then thus replied Agastya, bestOf hermits, to the chief request:When for a little he had bentHis thoughts, upon that prayer intent:\"Beloved son, four leagues awayIs Panchavatí bright and gay:Thronged with its deer, most fair it looksWith berries, fruit, and water-brooks.There build thee with thy brother aidA cottage in the quiet shade,And faithful to thy sire behest,Obedient to the sentence, rest.For well, O sinless chieftain, wellI know thy tale, how all befell:Stern penance and the love I boreThy royal sire supply the lore.To me long rites and fervid zealThe wish that stirs thy heart reveal,And hence my guest I bade thee be,That this pure grove might shelter thee.So now, thereafter, thus I speak:The shades of Panchavatí seek;That tranquil spot is bright and fair,And Sítá will be happy there.Not far remote from here it lies,A grove to charm thy loving eyes,Godávarí pure stream is nigh:There Sítá days will sweetly fly.Pure, lovely, rich in many a charm,O hero of the mighty arm,\\'Tis gay with every plant and fruit,And throngs of gay buds never mute.Thou, true to virtue path, hast mightTo screen each trusting anchorite,And wilt from thy new home defendThe hermits who on thee depend.Now yonder, Prince, direct thine eyesWhere dense Madhúka(442) woods arise:Pierce their dark shade, and issuing forthTurn to a fig-tree on the north:Then onward up a sloping meadFlanked by a hill the way will lead:There Panchavatí, ever gayWith ceaseless bloom, thy steps will stay.\"The hermit ceased: the princely twoWith seemly honours bade adieu:With reverential awe each youthBowed to the saint whose word was truth,And then, dismissed with Sítá, theyTo Panchavatí took their way.Thus when each royal prince had graspedHis warrior mighty bow, and claspedHis quiver to his side,With watchful eyes along the roadThe glorious saint Agastya showed,Dauntless in fight the brothers strode,And Sítá with them hied.Canto XIV. Jatáyus.Then as the son of Raghu madeHis way to Panchavatí shade,A mighty vulture he beheldOf size and strength unparalleled.The princes, when the bird they saw,Approached with reverence and awe,And as his giant form they eyed,\"Tell who thou art,\" in wonder cried.The bird, as though their hearts to gain,Addressed them thus in gentlest strain;\"In me, dear sons, the friend beholdYour royal father loved of old.\"He spoke: nor long did Ráma waitHis sire dear friend to venerate:He bade the bird declare his nameAnd the high race of which he came.When Raghu son had spoken, heDeclared his name and pedigree,His words prolonging to discloseHow all the things that be arose:\"List while I tell, O Raghu son,The first-born Fathers, one by one,Great Lords of Life, whence all in earthAnd all in heaven derive their birth.First Kardam heads the glorious raceWhere Vikrit holds the second place,With Sesha, Sansray next in line,And Bahuputra might divine.Then Sthánu and Maríchi came,Atri, and Kratu forceful frame.Pulastya followed, next to himAngiras\\' name shall ne\\'er be dim.Prachetas, Pulah next, and thenDaksha, Vivasvat praised of men:Aríshtanemi next, and lastKasyap in glory unsurpassed.From Daksha,--fame the tale has told--:Three-score bright daughters sprang of old.Of these fair-waisted nymphs the greatLord Kasyap sought and wedded eight,Aditi, Diti, Kálaká,Támrá, Danú, and Analá,And Krodhavasá swift to ire,And Manu(443) glorious as her sire.Then when the mighty Kasyap criedDelighted to each tender bride:\"Sons shalt thou bear, to rule the threeGreat worlds, in might resembling me.\"Aditi, Diti, and DanúObeyed his will as consorts true,And Kálaká; but all the restRefused to hear their lord behest.First Aditi conceived, and she,Mother of thirty Gods and three,The Vasus and Ádityas bare,Rudras, and Asvins, heavenly pair.Of Diti sprang the Daityas: fameDelights to laud their ancient name.In days of yore their empire dreadO\\'er earth and woods and ocean spread.Danú was mother of a child,O hero, Asvagríva styled,And Narak next and Kálak cameOf Kálaká, celestial dame.Of Támrá, too, five daughters brightIn deathless glory sprang to light.Ennobling fame still keeps aliveThe titles of the lovely five:Immortal honour still she claimsFor Kraunchí, Bhasí, Syení names.And wills not that the world forgetSukí or Dhritaráshtrí yet.Then Kraunchí bare the crane and owl,And Bhásí tribes of water fowl:Vultures and hawks that race through airWith storm-fleet pinions Syení bare.All swans and geese on mere and brookTheir birth from Dhritaráshtrí took,And all the river-haunting broodOf ducks, a countless multitude.From Sukí Nalá sprang, who bareDame Vinatá surpassing fair.From fiery Krodhavasá, tenBright daughters sprang, O King of men:Mrigí and Mrigamandá named,Hari and Bhadramadá famed,Sárdúlí, Svetá fair to see,Mátangí bright, and Surabhí,Surasá marked with each fair sign,And Kadrumá, all maids divine.Mrigí, O Prince without a peer,Was mother of the herds of deer,The bear, the yak, the mountain roeTheir birth to Mrigamandá owe;And Bhadramadá joyed to beMother of fair Irávatí,Who bare Airávat,(444) huge of mould,Mid warders of the earth enrolled,From Harí lordly lions trace,With monkeys of the wild, their race.From the great dame Sárdúlí styledSprung pards, Lángúrs,(445) and tigers wild.Mátangí, Prince, gave birth to allMátangas, elephants strong and tall,And Svetá bore the beasts who standOne at each wind, earth warder band.(446)Next Surabhí the Goddess boreTwo heavenly maids, O Prince, of yore,Gandharví--dear to fame is she--And her sweet sister Rohiní.With kine this daughter filled each mead,And bright Gandharví bore the steed.(447)Surasá bore the serpents:(448) allThe snakes Kadrú their mother call.Then Manu, high-souled Kasyap(449) wife,To all the race of men gave life,The Bráhmans first, the Kshatriya caste,Then Vaisyas, and the Súdras last.Sprang from her mouth the Bráhman race;Her chest the Kshatriyas\\' natal place:The Vaisyas from her thighs, \\'tis said,The Súdras from her feet were bred.From Analá all trees that hangTheir fair fruit-laden branches sprang.The child of beauteous Sukí boreVinatá, as I taught before:And Surasá and Kadrú wereBorn of one dame, a noble pair.Kadrú gave birth to countless snakesThat roam the earth in woods and brakes.Arun and Garud swift of flightBy Vinatá were given to light,And sons of Arun red as mornSampati first, then I was born,Me then, O tamer of the foe,Jatáyus, son of Syení, know.Thy ready helper will I be,And guard thy house, if thou agree:When thou and Lakshman urge the chaseBy Sítá side shall be my place.\"With courteous thanks for promised aid,The prince, to rapture stirred,Bent low, and due obeisance paid,Embraced the royal bird.He often in the days gone byHad heard his father tellHow, linked with him in friendship tie,He loved Jatáyus well.He hastened to his trusted friendHis darling to confide,And through the wood his steps to bendBy strong Jatáyus\\' side.On to the grove, with Lakshman near,The prince his way pursuedTo free those pleasant shades from fearAnd slay the giant brood.Canto XV. Panchavatí.Arrived at Panchavatí shadeWhere silvan life and serpents strayed,Ráma in words like these addressedLakshman of vigour unrepressed:\"Brother, our home is here: beholdThe grove of which the hermit told:The bowers of Panchavatí seeMade fair by every blooming tree.Now, brother, bend thine eyes around;With skilful glance survey the ground:Here be some spot selected, bestApproved for gentle hermits\\' rest,Where thou, the Maithil dame, and IMay dwell while seasons sweetly fly.Some pleasant spot be chosen wherePure waters gleam and trees are fair,Some nook where flowers and wood are foundAnd sacred grass and springs abound.\"Then Lakshman, Sítá standing by,Raised reverent hands, and made reply:\"A hundred years shall flee, and stillWill I obey my brother will:Select thyself a pleasant spot;Be mine the care to rear the cot.\"The glorious chieftain, pleased to hearThat loving speech that soothed his ear,Selected with observant careA spot with every charm most fair.He stood within that calm retreat,A shade for hermits\\' home most meet,And thus Sumitrá son addressed,While his dear hand in his he pressed:\"See, see this smooth and lovely gladeWhich flowery trees encircling shade:Do thou, beloved Lakshman rearA pleasant cot to lodge us here.I see beyond that feathery brakeThe gleaming of a lilied lake,Where flowers in sunlike glory throwFresh odours from the wave below.Agastya words now find we true,He told the charms which here we view:Here are the trees that blossom o\\'erGodávarí most lovely shore.Whose pleasant flood from side to sideWith swans and geese is beautified,And fair banks crowded with the deerThat steal from every covert near.The peacock cry is loud and shrillFrom many a tall and lovely hill,Green-belted by the trees that waveFull blossoms o\\'er the rock and cave.Like elephants whose huge fronts glowWith painted streaks, the mountains showLong lines of gold and silver sheenWith copper darker hues between.With every tree each hill is graced,Where creepers blossom interlaced.Look where the Sál long branches sway,And palms their fanlike leaves display;The date-tree and the Jak are near,And their long stems Tamálas rear.See the tall Mango lift his head,Asokas all their glory spread,The Ketak her sweet buds unfold,And Champacs hang their cups of gold.(450)The spot is pure and pleasant: hereAre multitudes of birds and deer.O Lakshman, with our father friendWhat happy hours we here shall spend!\"He spoke: the conquering Lakshman heard,Obedient to his brother word.Raised by his toil a cottage stoodTo shelter Ráma in the wood,Of ample size, with leaves o\\'erlaid,Of hardened earth the walls were made.The strong bamboos his hands had felledFor pillars fair the roof upheld,And rafter, beam, and lath suppliedWell interwrought from side to side.Then Samí(451) boughs he deftly spreadEnlaced with knotted cord o\\'erhead,Well thatched above from ridge to eavesWith holy grass, and reed, and leaves.The mighty chief with careful toilHad cleared the ground and smoothed the soilWhere now, his loving labour done,Rose a fair home for Raghu son.Then when his work was duly wrought,Godávarís sweet stream he sought,Bathed, plucked the lilies, and a storeOf fruit and berries homeward bore.Then sacrifice he duly paid,And wooed the Gods their hopes to aid,And then to Ráma proudly showedThe cot prepared for his abode.Then Raghu son with Sítá gazedUpon the home his hands had raised,And transport thrilled his bosom throughHis leafy hermitage to view.The glorious son of Raghu roundHis brother neck his arms enwound,And thus began his sweet addressOf deep-felt joy and gentleness:\"Well pleased am I, dear lord, to seeThis noble work performed by thee.For this,--sole grace I can bestow,--About thy neck mine arms I throw.So wise art thou, thy breast is filledWith grateful thoughts, in duty skilled,Our mighty father, free from stain,In thee, his offspring, lives again.\"Thus spoke the prince, who lent a graceTo fortune, pride of Raghu race;Then in that spot whose pleasant shadeGave store of fruit, content he stayed.With Lakshman and his Maithil spouseHe spent his day neath sheltering boughs,As happy as a God on highLives in his mansion in the sky.Canto XVI. Winter.While there the high-souled hero spentHis tranquil hours in sweet content,The glowing autumn passed, and thenCame winter so beloved of men.One morn, to bathe, at break of dayTo the fair stream he took his way.Behind him, with the Maithil dameBearing a pitcher Lakshman came,And as he went the mighty manThus to his brother chief began:\"The time is come, to thee more dearThan all the months that mark the year:The gracious seasons\\' joy and pride,By which the rest are glorified.A robe of hoary rime is spreadO\\'er earth, with corn engarlanded.The streams we loved no longer please,But near the fire we take our ease.Now pious men to God and shadeOffer young corn fresh sprouted blade,And purge away their sins with riceBestowed in humble sacrifice.Rich stores of milk delight the swain,And hearts are cheered that longed for gain,Proud kings whose breasts for conquests glowLead bannered troops to smite the foe.Dark is the north: the Lord of DayTo Yáma south(452) has turned away:And she--sad widow--shines no more,Reft of the bridal mark(453) she wore.Himálaya hill, ordained of oldThe treasure-house of frost and cold,Scarce conscious of the feebler glow,Is truly now the Lord of Snow.Warmed by the noontide genial raysDelightful are the glorious days:But how we shudder at the chillOf evening shadows and the rill!How weak the sun, how cold the breeze!How white the rime on grass and trees!The leaves are sere, the woods have lostTheir blossoms killed by nipping frost.Neath open skies we sleep no more:December nights with rime are hoar:Their triple watch(454) in length extendsWith hours the shortened daylight lends.No more the moon sun-borrowed raysAre bright, involved in misty haze,As when upon the mirror sheenThe breath obscuring cloud is seen.E\\'en at the full the faint beams failTo struggle through the darksome veil:Changed like her hue, they want the graceThat parts not yet from Sítá face.Cold is the western wind, but howIts piercing chill is heightened now,Blowing at early morning twiceAs furious with its breath of ice!See how the dewy tears they weepThe barley, wheat, and woodland steep,Where, as the sun goes up the sky,The curlew and the sáras cry.See where the rice plants scarce upholdTheir full ears tinged with paly gold,Bending their ripe heads slowly downFair as the date tree flowery crown.Though now the sun has mounted highSeeking the forehead of the sky,Such mist obscures his struggling beams,No bigger than the moon he seems.Though weak at first, his rays at lengthGrow pleasant in their noonday strength,And where a while they chance to fallFling a faint splendour over all.See, o\\'er the woods where grass is wetWith hoary drops that cling there yet,With soft light clothing earth and boughThere steals a tender glory now.Yon elephant who longs to drink,Still standing on the river brink,Plucks back his trunk in shivering hasteFrom the cold wave he fain would taste.The very fowl that haunt the mereStand doubtful on the bank, and fearTo dip them in the wintry waveAs cowards dread to meet the brave.The frost of night, the rime of dawnBind flowerless trees and glades of lawn:Benumbed in apathetic chillOf icy chains they slumber still.You hear the hidden sáras cryFrom floods that wrapped in vapour lie,And frosty-shining sands revealWhere the unnoticed rivers steal.The hoary rime of dewy night,And suns that glow with tempered lightLend fresh cool flavours to the rillThat sparkles from the topmost hill.The cold has killed the lily pride:Leaf, filament, and flower have died:With chilling breath rude winds have blown,The withered stalk is left alone.At this gay time, O noblest chief,The faithful Bharat, worn by grief,Lives in the royal town where heSpends weary hours for love of thee.From titles, honour, kingly sway,From every joy he turns away:Couched on cold earth, his days are passedWith scanty fare and hermit fast.This moment from his humble bedHe lifts, perhaps, his weary head,And girt by many a follower goesTo bathe where silver Sarjú flows.How, when the frosty morn is dim,Shall Sarjú be a bath for himNursed with all love and tender care,So delicate and young and fair.How bright his hue! his brilliant eyeWith the broad lotus leaf may vie.By fortune stamped for happy fate,His graceful form is tall and straight.In duty skilled, his words are truth:He proudly rules each lust of youth.Though his strong arm smites down the foe,In gentle speech his accents flow.Yet every joy has he resignedAnd cleaves to thee with heart and mind.Thus by the deeds that he has doneA name in heaven has Bharat won,For in his life he follows yetThy steps, O banished anchoret.Thus faithful Bharat, nobly wise,The proverb of the world belies:\"No men, by mothers\\' guidance led,The footsteps of their fathers tread.\"How could Kaikeyí, blest to beSpouse of the king our sire, and seeA son like virtuous Bharat, blotHer glory with so foul a plot!\"Thus in fraternal love he spoke,And from his lips reproaches broke:But Ráma grieved to hear him chideThe absent mother, and replied:\"Cease, O beloved, cease to blameOur royal father second dame.Still speak of Bharat first in placeOf old Ikshváku princely race.My heart, so firmly bent but nowTo dwell in woods and keep my vow,Half melting as I hear thee speakOf Bharat love, grows soft and weak,With tender joy I bring to mindHis speeches ever sweet and kind.That dear as Amrit took the senseWith most enchanting influence.Ah, when shall I, no more to part,Meet Bharat of the mighty heart?When, O my brother, when shall weThe good and brave Satrughna see?\"Thus as he poured his fond lamentThe son of Raghu onward went:They reached the river, and the threeBathed them in fair Godávarí.Libations of the stream they paidTo every deity and shade,With hymns of praise, the Sun on highAnd sinless Gods to glorify.Fresh from the purifying tideResplendent Ráma came,With Lakshman ever by his side,And the sweet Maithil dame.So Rudra shines by worlds adored,In glory undefiled,When Nandi(455) stands beside his lord,And King Himálaya child.(456)Canto XVII. Súrpanakhá.The bathing and the prayer were o\\'er;He turned him from the grassy shore,And with his brother and his spouseSought his fair home beneath the boughs.Sítá and Lakshman by his side,On to his cot the hero hied,And after rites at morning dueWithin the leafy shade withdrew.Then, honoured by the devotees,As royal Ráma sat at ease,With Sítá near him, o\\'er his headA canopy of green boughs spread,He shone as shines the Lord of NightBy Chitrá(457) side, his dear delight.With Lakshman there he sat and toldSweet stories of the days of old,And as the pleasant time he spentWith heart upon each tale intent,A giantess, by fancy led,Came wandering to his leafy shed.Fierce Súrpanakhá,--her of yoreThe Ten-necked tyrant mother bore,--Saw Ráma with his noble mienBright as the Gods in heaven are seen;Him from whose brow a glory gleamed,Like lotus leaves his full eyes beamed:Long-armed, of elephantine gait,With hair close coiled in hermit plait:In youthful vigour, nobly framed,By glorious marks a king proclaimed:Like some bright lotus lustrous-hued,With young Kandarpa(458) grace endued:As there like Indra self he shone,She loved the youth she gazed upon.She grim of eye and foul of faceLoved his sweet glance and forehead grace:She of unlovely figure, himOf stately form and shapely limb:She whose dim locks disordered hung,Him whose bright hair on high brows clung:She whose fierce accents counselled fear,Him whose soft tones were sweet to hear:She whose dire form with age was dried,Him radiant in his youthful pride:She whose false lips maintained the wrong,Him in the words of virtue strong:She cruel-hearted, stained with sin,Him just in deed and pure within.She, hideous fiend, a thing to hate,Him formed each eye to captivate:Fierce passion in her bosom woke,And thus to Raghu son she spoke:\"With matted hair above thy brows,With bow and shaft and this thy spouse,How hast thou sought in hermit dressThe giant-haunted wilderness?What dost thou here? The cause explain:Why art thou come, and what to gain?\"As Súrpanakhá questioned so,Ráma, the terror of the foe,In answer to the monster call,With fearless candour told her all.\"King Dasaratha reigned of old,Like Gods celestial brave and bold.I am his eldest son and heir,And Ráma is the name I bear.This brother, Lakshman, younger born,Most faithful love to me has sworn.My wife, this princess, dear to fame,Is Sitá the Videhan dame.Obedient to my sire behestAnd by the queen my mother pressed,To keep the law and merit win,I sought this wood to harbour in.But speak, for I of thee in turnThy name, and race, and sire would learn.Thou art of giant race, I ween.Changing at will thy form and mien.Speak truly, and the cause declareThat bids thee to these shades repair.\"Thus Ráma spoke: the demon heard,And thus replied by passion spurred:\"Of giant race, what form soe\\'erMy fancy wills, \\'tis mine to wear.Named Súrpanakhá here I stray,And where I walk spread wild dismay.King Rávan is my brother: fameHas taught perchance his dreaded name,Strong Kumbhakarna slumbering deepIn chains of never-ending sleep:Vibhíshan of the duteous mind,In needs unlike his giant kind:Dúshan and Khara, brave and boldWhose fame by every tongue is told:Their might by mine is far surpassed;But when, O best of men, I castThese fond eyes on thy form, I seeMy chosen love and lord in thee.Endowed with wondrous might am I:Where\\'er my fancy leads I fly.The poor misshapen Sítá leave,And me, thy worthier bride receive.Look on my beauty, and preferA spouse more meet than one like her:I\\'ll eat that ill-formed woman there:Thy brother too her fate shall share.But come, beloved, thou shalt roamWith me through all our woodland home;Each varied grove with me shalt seek,And gaze upon each mountain peak.\"As thus she spoke, the monster gazedWith sparkling eyes where passion blazed:Then he, in lore of language learned,This answer eloquent returned:Canto XVIII. The Mutilation.On her ensnared in Káma netHis eyes the royal Ráma set,And thus, her passion to beguile,Addressed her with a gentle smile:\"I have a wife: behold her here,My Sítá ever true and dear:And one like thee will never brookUpon a rival spouse to look.But there my brother Lakshman stands:Unchained is he by nuptial bands:A youth heroic, loved of all,Gracious and gallant, fair and tall.With winning looks, most nobly bred,Unmatched till now, he longs to wed.Meet to enjoy thy youthful charms,O take him to thy loving arms.Enamoured on his bosom lie,Fair damsel of the radiant eye,As the warm sunlight loves to restUpon her darling Meru breast.\"The hero spoke, the monster heard,While passion still her bosom stirred.Away from Ráma side she broke,And thus in turn to Lakshman spoke:\"Come, for thy bride take me who shineIn fairest grace that suits with thine.Thou by my side from grove to groveOf Dandak wild in bliss shalt rove.\"Then Lakshman, skilled in soft address,Wooed by the amorous giantess,With art to turn her love aside,To Súrpanakhá thus replied:\"And can so high a dame agreeThe slave-wife of a slave to be?I, lotus-hued! in good and illAm bondsman to my brother will.Be thou, fair creature radiant-eyed,My honoured brother younger bride:With faultless tint and dainty limb,A happy wife, bring joy to him.He from his spouse grown old and grey,Deformed, untrue, will turn away,Her withered charms will gladly leave,And to his fair young darling cleave.For who could be so fond and blind,O loveliest of all female kind,To love another dame and slightThy beauties rich in all delight?\"Thus Lakshman praised in scornful jestThe long-toothed fiend with loathly breast,Who fondly heard his speech, nor knewHis mocking words were aught but true.Again inflamed with love she fledTo Ráma, in his leafy shedWhere Sítá rested by his side,And to the mighty victor cried:\"What, Ráma, canst thou blindly clingTo this old false misshapen thing?Wilt thou refuse the charms of youthFor withered breast and grinning tooth!Canst thou this wretched creature prizeAnd look on me with scornful eyes?This aged crone this very hourBefore thy face will I devour:Then joyous, from all rivals free.Through Dandak will I stray with thee.\"She spoke, and with a glance of flameRushed on the fawn-eyed Maithil dame:So would a horrid meteor marFair Rohiní soft beaming star.But as the furious fiend drew near,Like Death dire noose which chills with fear,The mighty chief her purpose stayed,And spoke, his brother to upbraid:\"Ne\\'er should we jest with creatures rude,Of savage race and wrathful mood.Think, Lakshman, think how nearly slainMy dear Videhan breathes again.Let not the hideous wretch escapeWithout a mark to mar her shape.Strike, lord of men, the monstrous fiend,Deformed, and foul, and evil-miened.\"He spoke: then Lakshman wrath rose high,And there before his brother eye,He drew that sword which none could stay,And cleft her nose and ears away.Noseless and earless, torn and maimed,With fearful shrieks the fiend exclaimed,And frantic in her wild distressResought the distant wilderness.Deformed, terrific, huge, and dread,As on she moved, her gashes bled,And groan succeeded groan as loudAs roars, ere rain, the thunder cloud.Still on the fearful monster passed,While streams of blood kept falling fast,And with a roar, and arms outspreadWithin the boundless wood she fled.To Janasthán the monster flew;Fierce Khara there she found,With chieftains of the giant crewIn thousands ranged around.Before his awful feet she bentAnd fell with piercing cries,As when a bolt in swift descentComes flashing from the skies.There for a while with senses dazedSilent she lay and scared:At length her drooping head she raised,And all the tale declared,How Ráma, Lakshman, and the dameHad reached that lonely place:Then told her injuries and shame,And showed her bleeding face.Canto XIX. The Rousing Of Khara.When Khara saw his sister lieWith blood-stained limbs and troubled eye,Wild fury in his bosom woke,And thus the monstrous giant spoke;\"Arise, my sister; cast awayThis numbing terror and dismay,And straight the impious hand declareThat marred those features once so fair.For who his finger tip will layOn the black snake in childish play,And unattacked, with idle strokeHis poison-laden fang provoke?Ill-fated fool, he little knowsDeath noose around his neck he throws,Who rashly met thee, and a draughtOf life-destroying poison quaffed.Strong, fierce as death, \\'twas thine to chooseThy way at will, each shape to use;In power and might like one of us:What hand has maimed and marred thee thus?What God or fiend this deed has wrought,What bard or sage of lofty thoughtWas armed with power supremely greatThy form to mar and mutilate?In all the worlds not one I seeWould dare a deed to anger me:Not Indra self, the Thousand-eyed,Beneath whose hand fierce Páka(459) died.My life-destroying darts this dayHis guilty breath shall rend away,E\\'en as the thirsty wild swan drainsEach milk-drop that the wave retains.Whose blood in foaming streams shall burstO\\'er the dry ground which lies athirst,When by my shafts transfixed and slainHe falls upon the battle plain?From whose dead corpse shall birds of airThe mangled flesh and sinews tear,And in their gory feast delight,When I have slain him in the fight?Not God or bard or wandering ghost,No giant of our mighty hostShall step between us, or availTo save the wretch when I assail.Collect each scattered sense, recallThy troubled thoughts, and tell me all.What wretch attacked thee in the way,And quelled thee in victorious fray?\"His breast with burning fury fired,Thus Khara of the fiend inquired:And then with many a tear and sighThus Súrpanakhá made reply:\"\\'Tis Dasaratha sons, a pairStrong, resolute, and young, and fair:In coats of dark and blackdeer hide,And like the radiant lotus eyed:On berries roots and fruit they feed,And lives of saintly virtue lead:With ordered senses undefiled,Ráma and Lakshman are they styled.Fair as the Minstrels\\' King(460) are they,And stamped with signs of regal sway.I know not if the heroes traceTheir line from Gods or Dánav(461) race.There by these wondering eyes betweenThe noble youths a dame was seen,Fair, blooming, young, with dainty waist,And all her bright apparel graced.For her with ready heart and mindThe royal pair their strength combined,And brought me to this last distress,Like some lost woman, comfortless.Perfidious wretch! my soul is fainHer foaming blood and theirs to drain.O let me head the vengeful fight,And with this hand my murderers smite.Come, brother, hasten to fulfilThis longing of my eager will.On to the battle! Let me drinkTheir lifeblood as to earth they sink.\"Then Khara, by his sister pressed,Inflamed with fury, gave his hestTo twice seven giants of his crew,Fierce as the God of death to view:\\'Two men equipped with arms, who wearDeerskin and bark and matted hair,Leading a beauteous dame, have strayedTo the wild gloom of Dandak shade.These men, this cursed woman slay,And hasten back without delay,That this my sister lips may beRed with the lifeblood of the three.Giants, my wounded sister longsTo take this vengeance for her wrongs.With speed her dearest wish fulfil,And with your might these creatures kill.Soon as your matchless strength shall layThese brothers dead in battle fray,She in triumphant joy will laugh,And their hearts\\' blood delighted quaff.\"The giants heard the words he said,And forth with Súrpanakhá sped,As mighty clouds in autumn flyUrged by the wind along the sky.Canto XX. The Giants\\' Death.Fierce Súrpanakhá with her trainTo Ráma dwelling came again,And to the eager giants showedWhere Sítá and the youths abode.Within the leafy cot they spiedThe hero by his consort side,And faithful Lakshman ready stillTo wait upon his brother will.Then noble Ráma raised his eyeAnd saw the giants standing nigh,And then, as nearer still they pressed.His glorious brother thus addressed,\"Be thine a while, my brother dear,To watch o\\'er Sítá safety here,And I will slay these creatures whoThe footsteps of my spouse pursue.\"He spoke, and reverent Lakshman heardSubmissive to his brother word.The son of Raghu, virtuous-souled,Strung his great bow adorned with gold,And, with the weapon in his hand,Addressed him to the giant band:\"Ráma and Lakshman we, who springFrom Dasaratha, mighty king;We dwell a while with Sítá hereIn Dandak forest wild and drear.On woodland roots and fruit we feed,And lives of strictest rule we lead.Say why would ye our lives oppressWho sojourn in the wilderness.Sent hither by the hermits\\' prayerWith bow and darts unused to spare,For vengeance am I come to slayYour sinful band in battle fray.Rest as ye are: remain content,Nor try the battle dire event.Unless your offered lives ye spurn,O rovers of the night, return.\"They listened while the hero spoke,And fury in each breast awoke.The Bráhman-slayers raised on highTheir mighty spears and made reply:They spoke with eyes aglow with ire,While Ráma burnt with vengeful tire,And answered thus, in fury wild,That peerless chief whose tones were mild:\"Nay thou hast angered, overbold,Khara our lord, the mighty-souled,And for thy sin, in battle strifeShalt yield to us thy forfeit life.No power hast thou alone to standAgainst the numbers of our band.\\'Twere vain to match thy single mightAgainst us in the front of fight.When we equipped for fight advanceWith brandished pike and mace and lance,Thou, vanquished in the desperate field,Thy bow, thy strength, thy life shalt yield.\"With bitter words and threatening mienThus furious spoke the fierce fourteen,And raising scimitar and spearOn Ráma rushed in wild career.Their levelled spears the giant crewAgainst the matchless hero threw.His bow the son of Raghu bent,And twice seven shafts to meet them sent,And every javelin sundered fellBy the bright darts he aimed so well.The hero saw: his anger grewTo fury: from his side he drewFresh sunbright arrows pointed keen,In number, like his foes, fourteen.His bow he grasped, the string he drew,And gazing on the giant crew,As Indra casts the levin, soShot forth his arrows at the foe.The hurtling arrows, stained with gore,Through the fiends\\' breasts a passage tore,And in the earth lay buried deepAs serpents through an ant-hill creepLike trees uptorn by stormy blastThe shattered fiends to earth were cast,And there with mangled bodies they,Bathed in their blood and breathless, lay.With fainting heart and furious eyeThe demon saw her champions die.With drying wounds that scarcely bledBack to her brother home she fled.Oppressed with pain, with loud lamentAt Khara feet the monster bent.There like a plant whence slowly comeThe trickling drops of oozy gum,With her grim features pale with painShe poured her tears in ceaseless rain,There routed Súrpanakhá lay,And told her brother all,The issue of the bloody fray,Her giant champions\\' fall.Canto XXI. The Rousing Of Khara.Low in the dust he saw her lie,And Khara wrath grew fierce and high.Aloud he cried to her who cameDisgracefully with baffled aim:\"I sent with thee at thy requestThe bravest of my giants, bestOf all who feed upon the slain:Why art thou weeping here again?Still to their master interest true,My faithful, noble, loyal crew,Though slaughtered in the bloody fray,Would yet their monarch word obey.Now I, my sister, fain would knowThe cause of this thy fear and woe,Why like a snake thou writhest there,Calling for aid in wild despair.Nay, lie not thus in lowly guise:Cast off thy weakness and arise!\"With soothing words the giant chiefAssuaged the fury of her grief.Her weeping eyes she slowly driedAnd to her brother thus replied:\"I sought thee in my shame and fearWith severed nose and mangled ear:My gashes like a river bled,I sought thee and was comforted.Those twice seven giants, brave and strong,Thou sentest to avenge the wrong,To lay the savage Ráma low,And Lakshman who misused me so.But ah, the shafts of Ráma throughThe bodies of my champions flew:Though madly fierce their spears they plied,Beneath his conquering might they died.I saw them, famed for strength and speed,I saw my heroes fall and bleed:Great trembling seized my every limbAt the great deed achieved by him.In trouble, horror, doubt, and dread,Again to thee for help I fled.While terror haunts my troubled sight,I seek thee, rover of the night.And canst thou not thy sister freeFrom this wide waste of troublous seaWhose sharks are doubt and terror, whereEach wreathing wave is dark despair?Low lie on earth thy giant trainBy ruthless Ráma arrows slain,And all the mighty demons, fedOn blood, who followed me are dead.Now if within thy breast may bePity for them and love for me,If thou, O rover of the night,Have valour and with him can fight,Subdue the giants\\' cruel foeWho dwells where Dandak thickets grow.But if thine arm in vain assayThis queller of his foes to slay,Now surely here before thine eyes,Wronged and ashamed thy sister dies.Too well, alas, too well I seeThat, strong in war as thou mayst be,Thou canst not in the battle standWhen Ráma meets thee hand to hand.Go forth, thou hero but in name,Assuming might thou canst not claim;Call friend and kin, no longer stay:Away from Janasthán, away!Shame of thy race! the weak aloneBeneath thine arm may sink o\\'erthrown:Fly Ráma and his brother: theyAre men too strong for thee to slay.How canst thou hope, O weak and base,To make this grove thy dwelling-place?With Ráma might unmeet to vie,O\\'ermastered thou wilt quickly die.A hero strong in valorous deedIs Ráma, Dasaratha seed:And scarce of weaker might than heHis brother chief who mangled me.\"Thus wept and wailed in deep distressThe grim misshapen giantess:Before her brother feet she layO\\'erwhelmed with grief, and swooned away.Canto XXII. Khara Wrath.Roused by the taunting words she spoke,The mighty Khara wrath awoke,And there, while giants girt him round,In these fierce words an utterance found:\"I cannot, peerless one, containMine anger at this high disdain,Galling as salt when sprinkled o\\'erThe rawness of a bleeding sore.Ráma in little count I hold,Weak man whose days are quickly told.The caitiff with his life to-dayFor all his evil deeds shall pay.Dry, sister, dry each needless tear,Stint thy lament and banish fear,For Ráma and his brother goThis day to Yáma realm below.My warrior axe shall stretch him slain,Ere set of sun, upon the plain,Then shall thy sated lips be redWith his warm blood in torrents shed.\"As Khara speech the demon heard,With sudden joy her heart was stirred:She fondly praised him as the boastAnd glory of the giant host.First moved to ire by taunts and stings,Now soothed by gentle flatterings,To Dúshan, who his armies led,The demon Khara spoke, and said:\"Friend, from the host of giants callFull fourteen thousand, best of all,Slaves of my will, of fearful might,Who never turn their backs in fight:Fiends who rejoice to slay and mar,Dark as the clouds of autumn are:Make ready quickly, O my friend,My chariot and the bows I bend.My swords, my shafts of brilliant sheen,My divers lances long and keen.On to the battle will I leadThese heroes of Pulastya seed,And thus, O famed for warlike skill,Ráma my wicked foeman kill.\"He spoke, and ere his speech was done,His chariot glittering like the sun,Yoked and announced, by Dúshan care,With dappled steeds was ready there.High as a peak from Meru rentIt burned with golden ornament:The pole of lazulite, of goldWere the bright wheels whereon it rolled.With gold and moonstone blazoned o\\'er,Fish, flowers, trees, rocks, the panels bore;Auspicious birds embossed thereon,And stars in costly emblem shone.O\\'er flashing swords his banner hung,And sweet bells, ever tinkling, swung.That mighty host with sword and shieldAnd oar was ready for the field:And Khara saw, and Dúshan cried,\"Forth to the fight, ye giants, ride.\"Then banners waved, and shield and swordFlashed as the host obeyed its lord.From Janasthán they sallied outWith eager speed, and din, and shout,Armed with the mace for close attacks,The bill, the spear, the battle-axe,Steel quoit and club that flashed afar,Huge bow and sword and scimitar,The dart to pierce, the bolt to strike,The murderous bludgeon, lance, and pike.So forth from Janasthán, intentOn Khara will, the monsters went.He saw their awful march: not farBehind the host he drove his car.Ware of his master will, to speedThe driver urged each gold-decked steed.Then forth the warrior coursers sprang,And with tumultuous murmur rangEach distant quarter of the skyAnd realms that intermediate lie.High and more high within his breastHis pride triumphant rose,While terrible as Death he pressedOnward to slay his foes,\"More swiftly yet,\" as on they fled,He cried in thundering tonesLoud as a cloud that overheadHails down a flood of stones.Canto XXIII. The Omens.As forth upon its errand wentThat huge ferocious armament,An awful cloud, in dust and gloom,With threatening thunders from its wombPoured in sad augury a floodOf rushing water mixt with blood.The monarch steeds, though strong and fleet,Stumbled and fell: and yet their feetPassed o\\'er the bed of flowers that layFresh gathered on the royal way.No gleam of sunlight struggled throughThe sombre pall of midnight hue,Edged with a line of bloody red,Like whirling torches overhead.A vulture, fierce, of mighty size.Terrific with his cruel eyes,Perched on the staff enriched with gold,Whence hung the flag in many a fold.Each ravening bird, each beast of preyWhere Janasthán wild thickets lay,Rose with a long discordant cryAnd gathered as the host went by.And from the south long, wild, and shrill,Came spirit voices boding ill.Like elephants in frantic mood,Vast clouds terrific, sable-hued,Hid all the sky where\\'er they boreTheir load of water mixt with gore.Above, below, around were spreadThick shades of darkness strange and dread,Nor could the wildered glance descryA point or quarter of the sky.Then came o\\'er heaven a sanguine hue,Though evening flush not yet was due,While each ill-omened bird that fliesAssailed the king with harshest cries.There screamed the vulture and the crane,And the loud jackal shrieked again.Each hideous thing that bodes arightDisaster in the coming fight,With gaping mouth that hissed and flamed,The ruin of the host proclaimed.Eclipse untimely reft awayThe brightness of the Lord of Day,And near his side was seen to glowA mace-like comet boding woe.Then while the sun was lost to viewA mighty wind arose and blew,And stars like fireflies shed their light,Nor waited for the distant night.The lilies drooped, the brooks were dried,The fish and birds that swam them died,And every tree that was so fairWith flower and fruit was stripped and bare.The wild wind ceased, yet, raised on high,Dark clouds of dust involved the sky.In doleful twitter long sustainedThe restless Sárikás(462) complained,And from the heavens with flash and flameTerrific meteors roaring came.Earth to her deep foundation shookWith rock and tree and plain and brook,As Khara with triumphant shout,Borne in his chariot, sallied out.His left arm throbbed: he knew full wellThat omen, and his visage fell.Each awful sign the giant viewed,And sudden tears his eye bedewed.Care on his brow sat chill and black,Yet mad with wrath he turned not back.Upon each fearful sight that raisedThe shuddering hair the chieftain gazed,And laughing in his senseless prideThus to his giant legions cried:\"By sense of mightiest strength upborne,These feeble signs I laugh to scorn.I could bring down the stars that shineIn heaven with these keen shafts of mine.Impelled by warlike fury ICould cause e\\'en Death himself to die.I will not seek my home againUntil my pointed shafts have slainThis Raghu son so fierce in pride,And Lakshman by his brother side.And she, my sister, she for whomThese sons of Raghu meet their doom,She with delighted lips shall drainThe lifeblood of her foemen slain.Fear not for me: I ne\\'er have knownDefeat, in battle overthrown.Fear not for me, O giants; trueAre the proud words I speak to you.The king of Gods who rules on high,If wild Airávat bore him nigh,Should fall before me bolt in hand:And shall these two my wrath withstand!\"He ended and the giant hostWho heard their chief triumphant boast,Rejoiced with equal pride elate,Entangled in the noose of Fate.Then met on high in bright array,With eyes that longed to see the fray,God and Gandharva, sage and saint,With beings pure from earthly taint.Blest for good works aforetime wrought,Thus each to other spake his thought:\"Now joy to Bráhmans, joy to kine,And all whom world count half divine!May Raghu offspring slay in fightPulastya sons who roam by night!\"In words like these and more, the bestOf high-souled saints their hopes expressed,Bending their eager eyes from whereCar-borne with Gods they rode in air.Beneath them stretching far, they viewedThe giants\\' death-doomed multitude.They saw where, urged with fury, farBefore the host rolled Khara car,And close beside their leader cameTwelve giant peers of might and fame.Four other chiefs(463) before the restBehind their leader Dúshan pressed.Impetuous, cruel, dark, and dread,All thirsting for the fray,The hosts of giant warriors spedOnward upon their way.With eager speed they reached the spotWhere dwelt the princely two,--Like planets in a league to blotThe sun and moon from view.Canto XXIV. The Host In Sight.While Khara, urged by valiant rage,Drew near that little hermitage,Those wondrous signs in earth and skySmote on each prince watchful eye.When Ráma saw those signs of woeFraught with destruction to the foe,With bold impatience scarce repressedHis brother chief he thus addressed:\"These fearful signs, my brother bold,Which threaten all our foes, behold:All laden, as they strike the view,With ruin to the fiendish crew.The angry clouds are gathering fast,Their skirts with dusty gloom o\\'ercast,And harsh with loud-voiced thunder, rainThick drops of blood upon the plain.See, burning for the coming fight,My shafts with wreaths of smoke are white,And my great bow embossed with goldThrobs eager for the master hold.Each bird that through the forest fliesSends out its melancholy cries.All signs foretell the dangerous strife,The jeopardy of limb and life.Each sight, each sound gives warning clearThat foemen meet and death is near.But courage, valiant brother! wellThe throbbings of mine arm foretellThat ruin waits the hostile powers,And triumph in the fight is ours.I hail the welcome omen: thouArt bright of face and clear of brow.For Lakshman, when the eye can traceA cloud upon the warrior faceStealing the cheerful light away,His life is doomed in battle fray.List, brother, to that awful cry:With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh.With thundering beat of many a drumThe savage-hearted giants come.The wise who value safety knowTo meet, prepared, the coming blow:In paths of prudence trained arightThey watch the stroke before it smite.Take thou thine arrows and thy bow,And with the Maithil lady goFor shelter to the mountain caveWhere thickest trees their branches wave.I will not have thee, Lakshman, sayOne word in answer, but obey.By all thy honour for these feetOf mine, dear brother, I entreat.Thy warlike arm, I know could, smiteTo death these rovers of the night;But I this day would fight aloneTill all the fiends be overthrown.\"He spake: and Lakshman answered naught:His arrows and his bow he brought,And then with Sítá following hiedFor shelter to the mountain side.As Lakshman and the lady throughThe forest to the cave withdrew,\"\\'Tis well,\" cried Ráma. Then he bracedHis coat of mail around his waist.When, bright as blazing fire, uponHis mighty limbs that armour shone,The hero stood like some great lightUprising in the dark of night.His dreadful shafts were by his side;His trusty bow he bent and plied,Prepared he stood: the bowstring rang,Filling the welkin with the clang.The high-souled Gods together drewThe wonder of the fight to view,The saints made free from spot and stain,And bright Gandharvas\\' heavenly train.Each glorious sage the assembly sought,Each saint divine of loftiest thought,And filled with zeal for Ráma sake.Thus they whose deeds were holy spake:\"Now be it well with Bráhmans, nowWell with the worlds and every cow!Let Ráma in the deadly frayThe fiends who walk in darkness slay,As He who bears the discus(464) slewThe chieftains of the Asur crew.\"Then each with anxious glances viewedHis fellow and his speech renewed:\"There twice seven thousand giants standWith impious heart and cruel hand:Here Ráma stands, by virtue known:How can the hero fight alone?\"Thus royal sage and Bráhman saint,Spirit, and Virtue free from taint,And all the Gods of heaven who rodeOn golden cars, their longing showed.Their hearts with doubt and terror rent,They saw the giants\\' armament,And Ráma clothed in warrior might,Forth standing in the front of fight.Lord of the arm no toil might tire,He stood majestic in his ire,Matchless in form as Rudra(465) whenHis wrath is fierce on Gods or men.While Gods and saints in close arrayHeld converse of the coming fray,The army of the fiends drew nearWith sight and sound that counselled fear.Long, loud and deep their war-cry pealed,As on they rushed with flag and shield,Each, of his proper valour proud,Urging to fight the demon crowd.His ponderous bow each warrior tried,And swelled his bulk with martial pride.\\'Mid shout and roar and trampling feet,And thunder of the drums they beat,Loud and more loud the tumult wentThroughout the forest vast extent,And all the life that moved withinThe woodland trembled at the din.In eager haste all fled to findSome tranquil spot, nor looked behind.With every arm of war supplied,On-rushing wildly like the tideOf some deep sea, the giant hostApproached where Ráma kept his post.Then he, in battle skilled and tried,Bent his keen eye on every side,And viewed the host of Khara faceTo face before his dwelling-place.He drew his arrows forth, and rearedAnd strained that bow which foemen feared,And yielded to the vengeful swayOf fierce desire that host to slay.Terrific as the ruinous fireThat ends the worlds, he glowed in ire,And his tremendous form dismayedThe Gods who roam the forest shade.For in the furious wrath that glowedWithin his soul the hero showedLike Siva when his angry mightStayed Daksha sacrificial rite.(466)Like some great cloud at dawn of dayWhen first the sun upsprings,And o\\'er the gloomy mass each rayA golden radiance flings:Thus showed the children of the night,Whose mail and chariots threw,With gleam of bows and armlets bright,Flashes of flamy hue.Canto XXV. The Battle.When Khara with the hosts he ledDrew near to Ráma leafy shed,He saw that queller of the foeStand ready with his ordered bow.He saw, and burning at the viewHis clanging bow he raised and drew,And bade his driver urge apaceHis car to meet him face to face.Obedient to his master hestHis eager steeds the driver pressedOn to the spot where, none to aid,The strong-armed chief his weapon swayed.Soon as the children of the nightSaw Khara rushing to the fight,His lords with loud unearthly cryFollowed their chief and gathered nigh.As in his car the leader rodeWith all his lords around, he showedLike the red planet fiery MarsSurrounded by the lesser stars.Then with a horrid yell that rentThe air, the giant chieftain sentA thousand darts in rapid showerOn Ráma matchless in his power.The rovers of the night, impelledBy fiery rage which naught withheld,Upon the unconquered prince, who strainedHis fearful bow, their arrows rained.With sword and club, with mace and pike,With spear and axe to pierce and strike,Those furious fiends on every sideThe unconquerable hero plied.The giant legions huge and strong,Like clouds the tempest drives along,Rushed upon Ráma with the speedOf whirling car, and mounted steed,And hill-like elephant, to slayThe matchless prince in battle fray.Then upon Ráma thick and fastThe rain of mortal steel they cast,As labouring clouds their torrents shedUpon the mountain-monarch(467) head.As near and nearer round him drewThe warriors of the giant crew,He showed like Siva girt by allHis spirits when night shadows fall.As the great deep receives each rillAnd river rushing from the hill,He bore that flood of darts, and brokeWith well-aimed shaft each murderous stroke.By stress of arrowy storm assailed,And wounded sore, he never failed,Like some high mountain which defiesThe red bolts flashing from the skies.With ruddy streams each limb was dyedFrom gaping wounds in breast and side,Showing the hero like the sun\\'Mid crimson clouds ere day is done.Then, at that sight of terror, faintGrew God, Gandharva, sage, and saint,Trembling to see the prince opposeHis single might to myriad foes.But waxing wroth, with force unspent,He strained his bow to utmost bent,And forth his arrows keen and trueIn hundreds, yea in thousands flew,--Shafts none could ward, and none endure:Death fatal noose was scarce so sure.As \\'twere in playful ease he shotHis gilded shafts, and rested not.With swiftest flight and truest aimUpon the giant hosts they came.Each smote, each stayed a foeman breathAs fatal as the coil of Death.Each arrow through a giant toreA passage, and besmeared with gore,Pursued its onward way and throughThe air with flamy brilliance flew.Unnumbered were the arrows sentFrom the great bow which Ráma bent,And every shaft with iron headThe lifeblood of a giant shed.Their pennoned bows were cleft, nor mailNor shield of hide could aught avail.For Ráma myriad arrows toreThrough arms, and bracelets which they wore,And severed mighty warriors\\' thighsLike trunks of elephants in size,And cut resistless passage sheerThrough gold-decked horse and charioteer,Slew elephant and rider, slewThe horseman and the charger too,And infantry unnumbered sentTo dwell \\'neath Yáma government.Then rose on high a fearful yellOf rovers of the night, who fellBeneath that iron torrent, soreWounded by shafts that rent and tore.So mangled by the ceaseless stormOf shafts of every kind and form,Such joy they found, as forests feelWhen scorched by flame, from Ráma steel.The mightiest still the fight maintained,And furious upon Ráma rainedDart, arrow, spear, with wild attacksOf mace, and club, and battle-axe.But the great chief, unconquered yet,Their weapons with his arrows met,Which severed many a giant head,And all the plain with corpses spread.With sundered bow and shattered shieldHeadless they sank upon the field,As the tall trees, that felt the blastOf Garud wing, to earth were cast.The giants left unslaughtered thereWhere filled with terror and despair,And to their leader Khara fledFaint, wounded, and discomfited.These fiery Dúshan strove to cheer,And poised his bow to calm their fear;Then fierce as He who rules the dead,When wroth, on angered Ráma sped.By Dúshan cheered, the demons castTheir dread aside and rallied fastWith Sáls, rocks, palm-trees in their handsWith nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,Again upon the godlike manThe mighty fiends infuriate ran,These casting rocks like hail, and theseA whelming shower of leafy trees.Wild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,And raise on end each shuddering hair,As with the fiends who loved to roveBy night heroic Ráma strove!The giants in their fury pliedRáma with darts on every side.Then, by the gathering demons pressedFrom north and south and east and west,By showers of deadly darts assailedFrom every quarter fiercely hailed,Girt by the foes who swarmed around,He raised a mighty shout whose soundStruck terror. On the giant crewHis great Gandharva(468) arrow flew.A thousand mortal shafts were rainedFrom the orbed bow the hero strained,Till east and west and south and northWere filled with arrows volleyed forth.They heard the fearful shout: they sawHis mighty hand the bowstring draw,Yet could no wounded giant eyeSee the swift storm of arrows fly.Still firm the warrior stood and castHis deadly missiles thick and fast.Dark grew the air with arrowy hailWhich hid the sun as with a veil.Fiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,All in a moment, spread the plain,And thousands scarce alive were leftMangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft.Dire was the sight, the plain o\\'erspreadWith trophies of the mangled dead.There lay, by Ráma missiles rent,Full many a priceless ornament,With severed limb and broken gem,Hauberk and helm and diadem.There lay the shattered car, the steed,The elephant of noblest breed,The splintered spear, the shivered mace,Chouris and screens to shade the face.The giants saw with bitterest painTheir warriors weltering on the plain,Nor dared again his might opposeWho scourged the cities of his foes.Canto XXVI. Dúshan Death.When Dúshan saw his giant bandSlaughtered by Ráma conquering hand,He called five thousand fiends, and gaveHis orders. Bravest of the brave,Invincible, of furious might,Ne\\'er had they turned their backs in flight.They, as their leader bade them seizeSpears, swords, and clubs, and rocks, and trees,Poured on the dauntless prince againA ceaseless shower of deadly rain.The virtuous Ráma, undismayed,Their missiles with his arrows stayed,And weakened, ere it fell, the shockOf that dire hail of tree and rock,And like a bull with eyelids closed,The pelting of the storm opposed.Then blazed his ire: he longed to smiteTo earth the rovers of the night.The wrath that o\\'er his spirit cameClothed him with splendour as of flame,While showers of mortal darts he pouredFierce on the giants and their lord.Dúshan, the foeman dusky dread,By frenzied rage inspirited,On Raghu son his missiles castLike Indra bolts which rend and blast.But Ráma with a trenchant dartCleft Dúshan ponderous bow apart.And then the gold-decked steeds who drewThe chariot, with four shafts he slew.One crescent dart he aimed which shredClean from his neck the driver head;Three more with deadly skill addressedStood quivering in the giant breast.Hurled from his car, steeds, driver slain,The bow he trusted cleft in twain,He seized his mace, strong, heavy, dread,High as a mountain towering head.With plates of gold adorned and bound,Embattled Gods it crushed and ground.Its iron spikes yet bore the stainsOf mangled foemen blood and brains.Its heavy mass of jagged steelWas like a thunderbolt to feel.It shattered, as on foes it fell,The city where the senses dwell.(469)Fierce Dúshan seized that ponderous maceLike monstrous form of serpent race,And all his savage soul aglowWith fury, rushed upon the foe.But Raghu son took steady aim,And as the rushing giant came,Shore with two shafts the arms whereonThe demon glittering bracelets shone.His arm at each huge shoulder lopped,The mighty body reeled and dropped,And the great mace to earth was thrownLike Indra staff when storms have blown.As some vast elephant who liesShorn of his tusks, and bleeding dies,So, when his arms were rent away,Low on the ground the giant lay.The spirits saw the monster die,And loudly rang their joyful cry,\"Honour to Ráma! nobly done!Well hast thou fought, Kakutstha son!\"But the great three, the host who led,Enraged to see their chieftain dead,As though Death toils were round them cast,Rushed upon Ráma fierce and fast,Mahákapála seized, to strikeHis foeman down, a ponderous pike:Sthúláksha charged with spear to fling,Pramáthi with his axe to swing.When Ráma saw, with keen darts heReceived the onset of the three,As calm as though he hailed a guestIn each, who came for shade and rest.Mahákapála monstrous headFell with the trenchant dart he sped.His good right hand in battle skilledSthúláksha eyes with arrows filled,And trusting still his ready bowHe laid the fierce Pramáthi low,Who sank as some tall tree falls downWith bough and branch and leafy crown.Then with five thousand shafts he slewThe rest of Dúshan giant crew:Five thousand demons, torn and rent,To Yáma gloomy realm he sent.When Khara knew the fate of allThe giant band and Dúshan fall,He called the mighty chiefs who ledHis army, and in fury said:\"Now Dúshan and his armčd trainLie prostrate on the battle plain.Lead forth an army mightier still,Ráma this wretched man, to kill.Fight ye with darts of every shape,Nor let him from your wrath escape.\"Thus spoke the fiend, by rage impelled,And straight his course toward Ráma held.With Syenagámí and the restOf his twelve chiefs he onward pressed,And every giant as he wentA storm of well-wrought arrows sent.Then with his pointed shafts that cameWith gold and diamond bright as flame,Dead to the earth the hero threwThe remnant of the demon crew.Those shafts with feathers bright as gold,Like flames which wreaths of smoke enfold,Smote down the fiends like tall trees rentBy red bolts from the firmament.A hundred shafts he pointed well:By their keen barbs a hundred fell:A thousand,--and a thousand moreIn battle front lay drenched in gore.Of all defence and guard bereft,With sundered bows and harness cleft.Their bodies red with bloody stainFell the night-rovers on the plain,Which, covered with the loosened hairOf bleeding giants prostrate there,Like some great altar showed, arrayedFor holy rites with grass o\\'erlaid.The darksome wood, each glade and dellWhere the wild demons fought and fellWas like an awful hell whose floorIs thick with mire and flesh and gore.Thus twice seven thousand fiends, a bandWith impious heart and bloody hand,By Raghu son were overthrown,A man, on foot, and all alone.Of all who met on that fierce day,Khara, great chief, survived the fray,The monster of the triple head,(470)And Raghu son, the foeman dread.The other demon warriors, allSkilful and brave and strong and tall,In front of battle, side by side,Struck down by Lakshman brother died.When Khara saw the host he ledTriumphant forth to fightStretched on the earth, all smitten dead,By Ráma nobler might,Upon his foe he fiercely glared,And drove against him fast,Like Indra when his arm is baredHis thundering bolt to cast.Canto XXVII. The Death Of Trisirás.But Trisirás,(471) a chieftain dread,Marked Khara as he onward sped.And met his car and cried, to stayThe giant from the purposed fray:\"Mine be the charge: let me attack,And turn thee from the contest back.Let me go forth, and thou shalt seeThe strong-armed Ráma slain by me.True are the words I speak, my lord:I swear it as I touch my sword:That I this Ráma blood will spill,Whom every giant hand should kill.This Ráma will I slay, or heIn battle fray shall conquer me.Restrain thy spirit: check thy car,And view the combat from afar.Thou, joying o\\'er the prostrate foe,To Janasthán again shalt go,Or, if I fall in battle chance,Against my conqueror advance.\"Thus Trisirás for death who yearned:And Khara from the conflict turned,\"Go forth to battle,\" Khara cried;And toward his foe the giant hied.Borne on a car of glittering hueWhich harnessed coursers fleetly drew,Like some huge hill with triple peakHe onward rushed the prince to seek.Still, like a big cloud, sending outHis arrowy rain with many a shoutLike the deep sullen roars that comeDiscordant from a moistened drum.But Raghu son, whose watchful eyeBeheld the demon rushing nigh,From the great bow he raised and bentA shower of shafts to meet him sent.Wild grew the fight and wilder yetAs fiend and man in combat met,As when in some dark wood retreatAn elephant and a lion meet.The giant bent his bow, and trueTo Ráma brow three arrows flew.Then, raging as he felt the stroke,These words in anger Ráma spoke:\"Heroic chief! is such the powerOf fiends who rove at midnight hour?Soft as the touch of flowers I feelThe gentle blows thine arrows deal.Receive in turn my shafts, and knowWhat arrows fly from Ráma bow.\"Thus as he spoke his wrath grew hot,And twice seven deadly shafts he shot,Which, dire as serpent deadly fang,Straight to the giant bosom sprang.Four arrows more,--each shaped to dealA mortal wound with barbčd steel,--The glorious hero shot, and slewThe four good steeds the car that drew.Eight other shafts flew straight and fleet,And hurled the driver from his seat,And in the dust the banner laidThat proudly o\\'er the chariot played.Then as the fiend prepared to boundForth from his useless car to ground,The hero smote him to the heart,And numbed his arm with deadly smart.Again the chieftain, peerless-souled,Sent forth three rapid darts, and rolledWith each keen arrow, deftly sped,Low in the dust a monstrous head.Then yielding to each deadly stroke,Forth spouting streams of blood and smoke,The headless trunk bedrenched with goreFell to the ground and moved no more.The fiends who yet were left with life,Routed and crushed in battle strife,To Khara side, like trembling deerScared by the hunter, fled in fear.King Khara saw with furious eyeHis scattered giants turn and fly;Then rallying his broken trainAt Raghu son he drove amain,Like Ráhu(472) when his deadly mightComes rushing on the Lord of Night.Canto XXVIII. Khara Dismounted.But when he turned his eye where bledBoth Trisirás and Dúshan dead,Fear o\\'er the giant spirit cameOf Ráma might which naught could tame.He saw his savage legions, thoseWhose force no creature dared oppose,--He saw the leader of his trainBy Ráma single prowess slain.With burning grief he marked the fewStill left him of his giant crew.As Namuchi(473) on Indra, soRushed the dread demon on his foe.His mighty bow the monster strained,And angrily on Ráma rainedHis mortal arrows in a flood,Like serpent fangs athirst for blood.Skilled in the bowman warlike art,He plied the string and poised the dart.Here, on his car, and there, he rode,And passages of battle showed,While all the skyey regions grewDark with his arrows as they flew.Then Ráma seized his ponderous bow,And straight the heaven was all aglowWith shafts whose stroke no life might bearThat filled with flash and flame the air,Thick as the blinding torrents sentDown from Parjanya(474) firmament.In space itself no space remained,But all was filled with arrows rainedIncessantly from each great bowWielded by Ráma and his foe.As thus in furious combat, wroughtTo mortal hate, the warriors fought,The sun himself grew faint and pale,Obscured behind that arrowy veil.As when beneath the driver steelAn elephant is forced to kneel,So from the hard and pointed headOf many an arrow Ráma bled.High on his car the giant rosePrepared in deadly strife to close,And all the spirits saw him standLike Yáma with his noose in hand.For Khara deemed in senseless prideThat he, beneath whose hand had diedThe giant legions, failed at lengthSlow sinking with exhausted strength.But Ráma, like a lion, whenA trembling deer comes nigh his den,Feared not the demon mad with hate,--Of lion might and lion gait.Then in his lofty car that glowedWith sunlike brilliance Khara rodeAt Ráma: madly on he cameLike a poor moth that seeks the flame.His archer skill the fiend displayed,And at the place where Ráma laidHis hand, an arrow cleft in twoThe mighty bow the hero drew.Seven arrows by the giant sent,Bright as the bolts of Indra, rentTheir way through mail and harness joints,And pierced him with their iron points.On Ráma, hero unsurpassed,A thousand shafts smote thick and fast,While as each missile struck, rang outThe giant awful battle-shout.His knotted arrows pierced and toreThe sunbright mail the hero wore,Till, band and buckle rent away,Glittering on the ground it lay.Then pierced in shoulder, breast, and side,Till every limb with blood was dyed,The chieftain in majestic ireShone glorious as the smokeless fire.Then loud and long the war-cry roseOf Ráma, terror of his foes,As, on the giant death intent,A ponderous bow he strung and bent,--Lord Vishnu own, of wondrous size,--Agastya gave the heavenly prize.Then rushing on the demon foe,He raised on high that mighty bow,And with his well-wrought shafts, whereonBright gold between the feathers shone,He struck the pennon fluttering o\\'erThe chariot, and it waved no more.That glorious flag whose every foldWas rich with blazonry and gold,Fell as the sun himself by allThe Gods\\' decree might earthward fall.From wrathful Khara hand, whose artWell knew each vulnerable part,Four keenly-piercing arrows flew,And blood in Ráma bosom drew,With every limb distained with goreFrom deadly shafts which rent and tore,From Khara clanging bowstring shots,The prince wrath waxed wondrous hot.His hand upon his bow that bestOf mighty archers firmly pressed,And from the well-drawn bowstring, trueEach to its mark, six arrows flew.One quivered in the giant head,With two his brawny shoulders bled;Three, with the crescent heads they bore,Deep in his breast a passage tore.Thirteen, to which the stone had lentThe keenest point, were swiftly sentOn the fierce giant, every oneDestructive, gleaming like the sun.With four the dappled steeds he slew;One cleft the chariot yoke in two,One, in the heat of battle sped,Smote from the neck the driver head.The poles were rent apart by three;Two broke the splintered axle-tree.Then from the hand of Ráma, whileAcross his lips there came a smile,The twelfth, like thunderbolt impelled,Cut the great hand and bow it held.Then, scarce by Indra self surpassed,He pierced the giant with the last.The bow he trusted cleft in twain,His driver and his horses slain,Down sprang the giant, mace in hand,On foot against the foe to stand.The Gods and saints in bright arrayClose gathered in the skies,The prince might in battle-frayBeheld with joyful eyes.Uprising from their golden seats,Their hands in honour raised,They looked on Ráma noble feats,And blessed him as they praised.Canto XXIX. Khara Defeat.When Ráma saw the giant nigh,On foot, alone, with mace reared high,In mild reproof at first he spoke,Then forth his threatening anger broke:\"Thou with the host \\'twas thine to lead,With elephant and car and steed,Hast wrought an act of sin and shame,An act which all who live must blame.Know that the wretch whose evil mindJoys in the grief of human kind,Though the three worlds confess him lord,Must perish dreaded and abhorred.Night-rover, when a villain deedsDistress the world he little heeds,Each hand is armed his life to take,And crush him like a deadly snake.The end is near when men beginThrough greed or lust a life of sin,E\\'en as a Bráhman dame, unwise,Eats of the fallen hail(475) and dies.Thy hand has slain the pure and good,The hermit saints of Dandak wood,Of holy life, the heirs of bliss;And thou shalt reap the fruit of this.Not long shall they whose cruel breastsJoy in the sin the world detestsRetain their guilty power and pride,But fade like trees whose roots are dried.Yes, as the seasons come and go,Each tree its kindly fruit must show,And sinners reap in fitting timeThe harvest of each earlier crime.As those must surely die who eatUnwittingly of poisoned meat,They too whose lives in sin are spentReceive ere long the punishment.And know, thou rover of the night,That I, a king, am sent to smiteThe wicked down, who court the hateOf men whose laws they violate.This day my vengeful hand shall sendShafts bright with gold to tear and rend,And pass with fury through thy breastAs serpents pierce an emmet nest.Thou with thy host this day shalt beAmong the dead below, and seeThe saints beneath thy hand who bled,Whose flesh thy cruel maw has fed.They, glorious on their seats of gold,Their slayer shall in hell behold.Fight with all strength thou callest thine,Mean scion of ignoble line,Still, like the palm-tree fruit, this dayMy shafts thy head in dust shall lay.\"Such were the words that Ráma said:Then Khara eyes with wrath glowed red,Who, maddened by the rage that burnedWithin him, with a smile returned:\"Thou Dasaratha son, hast slainThe meaner giants of my train:And canst thou idly vaunt thy mightAnd claim the praise not thine by right?Not thus in self-laudation raveThe truly great, the nobly brave:No empty boasts like thine disgraceThe foremost of the human race.The mean of soul, unknown to fame,Who taint their warrior race with shame,Thus speak in senseless pride as thou,O Raghu son, hast boasted now.What hero, when the war-cry rings,Vaunts the high race from which he springs,Or seeks, when warriors meet and die,His own descent to glorify?Weakness and folly show confessedIn every vaunt thou utterest,As when the flames fed high with grassDetect the simulating brass.Dost thou not see me standing hereArmed with the mighty mace I rear,Firm as an earth upholding hillWhose summit veins of metal fill?Lo, here I stand before thy faceTo slay thee with my murderous mace,As Death, the universal lord,Stands threatening with his fatal cord.Enough of this. Much more remainsThat should be said: but time constrains.Ere to his rest the sun descend,And shades of night the combat end,The twice seven thousand of my bandWho fell beneath thy bloody handShall have their tears all wiped awayAnd triumph in thy fall to-day.\"He spoke, and loosing from his holdHis mighty mace ringed round with gold,Like some red bolt alive with fireHurled it at Ráma, mad with ire.The ponderous mace which Khara threwSent fiery flashes as it flew.Trees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,As onward to its aim it passed.But Ráma, watching as it spedDire as His noose who rules the dead,Cleft it with arrows as it cameOn rushing with a hiss and flame.Its fury spent and burnt away,Harmless upon the ground it layLike a great snake in furious moodBy herbs of numbing power subdued.Canto XXX. Khara Death.When Ráma, pride of Raghu race,Virtue dear son, had cleft the mace,Thus with superior smile the bestOf chiefs the furious fiend addressed:\"Thou, worst of giant blood, at lengthHast shown the utmost of thy strength,And forced by greater might to bow,Thy vaunting threats are idle now.My shafts have cut thy club in twain:Useless it lies upon the plain,And all thy pride and haughty trustLie with it levelled in the dust.The words that thou hast said to-day,That thou wouldst wipe the tears awayOf all the giants I have slain,My deeds shall render void and vain.Thou meanest of the giants\\' breed,Evil in thought and word and deed,My hand shall take that life of thineAs Garud(476) seized the juice divine.Thou, rent by shafts, this day shalt die:Low on the ground thy corse shall lie,And bubbles from the cloven neckWith froth and blood thy skin shall deck.With dust and mire all rudely dyed,Thy torn arms lying by thy side,While streams of blood each limb shall steep,Thou on earth breast shalt take thy sleepLike a fond lover when he strainsThe beauty whom at length he gains.Now when thy heavy eyelids closeFor ever in thy deep repose,Again shall Dandak forest beSafe refuge for the devotee.Thou slain, and all thy race who heldThe realm of Janasthán expelled,Again shall happy hermits rove,Fearing no danger, through the grove.Within those bounds, their brethren slain,No giant shall this day remain,But all shall fly with many a tearAnd fearing, rid the saints of fear.This bitter day shall misery bringOn all the race that calls thee king.Fierce as their lord, thy dames shall know,Bereft of joys, the taste of woe.Base, cruel wretch, of evil mind,Plaguer of Bráhmans and mankind,With trembling hands each devoteeFeeds holy fires in dread of thee.\"Thus with wild fury unrepressedRaghu brave son the fiend addressed;And Khara, as his wrath grew high,Thus thundered forth his fierce reply:\"By senseless pride to madness wrought,By danger girt thou fearest naught,Nor heedest, numbered with the dead,What thou shouldst say and leave unsaid.When Fate tremendous coils enfoldThe captive in resistless hold,He knows not right from wrong, each senseNumbed by that deadly influence.\"He spoke, and when his speech was doneBent his fierce brows on Raghu son.With eager eyes he looked aroundIf lethal arms might yet be found.Not far away and full in viewA Sál-tree towering upward grew.His lips in mighty strain compressed,He tore it up with root and crest,With huge arms waved it o\\'er his headAnd hurled it shouting, Thou art dead.But Ráma, unsurpassed in might,Stayed with his shafts its onward flight,And furious longing seized his soulThe giant in the dust to roll.Great drops of sweat each limb bedewed,His red eyes showed his wrathful mood.A thousand arrows, swiftly sent,The giant bosom tore and rent.From every gash his body showedThe blood in foamy torrents flowed,As springing from their caverns leapSwift rivers down the mountain steep.When Khara felt each deadened powerYielding beneath that murderous shower,He charged, infuriate with the scentOf blood, in dire bewilderment.But Ráma watched, with ready bow,The onset of his bleeding foe,And ere the monster reached him, drewBackward in haste a yard or two.Then from his side a shaft he tookWhose mortal stroke no life might brook:Of peerless might, it bore the nameOf Brahmá staff, and glowed with flame:Lord Indra, ruler of the skies,Himself had given the glorious prize.His bow the virtuous hero drew,And at the fiend the arrow flew.Hissing and roaring like the blastOf tempest through the air it passed,And fixed, by Ráma vigour sped,In the foe breast its pointed head.Then fell the fiend: the quenchless flameBurnt furious in his wounded frame.So burnt by Rudra Andhak(477) fellIn Svetáranya silvery dell:So Namuchi and Vritra(478) diedBy steaming bolts that tamed their pride:So Bala(479) fell by lightning sentBy Him who rules the firmament.Then all the Gods in close arrayWith the bright hosts who sing and play,Filled full of rapture and amaze,Sang hymns of joy in Ráma praise,Beat their celestial drums and shedRain of sweet flowers upon his head.For three short hours had scarcely flown,And by his pointed shafts o\\'erthrownThe twice seven thousand fiends, whose willCould change their shapes, in death were still,With Trisirás and Dúshan slain,And Khara, leader of the train.\"O wondrous deed,\" the bards began,\"The noblest deed of virtuous man!Heroic strength that stood alone,And firmness e\\'en as Vishnu own!\"Thus having sung, the shining trainTurned to their heavenly homes again.Then the high saints of royal raceAnd loftiest station sought the place,And by the great Agastya led,With reverence to Ráma said:\"For this, Lord Indra, glorious sire,Majestic as the burning fire,Who crushes cities in his rage,Sought Sarabhanga hermitage.Thou wast, this great design to aid,Led by the saints to seek this shade,And with thy mighty arm to killThe giants who delight in ill.Thou Dasaratha noble son,The battle for our sake hast won,And saints in Dandak wild who liveTheir days to holy tasks can give.\"Forth from the mountain cavern cameThe hero Lakshman with the dame.And rapture beaming from his face,Resought the hermit dwelling-place.Then when the mighty saints had paidDue honour for the victor aid,The glorious Ráma honoured tooBy Lakshman to his cot withdrew.When Sítá looked upon her lord,His foemen slain, the saints restored,In pride and rapture uncontrolledShe clasped him in her loving hold.On the dead fiends her glances fell:She saw her lord alive and well,Victorious after toil and pain,And Janak child was blest again.Once more, once more with new delightHer tender arms she threwRound Ráma whose victorious mightHad crushed the demon crew.Then as his grateful reverence paidEach saint of lofty soul,O\\'er her sweet face, all fears allayed,The flush of transport stole.Canto XXXI. Rávan.But of the host of giants one,Akampan, from the field had runAnd sped to Lanká(480) to relateIn Rávan ear the demons\\' fate:\"King, many a giant from the shadeOf Janasthán in death is laid:Khara the chief is slain, and ICould scarcely from the battle fly.\"Fierce anger, as the monarch heard,Inflamed his look, his bosom stirred,And while with scorching glance he eyedThe messenger, he thus replied:\"What fool has dared, already dead,Strike Janasthán, the general dread?Who is the wretch shall vainly tryIn earth, heaven, hell, from me to fly?Vaisravan,(481) Indra, Vishnu, HeWho rules the dead, must reverence me;For not the mightiest lord of theseCan brave my will and live at ease.Fate finds in me a mightier fateTo burn the fires that devastate.With unresisted influence ICan force e\\'en Death himself to die,With all-surpassing might restrainThe fury of the hurricane,And burn in my tremendous ireThe glory of the sun and fire.\"As thus the fiend hot fury blazed,His trembling hands Akampan raised,And with a voice which fear made weak,Permission craved his tale to speak.King Rávan gave the leave he sought,And bade him tell the news he brought.His courage rose, his voice grew bold,And thus his mournful tale he told:\"A prince with mighty shoulders, sprungFrom Dasaratha, brave and young,With arms well moulded, bears the nameOf Ráma with a lion frame.Renowned, successful, dark of limb,Earth has no warrior equals him.He fought in Janasthán and slewDúshan the fierce and Khara too.\"Rávan the giants\\' royal chief.Received Akampan tale of grief.Then, panting like an angry snake,These words in turn the monarch spake:\"Say quick, did Ráma seek the shadeOf Janasthán with Indra aid,And all the dwellers in the skiesTo back his hardy enterprise?\"Akampan heard, and straight obeyedHis master, and his answer made.Then thus the power and might he toldOf Raghu son the lofty-souled:\"Best is that chief of all who knowWith deftest art to draw the bow.His are strange arms of heavenly might,And none can match him in the fight.His brother Lakshman brave as he,Fair as the rounded moon to see,With eyes like night and voice that comesDeep as the roll of beaten drums,By Ráma side stands ever near,Like wind that aids the flame career.That glorious chief, that prince of kings,On Janasthán this ruin brings.No Gods were there,--dismiss the thoughtNo heavenly legions came and fought.His swift-winged arrows Ráma sent,Each bright with gold and ornament.To serpents many-faced they turned:The giant hosts they ate and burned.Where\\'er these fled in wild dismayRáma was there to strike and slay.By him O King of high estate,Is Janasthán left desolate.\"Akampan ceased: in angry prideThe giant monarch thus replied:\"To Janasthán myself will goAnd lay these daring brothers low.\"Thus spoke the king in furious mood:Akampan then his speech renewed:\"O listen while I tell at lengthThe terror of the hero strength.No power can check, no might can tameRáma, a chief of noblest fame.He with resistless shafts can stayThe torrent foaming on its way.Sky, stars, and constellations, allTo his fierce might would yield and fall.His power could earth itself upholdDown sinking as it sank of old.(482)Or all its plains and cities drown,Breaking the wild sea barrier down;Crush the great deep impetuous will,Or bid the furious wind be still.He glorious in his high estateThe triple world could devastate,And there, supreme of men, could placeHis creatures of a new-born race.Never can mighty Ráma beO\\'ercome in fight, my King, by thee.Thy giant host the day might winFrom him, if heaven were gained by sin.If Gods were joined with demons, theyCould ne\\'er, I ween, that hero slay,But guile may kill the wondrous man;Attend while I disclose the plan.His wife, above all women graced,Is Sítá of the dainty waist,With limbs to fair proportion true,And a soft skin of lustrous hue,Round neck and arm rich gems are twined:She is the gem of womankind.With her no bright Gandharví vies,No nymph or Goddess in the skies;And none to rival her would dare\\'Mid dames who part the long black hair.That hero in the wood beguile,And steal his lovely spouse the while.Reft of his darling wife, be sure,Brief days the mourner will endure.\"With flattering hope of triumph movedThe giant king that plan approved,Pondered the counsel in his breast,And then Akampan thus addressed:\"Forth in my car I go at morn,None but the driver with me borne,And this fair Sítá will I bringBack to my city triumphing.\"Forth in his car by asses drawnThe giant monarch sped at dawn,Bright as the sun, the chariot castLight through the sky as on it passed.Then high in air that best of carsTraversed the path of lunar stars,Sending a fitful radiance paleAs moonbeams shot through cloudy veil.Far on his airy way he flew:Near Tádakeya(483) grove he drew.Márícha welcomed him, and placedBefore him food which giants taste,With honour led him to a seat,And brought him water for his feet;And then with timely words addressedSuch question to his royal guest:\"Speak, is it well with thee whose swayThe giant multitudes obey?I know not all, and ask in fearThe cause, O King, why thou art here.\"Ráva, the giants\\' mighty king,Heard wise Márícha questioning,And told with ready answer, taughtIn eloquence, the cause he sought:\"My guards, the bravest of my band,Are slain by Ráma vigorous hand,And Janasthán, that feared no hateOf foes, is rendered desolate.Come, aid me in the plan I layTo steal the conqueror wife away.\"Márícha heard the king request,And thus the giant chief addressed:\"What foe in friendly guise is heWho spoke of Sítá name to thee?Who is the wretch whose thought would bringDestruction on the giants\\' king?Whose is the evil counsel, say,That bids thee bear his wife away,And careless of thy life provokeEarth loftiest with threatening stroke?A foe is he who dared suggestThis hopeless folly to thy breast,Whose ill advice would bid thee drawThe venomed fang from serpent jaw.By whose unwise suggestion ledWilt thou the path of ruin tread?Whence falls the blow that would destroyThy gentle sleep of ease and joy?Like some wild elephant is heThat rears his trunk on high,Lord of an ancient pedigree,Huge tusks, and furious eye.Rávan, no rover of the nightWith bravest heart can brook,Met in the front of deadly fight,On Raghu son to look.The giant hosts were brave and strong,Good at the bow and spear:But Ráma slew the routed throng,A lion \\'mid the deer.No lion tooth can match his sword,Or arrows fiercely shot:He sleeps, he sleeps--the lion lord;Be wise and rouse him not.O Monarch of the giants, wellUpon my counsel think,Lest thou for ever in the hellOf Ráma vengeance sink:A hell, where deadly shafts are sentFrom his tremendous-bow,While his great arms all flight prevent,Like deepest mire below:Where the wild floods of battle raveAbove the foeman head,And each with many a feathery waveOf shafts is garlanded.O, quench the flames that in thy breastWith raging fury burn;And pacified and self-possessedTo Lanká town return.Rest thou in her imperial bowersWith thine own wives content,And in the wood let Ráma hoursWith Sítá still be spent.\"The lord of Lanká isle obeyedThe counsel, and his purpose stayed.Borne on his car he parted thenceAnd gained his royal residence.Canto XXXII. Rávan Roused.But Súrpanakhá saw the plainSpread with the fourteen thousand slain,Doers of cruel deeds o\\'erthrownBy Ráma mighty arm alone,Add Trisirás and Dúshan dead,And Khara, with the hosts they led.Their death she saw, and mad with pain,Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,And fled in anger and dismayTo Lanká, seat of Rávan sway.There on a throne of royal stateExalted sat the potentate,Begirt with counsellor and peer,Like Indra with the Storm Gods near.Bright as the sun full splendour shoneThe glorious throne he sat upon,As when the blazing fire is redUpon a golden altar fed.Wide gaped his mouth at every breath,Tremendous as the jaws of Death.With him high saints of lofty thought,Gandharvas, Gods, had vainly fought.The wounds were on his body yetFrom wars where Gods and demons met.And scars still marked his ample chestBy fierce Airávat(484) tusk impressed.A score of arms, ten necks, had he,His royal gear was brave to see.His massive form displayed each signThat marks the heir of kingly line.In stature like a mountain height,His arms were strong, his teeth were white,And all his frame of massive mouldSeemed lazulite adorned with gold.A hundred seams impressed each limpWhere Vishnu arm had wounded him,And chest and shoulder bore the printOf sword and spear and arrow dint,Where every God had struck a blowIn battle with the giant foe.His might to wildest rage could wakeThe sea whose faith naught else can shake,Hurl towering mountains to the earth,And crush e\\'en foes of heavenly birth.The bonds of law and right he spurned:To others\\' wives his fancy turned.Celestial arms he used in fight,And loved to mar each holy rite.He went to Bhogavatí town,(485)Where Vásuki was beaten down,And stole, victorious in the strife,Lord Takshaka beloved wife.Kailása lofty crest he sought,And when in vain Kuvera fought,Stole Pushpak thence, the car that throughThe air, as willed the master, flew.Impelled by furious anger, heSpoiled Nandan(486) shade and Naliní,And Chaitraratha heavenly grove,The haunts where Gods delight to rove.Tall as a hill that cleaves the sky,He raised his mighty arms on highTo check the blessed moon, and stayThe rising of the Lord of Day.Ten thousand years the giant spentOn dire austerities intent,And of his heads an offering, laidBefore the Self-existent, made.No God or fiend his life could take,Gandharva, goblin, bird, or snake:Safe from all fears of death, exceptFrom human arm, that life was kept.Oft when the priests began to raiseTheir consecrating hymns of praise,He spoiled the Soma sacred juicePoured forth by them in solemn use.The sacrifice his hands o\\'erthrew,And cruelly the Bráhmans slew.His was a heart that naught could melt,Joying in woes which others felt.She saw the ruthless monster there,Dread of the worlds, unused to spare.In robes of heavenly texture dressed,Celestial wreaths adorned his breast.He sat a shape of terror, likeDestruction ere the worlds it strike.She saw him in his pride of place,The joy of old Pulastya(487) race,Begirt by counsellor and peer,Rávan, the foeman mortal fear,And terror in her features shown,The giantess approached the throne.Then Súrpanakhá bearing yetEach deeply printed traceWhere the great-hearted chief had setA mark upon her face,Impelled by terror and desire,Still fierce, no longer bold,To Rávan of the eyes of fireHer tale, infuriate, told.Canto XXXIII. Súrpanakhá Speech.Burning with anger, in the ringOf counsellors who girt their king,To Rávan, ravener of man,With bitter words she thus began:\"Wilt thou absorbed in pleasure, stillPursue unchecked thy selfish will:Nor turn thy heedless eyes to seeThe coming fate which threatens thee?The king who days and hours employsIn base pursuit of vulgar joysMust in his people sight be vileAs fire that smokes on funeral pile.He who when duty calls him sparesNo time for thought of royal cares,Must with his realm and people allInvolved in fatal ruin fall.As elephants in terror shrinkFrom the false river miry brink,Thus subjects from a monarch fleeWhose face their eyes may seldom see,Who spends the hours for toil ordainedIn evil courses unrestrained.He who neglects to guard and holdHis kingdom by himself controlled,Sinks nameless like a hill whose headIs buried in the ocean bed.Thy foes are calm and strong and wise,Fiends, Gods, and warriors of the skies,--How, heedless, wicked, weak, and vain,Wilt thou thy kingly state maintain?Thou, lord of giants, void of sense,Slave of each changing influence,Heedless of all that makes a king,Destruction on thy head wilt bring.O conquering chief, the prince, who boasts,Of treasury and rule and hosts,By others led, though lord of all,Is meaner than the lowest thrall.For this are monarchs said to beLong-sighted, having power to seeThings far away by faithful eyesOf messengers and loyal spies.But aid from such thou wilt not seek:Thy counsellors are blind and weak,Or thou from these hadst surely knownThy legions and thy realm o\\'erthrown.Know, twice seven thousand, fierce in might,Are slain by Ráma in the fight,And they, the giant host who led,Khara and Dúshan, both are dead.Know, Ráma with his conquering armHas freed the saints from dread of harm,Has smitten Janasthán and madeAsylum safe in Dandak shade.Enslaved and dull, of blinded sight,Intoxicate with vain delight,Thou closest still thy heedless eyesTo dangers in thy realm that rise.A king besotted, mean, unkind,Of niggard hand and slavish mind.Will find no faithful followers heedTheir master in his hour of need.The friend on whom he most relies,In danger, from a monarch flies,Imperious in his high estate,Conceited, proud, and passionate;Who ne\\'er to state affairs attendsWith wholesome fear when woe impendsMost weak and worthless as the grass,Soon from his sway the realm will pass.For rotting wood a use is found,For clods and dust that strew the ground,But when a king has lost his sway,Useless he falls, and sinks for aye.As raiment by another worn,As faded garland crushed and torn,So is, unthroned, the proudest king,Though mighty once, a useless thing.But he who every sense subduesAnd each event observant views,Rewards the good and keeps from wrong,Shall reign secure and flourish long.Though lulled in sleep his senses lieHe watches with a ruler eye,Untouched by favour, ire, and hate,And him the people celebrate.O weak of mind, without a traceOf virtues that a king should grace,Who hast not learnt from watchful spyThat low in death the giants lie.Scorner of others, but enchainedBy every base desire,By thee each duty is disdainedWhich time and place require.Soon wilt thou, if thou canst not learn,Ere yet it be too late,The good from evil to discern,Fall from thy high estate.\"As thus she ceased not to upbraidThe king with cutting speech,And every fault to view displayed,Naming and marking each,The monarch of the sons of night,Of wealth and power possessed,And proud of his imperial might,Long pondered in his breast.Canto XXXIV. Súrpanakhá Speech.Then forth the giant fury brokeAs Súrpanakhá harshly spoke.Girt by his lords the demon kingLooked on her, fiercely questioning:\"Who is this Ráma, whence, and where?His form, his might, his deeds declare.His wandering steps what purpose ledTo Dandak forest, hard to tread?What arms are his that he could smiteIn fray the rovers of the night,And Trisirás and Dúshan layLow on the earth, and Khara slay?Tell all, my sister, and declareWho maimed thee thus, of form most fair.\"Thus by the giant king addressed,While burnt her fury unrepressed,The giantess declared at lengthThe hero form and deeds and strength:\"Long are his arms and large his eyes:A black deer skin his dress supplies.King Dasaratha son is he,Fair as Kandarpa self to see.Adorned with many a golden band,A bow, like Indra, arms his hand,And shoots a flood of arrows fierceAs venomed snakes to burn and pierce.I looked, I looked, but never sawHis mighty hand the bowstring drawThat sent the deadly arrows out,While rang through air his battle-shout.I looked, I looked, and saw too wellHow with that hail the giants fell,As falls to earth the golden grain,Struck by the blows of Indra rain.He fought, and twice seven thousand, allTerrific giants, strong and tall,Fell by the pointed shafts o\\'erthrownWhich Ráma shot on foot, alone.Three little hours had scarcely fled,--Khara and Dúshan both were dead,And he had freed the saints and madeAsylum sure in Dandak shade.Me of his grace the victor spared,Or I the giants\\' fate had shared.The high-souled Ráma would not deignHis hand with woman blood to stain.The glorious Lakshman, justly dear,In gifts and warrior might his peer,Serves his great brother with the wholeDevotion of his faithful soul:Impetuous victor, bold and wise,First in each hardy enterprise,Still ready by his side to stand,A second self or better hand.And Ráma has a large-eyed spouse,Pure as the moon her cheek and brows,Dearer than life in Ráma sight,Whose happiness is her delight.With beauteous hair and nose the dameFrom head to foot has naught to blame.She shines the wood bright Goddess, QueenOf beauty with her noble mien.First in the ranks of women placedIs Sítá of the dainty waist.In all the earth mine eyes have ne\\'erSeen female form so sweetly fair.Goddess nor nymph can vie with her,Nor bride of heavenly chorister.He who might call this dame his own,Her eager arms about him thrown,Would live more blest in Sítá loveThan Indra in the world above.She, peerless in her form and faceAnd rich in every gentle grace,Is worthy bride, O King, for thee,As thou art meet her lord to be.I even I, will bring the brideIn triumph to her lover side--This beauty fairer than the rest,With rounded limb and heaving breast.Each wound upon my face I oweTo cruel Lakshman savage blow.But thou, O brother, shalt surveyHer moonlike loveliness to-day,And Káma piercing shafts shall smiteThine amorous bosom at the sight.If in thy breast the longing riseTo make thine own the beauteous prize,Up, let thy better foot beginThe journey and the treasure win.If, giant Lord, thy favouring eyesRegard the plan which I advise,Up, cast all fear and doubt awayAnd execute the words I sayCome, giant King, this treasure seek,For thou art strong and they are weak.Let Sítá of the faultless frameBe borne away and be thy dame.Thy host in Janasthán who dweltForth to the battle hied.And by the shafts which Ráma dealtThey perished in their pride.Dúshan and Khara breathe no more,Laid low upon the plain.Arise, and ere the day be o\\'erTake vengeance for the slain.\"Canto XXXV. Rávan Journey.When Rávan, by her fury spurred,That terrible advice had heard,He bade his nobles quit his side,And to the work his thought applied.He turned his anxious mind to scanOn every side the hardy plan:The gain against the risk he laid,Each hope and fear with care surveyed,And in his heart at length decreedTo try performance of the deed.Then steady in his dire intentThe giant to the courtyard went.There to his charioteer he cried,\"Bring forth the car whereon I ride.\"Aye ready at his master wordThe charioteer the order heard,And yoked with active zeal the bestOf chariots at his lord behest.Asses with heads of goblins drewThat wondrous car where\\'er it flew.Obedient to the will it rolledAdorned with gems and glistering gold.Then mounting, with a roar as loudAs thunder from a labouring cloud,The mighty monarch to the tideOf Ocean, lord of rivers, hied.White was the shade above him spread,White chouris waved around his head,And he with gold and jewels brightShone like the glossy lazulite.Ten necks and twenty arms had he:His royal gear was good to see.The heavenly Gods\\' insatiate foe,Who made the blood of hermits flow,He like the Lord of Hills appearedWith ten huge heads to heaven upreared.In the great car whereon he rode,Like some dark cloud the giant showed,When round it in their close arrayThe cranes \\'mid wreaths of lightning play.He looked, and saw, from realms of air,The rocky shore of ocean, whereUnnumbered trees delightful grewWith flower and fruit of every hue.He looked on many a lilied poolWith silvery waters fresh and cool,And shores like spacious altars meetFor holy hermits\\' lone retreat.The graceful palm adorned the scene,The plantain waved her glossy green.There grew the sál and betel, thereOn bending boughs the flowers were fair.There hermits dwelt who tamed each senseBy strictest rule of abstinence:Gandharvas, Kinnars,(488) thronged the place,Nágas and birds of heavenly race.Bright minstrels of the ethereal quire,And saints exempt from low desire,With Ájas, sons of Brahmá line,Maríchipas of seed divine,Vaikhánasas and Máshas strayed,And Bálakhilyas(489) in the shade.The lovely nymphs of heaven were there,Celestial wreaths confined their hair,And to each form new grace was lentBy wealth of heavenly ornament.Well skilled was each in play and danceAnd gentle arts of dalliance.The glorious wife of many a GodThose beautiful recesses trod,There Gods and Dánavs, all who eatThe food of heaven, rejoiced to meet.The swan and Sáras thronged each bayWith curlews, ducks, and divers gay,Where the sea spray rose soft and whiteO\\'er rocks of glossy lazulite.As his swift way the fiend pursuedPale chariots of the Gods he viewed,Bearing each lord whose rites austereHad raised him to the heavenly sphere.Thereon celestial garlands hung,There music played and songs were sung.Then bright Gandharvas met his view,And heavenly nymphs, as on he flew.He saw the sandal woods below,And precious trees of odorous flow,That to the air around them lentTheir riches of delightful scent;Nor failed his roving eye to markTall aloe trees in grove and park.He looked on wood with cassias filled,And plants which balmy sweets distilled,Where her fair flowers the betel showedAnd the bright pods of pepper glowed.The pearls in many a silvery heapLay on the margin of the deep.And grey rocks rose amid the redOf coral washed from ocean bed.High soared the mountain peaks that boreTreasures of gold and silver ore,And leaping down the rocky wallsCame wild and glorious waterfalls.Fair towns which grain and treasure held,And dames who every gem excelled,He saw outspread beneath him far,With steed, and elephant, and car.That ocean shore he viewed that showedFair as the blessed Gods\\' abodeWhere cool delightful breezes playedO\\'er levels in the freshest shade.He saw a fig-tree like a cloudWith mighty branches earthward bowed.It stretched a hundred leagues and madeFor hermit bands a welcome shade.Thither the feathered king of yoreAn elephant and tortoise bore,And lighted on a bough to eatThe captives of his taloned feet.The bough unable to sustainThe crushing weight and sudden strain,Loaded with sprays and leaves of springGave way beneath the feathered king.Under the shadow of the treeDwelt many a saint and devotee,Ájas, the sons of Brahmá line,Máshas, Maríchipas divine.Vaikhánasas, and all the raceOf Bálakhilyas, loved the place.But pitying their sad estateThe feathered monarch raised the weightOf the huge bough, and bore awayThe loosened load and captured prey.A hundred leagues away he sped,Then on his monstrous booty fed,And with the bough he smote the landsWhere dwell the wild Nisháda bands.High joy was his because his deedFrom jeopardy the hermits freed.That pride for great deliverance wroughtA double share of valour brought.His soul conceived the high empriseTo snatch the Amrit from the skies.He rent the nets of iron first,Then through the jewel chamber burst,And bore the drink of heaven awayThat watched in Indra palace lay.Such was the hermit-sheltering treeWhich Rávan turned his eye to see.Still marked where Garud sought to rest,The fig-tree bore the name of Blest.When Rávan stayed his chariot o\\'erThe ocean heart-enchanting shore,He saw a hermitage that stoodSequestered in the holy wood.He saw the fiend Márícha thereWith deerskin garb, and matted hairCoiled up in hermit guise, who spentHis days by rule most abstinent.As guest and host are wont to meet,They met within that lone retreat.Before the king Márícha placedFood never known to human taste.He entertained his guest with meatAnd gave him water for his feet,And then addressed the giant kingWith timely words of questioning:\"Lord, is it well with thee, and wellWith those in Lanká town who dwell?What sudden thought, what urgent needHas brought thee with impetuous speed?\"The fiend Márícha thus addressedRávan the king, his mighty guest,And he, well skilled in arts that guideThe eloquent, in turn replied:Canto XXXVI. Rávan Speech.\"Hear me, Márícha, while I speak,And tell thee why thy home I seek.Sick and distressed am I, and seeMy surest hope and help in thee.Of Janasthán I need not tell,Where Súrpanakhá, Khara, dwell,And Dúshan with the arm of might,And Trisirás, the fierce in fight,Who feeds on human flesh and gore,And many noble giants more,Who roam in dark of midnight throughThe forest, brave and strong and true.By my command they live at easeAnd slaughter saints and devotees.Those twice seven thousand giants, allObedient to their captain call,Joying in war and ruthless deedsFollow where mighty Khara leads.Those fearless warrior bands who roamThrough Janasthán their forest home,In all their terrible arrayMet Ráma in the battle fray.Girt with all weapons forth they spedWith Khara at the army head.The front of battle Ráma held:With furious wrath his bosom swelled.Without a word his hate to showHe launched the arrows from his bow.On the fierce hosts the missiles came,Each burning with destructive flame,The twice seven thousand fell o\\'erthrownBy him, a man, on foot, alone.Khara the army chief and pride,And Dúshan, fearless warrior, died,And Trisirás the fierce was slain,And Dandak wood was free again.He, banished by his angry sire,Roams with his wife in mean attire.This wretch, his Warrior tribe disgraceHas slain the best of giant race.Harsh, wicked, fierce and greedy-souled,A fool, with senses uncontrolled,No thought of duty stirs his breast:He joys to see the world distressed.He sought the wood with fair pretenceOf truthful life and innocence,But his false hand my sister leftMangled, of nose and ears bereft.This Ráma wife who bears the nameOf Sítá, in her face and frameFair as a daughter of the skies,--Her will I seize and bring the prizeTriumphant from the forest shade:For this I seek thy willing aid.If thou, O mighty one, wilt lendThy help and stand beside thy friend,I with my brothers may defyAll Gods embattled in the sky.Come, aid me now, for thine the powerTo succour in the doubtful hour.Thou art in war and time of fear,For heart and hand, without a peer.For thou art skilled in art and wile,A warrior brave and trained in guile.With this one hope, this only aim,O Rover of the Night, I came.Now let me tell what aid I askTo back me in my purposed task.In semblance of a golden deerAdorned with silver spots appear.Go, seek his dwelling: in the wayOf Ráma and his consort stray.Doubt not the lady, when she seesThe wondrous deer amid the trees,Will bid her lord and Lakshman takeThe creature for its beauty sake.Then when the chiefs have parted thence,And left her lone, without defence,As Ráhu storms the moonlight, IWill seize the lovely dame and fly.Her lord will waste away and weepFor her his valour could not keep.Then boldly will I strike the blowAnd wreak my vengeance on the foe.\"When wise Márícha heard the taleHis heart grew faint, his cheek was pale,He stared with open orbs, and triedTo moisten lips which terror dried,And grief, like death, his bosom rentAs on the king his look he bent.The monarch will he strove to stay,Distracted with alarm,For well he knew the might that layIn Ráma matchless arm.With suppliant hands Márícha stoodAnd thus began to tellHis counsel for the tyrant good,And for his own as well:Canto XXXVII. Márícha Speech.Márícha gave attentive earThe ruler of the fiends to hear:Then, trained in all the rules that teachThe eloquent, began his speech:\"\\'Tis easy task, O King, to findSmooth speakers who delight the mind.But they who urge and they who doDistasteful things and wise, are few.Thou hast not learnt, by proof untaught,And borne away by eager thought,That Ráma, formed for high emprise,With Varun or with Indra vies.Still let thy people live in peace,Nor let their name and lineage cease,For Ráma with his vengeful handCan sweep the giants from the land.O, let not Janak daughter bringDestruction on the giant king.Let not the lady Sítá wakeA tempest, on thy head to break.Still let the dame, by care untried,Be happy by her husband side,Lest swift avenging ruin fallOn glorious Lanká, thee, and all.Men such as thou with wills unchained,Advised by sin and unrestrained,Destroy themselves, the king, the state,And leave the people desolate.Ráma, in bonds of duty held,Was never by his sire expelled.He is no wretch of greedy mind,Dishonour of his Warrior kind.Free from all touch of rancorous spite,All creatures\\' good is his delight.He saw his sire of truthful heartDeceived by Queen Kaikeyí art,And said, a true and duteous son,\"What thou hast promised shall be done.\"To gratify the lady will,His father promise to fulfil,He left his realm and all delightFor Dandak wood, an anchorite.No cruel wretch, no senseless foolIs Ráma, unrestrained by rule.This groundless charge has ne\\'er been heard,Nor shouldst thou speak the slanderous word.Ráma in truth and goodness boldIs Virtue self in human mould,The sovereign of the world confessedAs Indra rules among the Blest.And dost thou plot from him to rendThe darling whom his arms defend?Less vain the hope to steal awayThe glory of the Lord of Day.O Rávan, guard thee from the fireOf vengeful Ráma kindled ire,--Each spark a shaft with deadly aim,While bow and falchion feed the flame.Cast not away in hopeless strifeThy realm, thy bliss, thine own dear life.O Rávan of his might beware,A God of Death who will not spare.That bow he knows so well to drawIs the destroyer flaming jaw,And with his shafts which flash and glowHe slays the armies of the foe.Thou ne\\'er canst win--the thought forego--From the safe guard of shaft and bowKing Janak child, the dear delightOf Ráma unapproached in might.The spouse of Raghu son, confessedLion of men with lion chest,--Dearer than life, through good and illDevoted to her husband will,The slender-waisted, still must beFrom thy polluting touches free.Far better grasp with venturous handThe flame to wildest fury fanned.What, King of giants, canst thou gainFrom this attempt so wild and vain?If in the fight his eye he bendUpon thee, Lord, thy days must end,So life and bliss and royal sway,Lost beyond hope, will pass away.Summon each lord of high estate,And chief, Vibhishan(490) to debate.With peers in lore of counsel triedConsider, reason, and decideScan strength and weakness, count the cost,What may be gained and what be lost.Examine and compare arightThy proper power and Ráma might,Then if thy weal be still thy care,Thou wilt be prudent and forbear.O giant King, the contest shun,Thy force is all too weakThe lord of Kosál mighty sonIn deadly fray to seek.King of the hosts that rove at night,O hear what I advise:My prudent counsel do not slight;Be patient and be wise.\"Canto XXXVIII. Márícha Speech.\"Once in my strength and vigour prideI roamed this earth from side to side,And towering like a mountain crest,A thousand Nágas\\'(491) might possessed.Like some vast sable cloud I showed:My golden armlets flashed and glowed.A crown I wore, an axe I swayed,And all I met were sore afraid.I roved where Dandak wood is spread;On flesh of slaughtered saints I fed.Then Visvámitra, sage revered,Holy of heart, my fury feared.To Dasaratha court he spedAnd went before the king and said:(492)\"With me, my lord, thy Ráma sendOn holy days his aid to lend.Márícha fills my soul with dreadAnd keeps me sore disquieted.\"The monarch heard the saint requestAnd thus the glorious sage addressed:\"My boy as yet in arms untrainedThe age of twelve has scarce attained.But I myself a host will leadTo guard thee in the hour of need.My host with fourfold troops complete,The rover of the night shall meet,And I, O best of saints, will killThy foeman and thy prayer fulfil.\"The king vouchsafed his willing aid:The saint again this answer made:\"By Ráma might, and his alone,Can this great fiend be overthrown.I know in days of yore the BlestThy saving help in fight confessed.Still of thy famous deeds they tellIn heaven above, in earth, and hell,A mighty host obeys thy hest:Here let it still, I pray thee, rest.Thy glorious son, though yet a boy,Will in the fight that fiend destroy.Ráma alone with me shall go:Be happy, victor of the foe.\"He spoke: the monarch gave assent,And Ráma to the hermit lent.So to his woodland home in joyWent Visvámitra with the boy.With ready bow the champion stoodTo guard the rites in Dandak wood.With glorious eyes, most bright to view,Beardless as yet and dark of hue;A single robe his only wear,His temples veiled with waving hair,Around his neck a chain of gold,He grasped the bow he loved to hold;And the young hero presence madeA glory in the forest shade.Thus Ráma with his beauteous mien,Like the young rising moon was seen,I, like a cloud which tempest brings,My arms adorned with golden rings,Proud of the boon which lent me might,Approached where dwelt the anchorite.But Ráma saw me venturing nigh,Raising my murderous axe on high;He saw, and fearless of the foe,Strung with calm hand his trusty bow.By pride of conscious strength beguiled,I scorned him as a feeble child,And rushed with an impetuous boundOn Visvámitra holy ground.A keen swift shaft he pointed well,The foeman rage to check and quell,And hurled a hundred leagues awayDeep in the ocean waves I lay.He would not kill, but, nobly brave,My forfeit life he chose to save.So there I lay with wandering senseDazed by that arrow violence.Long in the sea I lay: at lengthSlowly returned my sense and strength,And rising from my watery bedTo Lanká town again I sped.Thus was I spared, but all my bandFell slain by Ráma conquering hand,--A boy, untrained in warrior skill,Of iron arm and dauntless will.If thou with Ráma still, in spiteOf warning and of prayer, wilt fight,I see terrific woes impend,And dire defeat thy days will end.Thy giants all will feel the blowAnd share the fatal overthrow,Who love the taste of joy and play,The banquet and the festal day.Thine eyes will see destruction takeThy Lanká, lost for Sítá sake,And stately pile and palace fallWith terrace, dome, and jewelled wall.The good will die: the crime of kingsDestruction on the people brings:The sinless die, as in the lakeThe fish must perish with the snake.The prostrate giants thou wilt seeSlain for this folly wrought by thee,Their bodies bright with precious scentAnd sheen of heavenly ornament;Or see the remnant of thy trainSeek refuge far, when help is vainAnd with their wives, or widowed, flyTo every quarter of the sky;Thy mournful eyes, where\\'er they turn,Will see thy stately city burn,When royal homes with fire are red,And arrowy nets around are spread.A sin that tops all sins in shameIs outrage to another dame,A thousand wives thy palace fill,And countless beauties wait thy will.O rest contented with thine own,Nor let thy race be overthrown.If thou, O King, hast still delightIn rank and wealth and power and might,In noble wives, in troops of friends,In all that royal state attends,I warn thee, cast not all away,Nor challenge Ráma to the fray.If deaf to every friendly prayer,Thou still wilt seek the strife,And from the side of Ráma tearHis lovely Maithil wife,Soon will thy life and empire endDestroyed by Ráma bow,And thou, with kith and kin and friend,To Yáma realm must go.\"Canto XXXIX. Márícha Speech.\"I told thee of that dreadful dayWhen Ráma smote and spared to slay.Now hear me, Rávan, while I tellWhat in the after time befell.At length, restored to strength and pride,I and two mighty fiends besideAssumed the forms of deer and strayedThrough Dandak wood in lawn and glade,I reared terrific horns: beneathWere flaming tongue and pointed teeth.I roamed where\\'er my fancy led,And on the flesh of hermits fed,In sacred haunt, by hallowed tree,Where\\'er the ritual fires might be.A fearful shape, I wandered throughThe wood, and many a hermit slew.With ruthless rage the saints I killedWho in the grove their tasks fulfilled.When smitten to the earth they sank,Their flesh I ate, their blood I drank,And with my cruel deeds dismayedAll dwellers in the forest shade,Spoiling their rites in bitter hate,With human blood inebriate.Once in the wood I chanced to seeRáma again, a devotee,A hermit, fed on scanty fare,Who made the good of all his care.His noble wife was by his side,And Lakshman in the battle tried.In senseless pride I scorned the mightOf that illustrious anchorite,And heedless of a hermit foe,Recalled my earlier overthrow.I charged him in my rage and scornTo slay him with my pointed horn,In heedless haste, to fury wroughtAs on my former wounds I thought.Then from the mighty bow he drewThree foe-destroying arrows flew,Keen-pointed, leaping from the string,Swift as the wind or feathered king.Dire shafts, on flesh of foemen fed,Like rushing thunderbolts they sped,With knots well smoothed and barbs well bent,Shot e\\'en as one, the arrows went.But I who Ráma might had felt,And knew the blows the hero dealt,Escaped by rapid flight. The twoWho lingered on the spot, he slew.I fled from mortal danger, freedFrom the dire shaft by timely speed.Now to deep thought my days I give,And as a humble hermit live.In every shrub, in every treeI view that noblest devotee.In every knotted trunk I markHis deerskin and his coat of bark,And see the bow-armed Ráma standLike Yáma with his noose in hand.I tell thee Rávan, in my frightA thousand Rámas mock my sight,This wood with every bush and boughSeems all one fearful Ráma now.Throughout the grove there is no spotSo lonely where I see him not.He haunts me in my dreams by night,And wakes me with the wild affright.The letter that begins his nameSends terror through my startled frame.The rapid cars whereon we ride,The rich rare jewels, once my pride,Have names(493) that strike upon mine earWith hated sound that counsels fear.His mighty strength too well I know,Nor art thou match for such a foe.Too strong were Raghus son in fightFor Namuchi or Bali might.Then Ráma to the battle dare,Or else be patient and forbear;But, wouldst thou see me live in peace,Let mention of the hero cease.The good whose holy lives were spentIn deepest thought, most innocent,With all their people many a timeHave perished through another crime.So in the common ruin, IMust for another folly die,Do all thy strength and courage can,But ne\\'er will I approve the plan.For he, in might supremely great,The giant world could extirpate,Since, when impetuous Khara soughtThe grove of Janasthán and foughtFor Súrpanakhá sake, he diedBy Ráma hand in battle tried.How has he wronged thee? Soothly swear,And Ráma fault and sin declare.I warn thee, and my words are wise,I seek thy people weal:But if this rede thou wilt despise,Nor hear my last appeal,Thou with thy kin and all thy friendsIn fight this day wilt die,When his great bow the hero bends,And shafts unerring fly.\"Canto XL. Rávan Speech.But Rávan scorned the rede he gaveIn timely words to warn and save,E\\'en as the wretch who hates to liveRejects the herb the leeches give.By fate to sin and ruin spurred,That sage advice the giant heard,Then in reproaches hard and sternThus to Márícha spoke in turn:\"Is this thy counsel, weak and base,Unworthy of thy giant race?Thy speech is fruitless, vain, thy toilLike casting seed on barren soil.No words of thine shall drive me backFrom Ráma and the swift attack.A fool is he, inured to sin,And more, of human origin.The craven, at a woman callTo leave his sire, his mother, allThe friends he loved, the power and sway,And hasten to the woods away!But now his anger will I rouse,Stealing away his darling spouse.I in thy sight will ravish herFrom Khara cruel murderer.Upon this plan my soul is bent,And naught shall move my firm intent,Not if the way through demons ledAnd Gods with Indra at their head.\\'Tis thine, when questioned, to explainThe hope and fear, the loss and gain,And, when thy king thy thoughts would know,The triumph or the danger show.A prudent counsellor should wait,And speak when ordered in debate,With hands uplifted, calm and meek,If honour and reward he seek.Or, when some prudent course he seesWhich, spoken, may his king displeaseHe should by hints of dexterous artHis counsel to his lord impart.But prudent words are said in vainWhen the blunt speech brings grief and pain.A high-souled king will scarcely thankThe man who shames his royal rank.Five are the shapes that kings assume,Of majesty, of grace, and gloom:Like Indra now, or Agni, nowLike the dear Moon, with placid brow:Like mighty Varun now they show,Now fierce as He who rules below.O giant, monarchs lofty-souledAre kind and gentle, stern and bold,With gracious love their gifts dispenseAnd swiftly punish each offence.Thus subjects should their rulers viewWith all respect and honour due.But folly leads thy heart to slightThy monarch and neglect his right.Thou hast in lawless pride addressedWith bitter words thy royal guest.I asked thee not my strength to scan,Or loss and profit in the plan.I only spoke to tell the deedO mighty one, by me decreed,And bid thee in the peril lendThy succour to support thy friend.Hear me again, and I will tellHow thou canst aid my venture well.In semblance of a golden deerAdorned with silver drops, appear:And near the cottage in the wayOf Ráma and his consort stray.Draw nigh, and wandering through the brakeWith thy strange form her fancy take.The Maithil dame with wondering eyesWill took upon thy fair disguise,And quickly bid her husband goAnd bring the deer that charms her so,When Raghu son has left the place,Still pressing onward in the chase,Cry out, \"O Lakshman! Ah, mine own!\"With voice resembling Ráma tone.When Lakshman hears his brother cry,Impelled by Sítá he will fly,Restless with eager love, to aidThe hunter in the distant shade.When both her guards have left her side,Even as Indra, thousand-eyed,Clasps Sachí, will I bear awayThe Maithil dame an easy prey.When thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,Go where thou wilt and live content.True servant, faithful to thy vow,With half my realm I thee endow.Go forth, may luck thy way attendThat leads thee to the happy end.I in my car will quickly beIn Dandak wood, and follow thee.So will I cheat this Ráma eyesAnd win without a blow the prize;And safe return to Lanká townWith thee, my friend, this day shall crown.But if thou wilt not aid my will,My hand this day thy blood shall spill.Yea, thou must share the destined task,For force will take the help I ask.No bliss that rebel life attendsWhose stubborn will his lord offends.Thy life, if thou the task assay,In jeopardy may stand;Oppose me, and this very dayThou diest by this hand.Now ponder all that thou hast heardWithin thy prudent breast:Reflect with care on every word,And do what seems the best.\"Canto XLI. Márícha Reply.Against his judgment sorely pressedBy his imperious lord behest,Márícha threats of death defiedAnd thus with bitter words replied:\"Ah, who, my King, with sinful thoughtThis wild and wicked counsel taught,By which destruction soon will fallOn thee, thy sons, thy realm and all?Who is the guilty wretch who seesWith envious eye thy blissful ease,And by this plan, so falsely shown,Death gate for thee has open thrown?With souls impelled by mean desireThy foes against thy life conspire.They urge thee to destruction brink,And gladly would they see thee sink.Who with base thought to work thee woeThis fatal road has dared to show,And, triumph in his wicked eye,Would see thee enter in and die?To all thy counsellors, untrue,The punishment of death is due,Who see thee tempt the dangerous way,Nor strain each nerve thy foot to stay.Wise lords, whose king, by passion led,The path of sin begins to tread,Restrain him while there yet is time:But thine,--they see nor heed the crime.These by their master will obtainMerit and fame and joy and gain.\\'Tis only by their master graceThat servants hold their lofty place.But when the monarch stoops to sinThey lose each joy they strive to win,And all the people people high and lowFall in the common overthrow.Merit and fame and honour spring,Best of the mighty, from the king.So all should strive with heart and willTo keep the king from every ill.Pride, violence, and sullen hateWill ne\\'er maintain a monarch state,And those who cruel deeds adviseMust perish when their master dies,Like drivers with their cars o\\'erthrownIn places rough with root and stone.The good whose holy lives were spentOn duty highest laws intent,With wives and children many a timeHave perished for another crime.Hapless are they whose sovereign lord,Opposed to all, by all abhorred,Is cruel-hearted, harsh, severe:Thus might a jackal tend the deer.Now all the giant race await,Destroyed by thee, a speedy fate,Ruled by a king so cruel-souled,Foolish in heart and uncontrolled.Think not I fear the sudden blowThat threatens now to lay me low:I mourn the ruin that I seeImpending o\\'er thy host and thee.Me first perchance will Ráma kill,But soon his hand thy blood will spill.I die, and if by Ráma slainAnd not by thee, I count it gain.Soon as the hero face I seeHis angry eyes will murder me,And if on her thy hands thou layThy friends and thou are dead this day.If with my help thou still must dareThe lady from her lord to tear,Farewell to all our days are o\\'er,Lanká and giants are no more.In vain, in vain, an earnest friend,I warn thee, King, and pray.Thou wilt not to my prayers attend,Or heed the words I saySo men, when life is fleeting fastAnd death sad hour is nigh,Heedless and blinded to the lastReject advice and die.\"Canto XLII. Márícha Transformed.Márícha thus in wild unrestWith bitter words the king addressed.Then to his giant lord in dread,\"Arise, and let us go,\" he said.\"Ah, I have met that mighty lordArmed with his shafts and bow and sword,And if again that bow he bendOur lives that very hour will end.For none that warrior can provokeAnd think to fly his deadly stroke.Like Yáma with his staff is he,And his dread hand will slaughter thee.What can I more? My words can findNo passage to thy stubborn mind.I go, great King, thy task to share,And may success attend thee there.\"With that reply and bold consentThe giant king was well content.He strained Márícha to his breastAnd thus with joyful words addressed:\"There spoke a hero dauntless still,Obedient to his master will,Márícha proper self once more:Some other took thy shape before.Come, mount my jewelled car that flies.Will-governed, through the yielding skies.These asses, goblin-faced, shall bearUs quickly through the fields of air.Attract the lady with thy shape,Then through the wood, at will, escape.And I, when she has no defence,Will seize the dame and bear her thence.\"Again Márícha made reply,Consent and will to signify.With rapid speed the giants twoFrom the calm hermit dwelling flew,Borne in that wondrous chariot, meetFor some great God celestial seat.They from their airy path looked downOn many a wood and many a town,On lake and river, brook and rill,City and realm and towering hill.Soon he whom giant hosts obeyed,Márícha by his side, surveyedThe dark expanse of Dandak woodWhere Ráma hermit cottage stood.They left the flying car, whereonThe wealth of gold and jewels shone,And thus the giant king addressedMárícha as his hand he pressed:\"Márícha, look! before our eyesRound Ráma home the plantains rise.His hermitage is now in view:Quick to the work we came to do!\"Thus Rávan spoke, Márícha heardObedient to his master word,Threw off his giant shape and nearThe cottage strayed a beauteous deer.With magic power, by rapid change,His borrowed form was fair and strange.A sapphire tipped each horn with light;His face was black relieved with white.The turkis and the ruby shedA glory from his ears and head.His arching neck was proudly raised,And lazulites beneath it blazed.With roseate bloom his flanks were dyed,And lotus tints adorned his hide.His shape was fair, compact, and slight;His hoofs were carven lazulite.His tail with every changing glowDisplayed the hues of Indra bow.With glossy skin so strangely flecked,With tints of every gem bedecked.A light o\\'er Ráma home he sent,And through the wood, where\\'er he went.The giant clad in that strange dressThat took the soul with loveliness,To charm the fair Videhan eyesWith mingled wealth of mineral dyes,Moved onward, cropping in his way,The grass and grain and tender spray.His coat with drops of silver bright,A form to gaze on with delight,He raised his fair neck as he wentTo browse on bud and filament.Now in the Cassia grove he strayed,Now by the cot in plantains\\' shade.Slowly and slowly on he cameTo catch the glances of the dame,And the tall deer of splendid hueShone full at length in Sítá view.He roamed where\\'er his fancy choseWhere Ráma leafy cottage rose.Now near, now far, in careless ease,He came and went among the trees.Now with light feet he turned to fly,Now, reassured, again drew nigh:Now gambolled close with leap and bound,Now lay upon the grassy ground:Now sought the door, devoid of fear,And mingled with the troop of deer;Led them a little way, and thenceAgain returned with confidence.Now flying far, now turning backEmboldened on his former track,Seeking to win the lady glanceHe wandered through the green expanse.Then thronging round, the woodland deerGazed on his form with wondering fear;A while they followed where he led,Then snuffed the tainted gale and fled.The giant, though he longed to slayThe startled quarry, spared the prey,And mindful of the shape he woreTo veil his nature, still forbore.Then Sítá of the glorious eye,Returning from her task drew nigh;For she had sought the wood to bringEach loveliest flower of early spring.Now would the bright-eyed lady chooseSome gorgeous bud with blending hues,Now plucked the mango spray, and nowThe bloom from an Asoka bough.She with her beauteous form, unmeetFor woodland life and lone retreat,That wondrous dappled deer beheldGemmed with rich pearls, unparalleled,His silver hair the lady saw,His radiant teeth and lips and jaw,And gazed with rapture as her eyesExpanded in their glad surprise.And when the false deer glances fellOn her whom Ráma loved so well,He wandered here and there, and castA luminous beauty as he passed;And Janak child with strange delightKept gazing on the unwonted sight.Canto XLIII. The Wondrous Deer.She stooped, her hands with flowers to fill,But gazed upon the marvel still:Gazed on its back and sparkling sideWhere silver hues with golden vied.Joyous was she of faultless mould,With glossy skin like polished gold.And loudly to her husband criedAnd bow-armed Lakshman by his side:Again, again she called in glee:\"O come this glorious creature see;Quick, quick, my lord, this deer to view.And bring thy brother Lakshman too.\"As through the wood her clear tones rang,Swift to her side the brothers sprang.With eager eyes the grove they scanned,And saw the deer before them stand.But doubt was strong in Lakshman breast,Who thus his thought and fear expressed:\"Stay, for the wondrous deer we seeThe fiend Márícha self may be.Ere now have kings who sought this placeTo take their pastime in the chase,Met from his wicked art defeat,And fallen slain by like deceit.He wears, well trained in magic guile,The figure of a deer a while,Bright as the very sun, or placeWhere dwell the gay Gandharva race.No deer, O Ráma, e\\'er was seenThus decked with gold and jewels\\' sheen.\\'Tis magic, for the world has ne\\'er,Lord of the world, shown aught so fair.\"But Sítá of the lovely smile,A captive to the giant wile,Turned Lakshman prudent speech asideAnd thus with eager words replied:\"My honoured lord, this deer I seeWith beauty rare enraptures me.Go, chief of mighty arm, and bringFor my delight this precious thing.Fair creatures of the woodland roamUntroubled near our hermit home.The forest cow and stag are there,The fawn, the monkey, and the bear,Where spotted deer delight to play,And strong and beauteous Kinnars(494) stray.But never, as they wandered by,Has such a beauty charmed mine eyeAs this with limbs so fair and slight,So gentle, beautiful and bright.O see, how fair it is to viewWith jewels of each varied hue:Bright as the rising moon it glows,Lighting the wood where\\'er it goes.Ah me, what form and grace are there!Its limbs how fine, its hues how fair!Transcending all that words express,It takes my soul with loveliness.O, if thou would, to please me, striveTo take the beauteous thing alive,How thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyesDelighted on the lovely prize!And when our woodland life is o\\'er,And we enjoy our realm once more,The wondrous animal will graceThe chambers of my dwelling-place,And a dear treasure will it beTo Bharat and the queens and me,And all with rapture and amazeUpon its heavenly form will gaze.But if the beauteous deer, pursued,Thine arts to take it still elude,Strike it, O chieftain, and the skinWill be a treasure, laid within.O, how I long my time to passSitting upon the tender grass,With that soft fell beneath me spreadBright with its hair of golden thread!This strong desire, this eager will,Befits a gentle lady ill:But when I first beheld, its lookMy breast with fascination took.See, golden hair its flank adorns,And sapphires tip its branching horns.Resplendent as the lunar way,Or the first blush of opening day,With graceful form and radiant hueIt charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.\"He heard her speech with willing ear,He looked again upon the deer.Its lovely shape his breast beguiledMoved by the prayer of Janak child,And yielding for her pleasure sake,To Lakshman Ráma turned and spake:\"Mark, Lakshman, mark how Sítá breastWith eager longing is possessed.To-day this deer of wondrous breedMust for his passing beauty bleed,Brighter than e\\'er in Nandan strayed,Or Chaitraratha heavenly shade.How should the groves of earth possessSuch all-surpassing loveliness!The hair lies smooth and bright and fine,Or waves upon each curving line,And drops of living gold bedeckThe beauty of his side and neck.O look, his crimson tongue betweenHis teeth like flaming fire is seen,Flashing, whene\\'er his lips he parts,As from a cloud the lightning darts.O see his sunlike forehead shineWith emerald tints and almandine,While pearly light and roseate glowOf shells adorn his neck below.No eye on such a deer can restBut soft enchantment takes the breast:No man so fair a thing beholdAblaze with light of radiant gold,Celestial, bright with jewels\\' sheen,Nor marvel when his eyes have seen.A king equipped with bow and shaftDelights in gentle forest craft,And as in boundless woods he straysThe quarry for the venison slays.There as he wanders with his trainA store of wealth he oft may gain.He claims by right the precious ore,He claims the jewels\\' sparkling store.Such gains are dearer in his eyesThan wealth that in his chamber lies,The dearest things his spirit knows,Dear as the bliss which Sukra chose.But oft the rich expected gainWhich heedless men pursue in vain,The sage, who prudent counsels know,Explain and in a moment show.This best of deer, this gem of all,To yield his precious spoils must fall,And tender Sítá by my sideShall sit upon the golden hide.Ne\\'er could I find so rich a coatOn spotted deer or sheep or goat.No buck or antelope has such,So bright to view, so soft to touch.This radiant deer and one on highThat moves in glory through the sky,Alike in heavenly beauty are,One on the earth and one a star.But, brother, if thy fears be true,And this bright creature that we viewBe fierce Márícha in disguise,Then by this hand he surely dies.For that dire fiend who spurns controlWith bloody hand and cruel soul,Has roamed this forest and dismayedThe holiest saints who haunt the shade.Great archers, sprung of royal race,Pursuing in the wood the chase,Have fallen by his wicked art,And now my shaft shall strike his heart.Vatápi, by his magic powerMade heedless saints his flesh devour,Then, from within their frames he rentForth bursting from imprisonment.But once his art in senseless prideUpon the mightiest saint he tried,Agastya self, and caused him tasteThe baited meal before him placed.Vátápi, when the rite was o\\'er,Would take the giant form he wore,But Saint Agastya knew his wileAnd checked the giant with smile.\"Vátápi, thou with cruel spiteHast conquered many an anchoriteThe noblest of the Bráhman caste,--And now thy ruin comes at last.\"Now if my power he thus defies,This giant, like Vátápi dies,Daring to scorn a man like me,A self subduing devotee.Yea, as Agastya slew the foe,My hand shall lay Márícha lowClad in thine arms thy bow in hand,To guard the Maithil lady stand,With watchful eye and thoughtful breastKeeping each word of my behestI go, and hunting through the brakeThis wondrous deer will bring or take.Yea surely I will bring the spoilReturning from my hunter toilSee, Lakshman how my consort eyesAre longing for the lovely prize.This day it falls, that I may winThe treasure of so fair a skin.Do thou and Sítá watch with careLest danger seize you unaware.Swift from my bow one shaft will fly;The stricken deer will fall and dieThen quickly will I strip the gameAnd bring the trophy to my dame.Jatáyus, guardian good and wise,Our old and faithful friend,The best and strongest bird that flies,His willing aid will lendThe Maithil lady well protect,For every chance provide,And in thy tender care suspectA foe on every side.\"Canto XLIV. Márícha Death.Thus having warned his brother boldHe grasped his sword with haft of gold,And bow with triple flexure bent,His own delight and ornament;Then bound two quivers to his side,And hurried forth with eager stride.Soon as the antlered monarch sawThe lord of monarchs near him draw,A while with trembling heart he fled,Then turned and showed his stately head.With sword and bow the chief pursuedWhere\\'er the fleeing deer he viewedSending from dell and lone recessThe splendour of his loveliness.Now full in view the creature stoodNow vanished in the depth of wood;Now running with a languid flight,Now like a meteor lost to sight.With trembling limbs away he sped;Then like the moon with clouds o\\'erspreadGleamed for a moment bright betweenThe trees, and was again unseen.Thus in the magic deer disguiseMárícha lured him to the prize,And seen a while, then lost to view,Far from his cot the hero drew.Still by the flying game deceivedThe hunter heart was wroth and grieved,And wearied with the fruitless chaseHe stayed him in a shady place.Again the rover of the nightEnraged the chieftain, full in sight,Slow moving in the coppice near,Surrounded by the woodland deer.Again the hunter sought the gameThat seemed a while to court his aim:But seized again with sudden dread,Beyond his sight the creature fled.Again the hero left the shade,Again the deer before him strayed.With surer hope and stronger willThe hunter longed his prey to kill.Then as his soul impatient grew,An arrow from his side he drew,Resplendent at the sunbeam glow,The crusher of the smitten foe.With skillful heed the mighty lordFixed well shaft and strained the cord.Upon the deer his eyes he bent,And like a fiery serpent wentThe arrow Brahma self had framed,Alive with sparks that hissed and flamed,Like Indra flashing levin, trueTo the false deer the missile flewCleaving his flesh that wonderous dartStood quivering in Márícha heart.Scarce from the ground one foot he sprang,Then stricken fell with deadly pang.Half lifeless, as he pressed the ground,He gave a roar of awful soundAnd ere the wounded giant diedHe threw his borrowed form asideRemembering still his lord behestHe pondered in his heart how bestSítá might send her guard away,And Rávan seize the helpless prey.The monster knew the time was nigh,And called aloud with eager cry,\"Ho, Sítá, Lakshman\" and the toneHe borrowed was like Ráma own.So by that matchless arrow cleft,The deer bright form Márícha left,Resumed his giant shape and sizeAnd closed in death his languid eyes.When Ráma saw his awful foeGasp, smeared with blood, in deadly throe,His anxious thoughts to Sítá sped,And the wise words that Lakshman said,That this was false Márícha art,Returned again upon his heart.He knew the foe he triumphed o\\'erThe name of great Márícha bore.\"The fiend,\" he pondered, \\'ere he died,\"Ho, Lakshman! ho, my Sítá!\" criedAh, if that cry has reached her ear,How dire must be my darling fear!And Lakshman of the mighty arm,What thinks he in his wild alarm?As thus he thought in sad surmise,Each startled hair began to rise,And when he saw the giant slainAnd thought upon that cry again,His spirit sank and terror pressedFull sorely on the hero breast.Another deer he chased and struck,He bore away the the fallen buck,To Janasthán then turned his faceAnd hastened to his dwelling place.Canto XLV. Lakshman Departure.But Sítá hearing as she thought,Her husband cry with anguish fraught,Called to her guardian, \"Lakshman, runAnd in the wood seek Raghu son.Scarce can my heart retain its throne,Scarce can my life be called mine own,As all my powers and senses failAt that long, loud and bitter wail.Haste to the wood with all thy speedAnd save thy brother in his need.Go, save him in the distant gladeWhere loud he calls, for timely aid.He falls beneath some giant foe--A bull whom lions overthrow.\"Deaf to her prayer, no step he stirredObedient to his mother word,Then Janak child, with ire inflamed,In words of bitter scorn exclaimed exclaimed\"Sumitrá son, a friend in show,Thou art in truth thy brother foe,Who canst at such any hour denyThy succour and neglect his cry.Yes, Lakshman, smit with love of meThy brother death thou fain wouldst see.This guilty love thy heart has swayedAnd makes thy feet so loth to aid.Thou hast no love for Ráma, no:Thy joy is vice, thy thoughts are lowHence thus unmoved thou yet canst stayWhile my dear lord is far away.If aught of ill my lord betideWho led thee here, thy chief and guide,Ah, what will be my hapless fateLeft in the wild wood desolate!\"Thus spoke the lady sad with fear,With many a sigh and many a tear,Still trembling like a captured doe:And Lakshman spoke to calm her woe:\"Videhan Queen, be sure of this,--And at the thought thy fear dismiss,--Thy husband mightier power defiesAll Gods and angels of the skies,Gandharvas, and the sons of light,Serpents, and rovers of the night.I tell thee, of the sons of earth,Of Gods who boast celestial birth,Of beasts and birds and giant hosts,Of demigods, Gandharvas, ghosts,Of awful fiends, O thou most fair,There lives not one whose heart would dareTo meet thy Ráma in the fight,Like Indra self unmatched in might.Such idle words thou must not sayThy Ráma lives whom none may slay.I will not, cannot leave thee hereIn the wild wood till he be near.The mightiest strength can ne\\'er withstandHis eager force, his vigorous hand.No, not the triple world alliedWith all the immortal Gods beside.Dismiss thy fear, again take heart,Let all thy doubt and woe depart.Thy lord, be sure, will soon be hereAnd bring thee back that best of deer.Not his, not his that mournful cry,Nor haply came it from the sky.Some giant art was busy thereAnd framed a castle based on air.A precious pledge art thou, consignedTo me by him of noblest mind,Nor can I fairest dame, forsakeThe pledge which Ráma bade me take.Upon our heads, O Queen, we drewThe giants\\' hate when Ráma slewTheir chieftain Khara, and the shadeOf Janasthán in ruin laid.Through all this mighty wood they roveWith varied cries from grove to groveOn rapine bent they wander here:But O, dismiss thy causeless fear.\"Bright flashed her eye as Lakshman spokeAnd forth her words of fury brokeUpon her truthful guardian, flungWith bitter taunts that pierced and stung:\"Shame on such false compassion, baseDefiler of thy glorious race!\\'Twere joyous sight I ween to theeMy lord in direst strait to see.Thou knowest Ráma sore bested,Or word like this thou ne\\'er hadst said.No marvel if we find such sinIn rivals false to kith and kin.Wretches like thee of evil kind,Concealing crime with crafty mind.Thou, wretch, thine aid wilt still deny,And leave my lord alone to die.Has love of me unnerved thy hand,Or Bharat art this ruin planned?But be the treachery his or thine,In vain, in vain the base design.For how shall I, the chosen brideOf dark-hued Ráma, lotus-eyed,The queen who once called Ráma mine,To love of other men decline?Believe me, Lakshman, Ráma wifeBefore thine eyes will quit this life,And not a moment will she stayIf her dear lord have passed away.\"The lady bitter speech, that stirredEach hair upon his frame, he heard.With lifted hands together laid,His calm reply he gently made:\"No words have I to answer now:My deity, O Queen, art thou.But \\'tis no marvel, dame, to findSuch lack of sense in womankind.Throughout this world, O Maithil dame,Weak women hearts are still the same.Inconstant, urged by envious spite,They sever friends and hate the right.I cannot brook, Videhan Queen,Thy words intolerably keen.Mine ears thy fierce reproaches painAs boiling water seethes the brain.And now to bear me witness allThe dwellers in the wood I call,That, when with words of truth I plead,This harsh reply is all my meed.Ah, woe is thee! Ah, grief, that stillEager to do my brother will,Mourning thy woman nature, IMust see thee doubt my truth and die.I fly to Ráma side, and Oh,May bliss attend thee while I go!May all attendant wood-gods screenThy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen!And though dire omens meet my sightAnd fill my soul with wild affright,May I return in peace and seeThe son of Raghu safe with thee!\"The child of Janak heard him speak,And the hot tear-drops down her cheek,Increasing to a torrent, ran,As thus once more the dame began:\"O Lakshman, if I widowed beGodávarí flood shall cover me,Or I will die by cord, or leap,Life weary, from yon rocky steep;Or deadly poison will I drink,Or \\'neath the kindled flames will sink,But never, reft of Ráma, canConsent to touch a meaner man.\"The Maithil dame with many sighs,And torrents pouring from her eyes,The faithful Lakshman thus addressed,And smote her hands upon her breast.>Sumitrá son, o\\'erwhelmed by fears,Looked on the large-eyed queen:He saw that flood of burning tears,He saw that piteous mien.He yearned sweet comfort to afford,He strove to soothe her pain;But to the brother of her lordShe spoke no word again.His reverent hands once more he raised,His head he slightly bent,Upon her face he sadly gazed,And then toward Ráma went.Canto XLVI. The Guest.The angry Lakshman scarce could brookHer bitter words, her furious look.With dark forebodings in his breastTo Ráma side he quickly pressed.Then ten necked Rávan saw the timePropitious for his purposed crime.A mendicant in guise he cameAnd stood before the Maithil dame.His garb was red, with tufted hairAnd sandalled feet a shade he bare,And from the fiend left shoulder slungA staff and water-vessel hung.Near to the lovely dame he drew,While both the chiefs were far from view,As darkness takes the evening airWhen neither sun nor moon is there.He bent his eye upon the dame,A princess fair, of spotless fame:So might some baleful planet beNear Moon-forsaken Rohiní.(495)As the fierce tyrant nearer drew,The trees in Janasthán that grewWaved not a leaf for fear and woe,And the hushed wind forbore to blow.Godávarí waters as they fled,Saw his fierce eye-balls flashing red,And from each swiftly-gliding waveA melancholy murmur gave.Then Rávan, when his eager eyeBeheld the longed-for moment nigh,In mendicant apparel dressedNear to the Maithil lady pressed.In holy guise, a fiend abhorred,He found her mourning for her lord.Thus threatening draws Sanischar(496) nighTo Chitrá(497) in the evening sky;Thus the deep well by grass concealedYawns treacherous in the verdant field.He stood and looked upon the dameOf Ráma, queen of spotless fameWith her bright teeth and each fair limbLike the full moon she seemed to him,Sitting within her leafy cot,Weeping for woe that left her not.Thus, while with joy his pulses beat,He saw her in her lone retreat,Eyed like the lotus, fair to viewIn silken robes of amber hue.Pierced to the core by Káma dartHe murmured texts with lying art,And questioned with a soft addressThe lady in her loneliness.The fiend essayed with gentle speechThe heart of that fair dame to reach,Pride of the worlds, like Beauty QueenWithout her darling lotus seen:\"O thou whose silken robes enfoldA form more fair than finest gold,With lotus garland on thy head,Like a sweet spring with bloom o\\'erspread,Who art thou, fair one, what thy name,Beauty, or Honour, Fortune, Fame,Spirit, or nymph, or Queen of loveDescended from thy home above?Bright as the dazzling jasmine shineThy small square teeth in level line.Like two black stars aglow with lightThine eyes are large and pure and bright.Thy charms of smile and teeth and hairAnd winning eyes, O thou most fair,Steal all my spirit, as the flowOf rivers mines the bank below.How bright, how fine each flowing tress!How firm those orbs beneath thy dress!That dainty waist with ease were spanned,Sweet lady, by a lover hand.Mine eyes, O beauty, ne\\'er have seenGoddess or nymph so fair of mien,Or bright Gandharva heavenly dame,Or woman of so perfect frame.In youth soft prime thy years are few,And earth has naught so fair to view.I marvel one like thee in faceShould make the woods her dwelling-place.Leave, lady, leave this lone retreatIn forest wilds for thee unmeet,Where giants fierce and strong assumeAll shapes and wander in the gloom.These dainty feet were formed to treadSome palace floor with carpets spread,Or wander in trim gardens whereEach opening bud perfumes the air.The richest robe thy form should deck,The rarest gems adorn thy neck,The sweetest wreath should bind thy hair,The noblest lord thy bed should share.Art thou akin, O fair of form,To Rudras,(498) or the Gods of storm,(499)Or to the glorious Vasus(500)? HowCan less than these be bright as thou?But never nymph or heavenly maidOr Goddess haunts this gloomy shade.Here giants roam, a savage race;What led thee to so dire a place?Here monkeys leap from tree to tree,And bears and tigers wander free;Here ravening lions prowl, and fellHyenas in the thickets yell,And elephants infuriate roam,Mighty and fierce, their woodland home.Dost thou not dread, so soft and fair,Tiger and lion, wolf and bear?Hast thou, O beauteous dame, no fearIn the wild wood so lone and drear?Whose and who art thou? whence and whySweet lady, with no guardian nigh,Dost thou this awful forest treadBy giant bands inhabited?\"The praise the high-souled Rávan spokeNo doubt within her bosom woke.His saintly look and Bráhman guiseDeceived the lady trusting eyes.With due attention on the guestHer hospitable rites she pressed.She bade the stranger to a seat,And gave him water for his feet.The bowl and water-pot he bare,And garb which wandering Bráhmans wearForbade a doubt to rise.Won by his holy look she deemedThe stranger even as he seemedTo her deluded eyes.Intent on hospitable care,She brought her best of woodland fare,And showed her guest a seat.She bade the saintly stranger laveHis feet in water which she gave,And sit and rest and eat.He kept his eager glances bentOn her so kindly eloquent,Wife of the noblest king;And longed in heart to steal her thence,Preparing by the dire offence,Death on his head to bring.The lady watched with anxious faceFor Ráma coming from the chaseWith Lakshman by his side:But nothing met her wandering glanceSave the wild forest green expanseExtending far and wide.Canto XLVII. Rávan Wooing.As, clad in mendicant disguise,He questioned thus his destined prize,She to the seeming saintly manThe story of her life began.\"My guest is he,\" she thought, \"and I,To cape his curse, must needs reply:\"\"Child of a noble sire I springFrom Janak, fair Videha king.May every good be thine! my nameIs Sítá, Ráma cherished dame.Twelve winters with my lord I spentMost happily with sweet contentIn the rich home of Raghu line,And every earthly joy was mine.Twelve pleasant years flew by, and thenHis peers advised the king of men,Ráma, my lord, to consecrateJoint ruler of his ancient state.But when the rites were scarce begun,To consecrate Ikshváku son,The queen Kaikeyí, honoured dame,Sought of her lord an ancient claim.Her plea of former service pressed,And made him grant her new request,To banish Ráma to the wildAnd consecrate instead her child.This double prayer on him, the bestAnd truest king, she strongly pressed:\"Mine eyes in sleep I will not close,Nor eat, nor drink, nor take repose.This very day my death shall bringIf Ráma be anointed king.\"As thus she spake in envious ire,The aged king, my husband sire,Besought with fitting words; but sheWas cold and deaf to every plea.As yet my days are few; eighteenThe years of life that I have seen;And Ráma, best of all alive,Has passed of years a score and five--Ráma the great and gentle, throughAll region famed as pure and true,Large-eyed and mighty-armed and tall,With tender heart that cares for all.But Dasaratha, led astrayBy woman wile and passion sway,By his strong love of her impelled,The consecrating rites withheld.When, hopeful of the promised grace,My Ráma sought his father face,The queen Kaikeyí, ill at ease,Spoke to my lord brief words like these:\"Hear, son of Raghu, hear from meThe words thy father says to thee:\"I yield this day to Bharat hand,Free from all foes, this ancient land.Fly from this home no longer thine,And dwell in woods five years and nine.Live in the forest and maintainMine honour pure from falsehood stain.\\' \"Then Ráma spoke, untouched by dread:\"Yea, it shall be as thou hast said.\"And answered, faithful to his vows,Obeying Dasaratha spouse:\"The offered realm I would not take,But still keep true the words he spake.\"Thus, gentle Bráhman, Ráma stillClung to his vow with firmest will.And valiant Lakshman, dear to fame,His brother by a younger dame,Bold victor in the deadly fray,Would follow Ráma on his way.On sternest vows his heart was set,And he, a youthful anchoret,Bound up in twisted coil his hairAnd took the garb which hermits wear;Then with his bow to guard us, heWent forth with Ráma and with me.By Queen Kaikeyí art bereftThe kingdom and our home we left,And bound by stern religious vowsWe sought this shade of forest boughs.Now, best of Bráhmans, here we treadThese pathless regions dark and dread.But come, refresh thy soul, and restHere for a while an honoured guest,For he, my lord, will soon be hereWith fresh supply of woodland cheer,Large store of venison of the buck,Or some great boar his hand has struck.Meanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:Thy name, thy race, thy birth declare,And why with no companion thouRoamest in Dandak forest now.\"Thus questioned Sítá, Ráma dame.Then fierce the stranger answer came:\"Lord of the giant legions, heFrom whom celestial armies flee,--The dread of hell and earth and sky,Rávan the Rákshas king am I.Now when thy gold-like form I viewArrayed in silks of amber hue,My love, O thou of perfect mould,For all my dames is dead and cold.A thousand fairest women, tornFrom many a land my home adorn.But come, loveliest lady, beThe queen of every dame and me.My city Lanká, glorious town,Looks from a mountain forehead downWhere ocean with his flash and foamBeats madly on mine island home.With me, O Sítá, shalt thou roveDelighted through each shady grove,Nor shall thy happy breast retainFond memory of this life of pain.In gay attire, a glittering band,Five thousand maids shall round thee stand,And serve thee at thy beck and sign,If thou, fair Sítá, wilt be mine.\"Then forth her noble passion brokeAs thus in turn the lady spoke:\"Me, me the wife of Ráma, himThe lion lord with lion limb,Strong as the sea, firm as the rock,Like Indra in the battle shock.The lord of each auspicious sign,The glory of his princely line,Like some fair Bodh tree strong and tall,The noblest and the best of all,Ráma, the heir of happy fateWho keeps his word inviolate,Lord of the lion gait, possessedOf mighty arm and ample chest,Ráma the lion-warrior, himWhose moon bright face no fear can dim,Ráma, his bridled passions\\' lord,The darling whom his sire adored,--Me, me the true and loving dameOf Ráma, prince of deathless fame--Me wouldst thou vainly woo and press?A jackal woo a lioness!Steal from the sun his glory! suchThy hope Lord Ráma wife to touch.Ha! Thou hast seen the trees of gold,The sign which dying eyes behold,Thus seeking, weary of thy life,To win the love of Ráma wife.Fool! wilt thou dare to rend awayThe famished lion bleeding prey,Or from the threatening jaws to takeThe fang of some envenomed snake?What, wouldst thou shake with puny handMount Mandar,(501) towering o\\'er the land,Put poison to thy lips and thinkThe deadly cup a harmless drink?With pointed needle touch thine eye,A razor to thy tongue apply,Who wouldst pollute with impious touchThe wife whom Ráma loves so much?Be round thy neck a millstone tied,And swim the sea from side to side;Or raising both thy hands on highPluck sun and moon from yonder sky;Or let the kindled flame be pressed,Wrapt in thy garment, to thy breast;More wild the thought that seeks to winRáma dear wife who knows not sin.The fool who thinks with idle aimTo gain the love of Ráma dame,With dark and desperate footing makesHis way o\\'er points of iron stakes.As Ocean to a bubbling spring,The lion to a fox, the kingOf all the birds that ply the wingTo an ignoble crowAs gold to lead of little price,As to the drainings of the riceThe drink they quaff in Paradise,The Amrit heavenly flow,As sandal dust with perfume sweetIs to the mire that soils our feet,A tiger to a cat,As the white swan is to the owl,The peacock to the waterfowl,An eagle to a bat,Such is my lord compared with thee;And when with bow and arrows he,Mighty as Indra self shall seeHis foeman, armed to slay,Thou, death-doomed like the fly that sipsThe oil that on the altar drips,Shalt cast the morsel from thy lipsAnd lose thy half-won prey.\"Thus in high scorn the lady flungThe biting arrows of her tongueIn bitter words that pierced and stungThe rover of the night.She ceased. Her gentle cheek grew pale,Her loosened limbs began to fail,And like a plantain in the galeShe trembled with affright.He terrible as Death stood nigh,And watched with fierce exulting eyeThe fear that shook her frame.To terrify the lady more,He counted all his triumphs o\\'er,Proclaimed the titles that he bore,His pedigree and name.Canto XLVIII. Rávan Speech.With knitted brow and furious eyeThe stranger made his fierce reply:\"In me O fairest dame, beholdThe brother of the King of Gold.The Lord of Ten Necks my title, namedRávan, for might and valour famed.Gods and Gandharva hosts I scare;Snakes, spirits, birds that roam the airFly from my coming, wild with fear,Trembling like men when Death is near.Vaisravan once, my brother, wroughtTo ire, encountered me and fought,But yielding to superior mightFled from his home in sore affright.Lord of the man-drawn chariot, stillHe dwells on famed Kailása hill.I made the vanquished king resignThe glorious car which now is mine,--Pushpak, the far-renowned, that fliesWill-guided through the buxom skies.Celestial hosts by Indra ledFlee from my face disquieted,And where my dreaded feet appearThe wind is hushed or breathless is fear.Where\\'er I stand, where\\'er I goThe troubled waters cease to flow,Each spell-bound wave is mute and stillAnd the fierce sun himself is chill.Beyond the sea my Lanká standsFilled with fierce forms and giant bands,A glorious city fair to seeAs Indra Amarávatí.A towering height of solid wall,Flashing afar, surrounds it all,Its golden courts enchant the sight,And gates aglow with lazulite.Steeds, elephants, and cars are there,And drums\\' loud music fills the air,Fair trees in lovely gardens growWhose boughs with varied fruitage glow.Thou, beauteous Queen, with me shalt dwellIn halls that suit a princess well,Thy former fellows shall forgetNor think of women with regret,No earthly joy thy soul shall miss,And take its fill of heavenly bliss.Of mortal Ráma think no more,Whose terms of days will soon be o\\'er.King Dasaratha looked in scornOn Ráma though the eldest born,Sent to the woods the weakling fool,And set his darling son to rule.What, O thou large-eyed dame, hast thouTo do with fallen Ráma now,From home and kingdom forced to fly,A wretched hermit soon to die?Accept thy lover, nor refuseThe giant king who fondly woos.O listen, nor reject in scornA heart by Káma arrows torn.If thou refuse to hear my prayer,Of grief and coming woe beware;For the sad fate will fall on theeWhich came on hapless Urvasí,When with her foot she chanced to touchPurúravas, and sorrowed much.(502)My little finger raised in fightWere more than match for Ráma might.O fairest, blithe and happy beWith him whom fortune sends to thee.\"Such were the words the giant said,And Sítá angry eyes were red.She answered in that lonely placeThe monarch of the giant race:\"Art thou the brother of the LordOf Gold by all the world adored,And sprung of that illustrious seedWouldst now attempt this evil deed?I tell thee, impious Monarch, allThe giants by thy sin will fall,Whose reckless lord and king thou art,With foolish mind and lawless heart.Yea, one may hope to steal the wifeOf Indra and escape with life.But he who Ráma dame would tearFrom his loved side must needs despair.Yea, one may steal fair Sachí, dameOf Him who shoots the thunder flame,May live successful in his aimAnd length of day may see;But hope, O giant King, in vain,Though cups of Amrit thou may drain,To shun the penalty and painOf wronging one like me.\"Canto XLIX. The Rape Of Sítá.The Rákshas monarch, thus addressed,His hands a while together pressed,And straight before her startled eyesStood monstrous in his giant size.Then to the lady, with the loreOf eloquence, he spoke once more:\"Thou scarce,\" he cried, \"hast heard arightThe glories of my power and might.I borne sublime in air can standAnd with these arms upheave the land,Drink the deep flood of Ocean dryAnd Death with conquering force defy,Pierce the great sun with furious dartAnd to her depths cleave earth apart.See, thou whom love and beauty blind,I wear each form as wills my mind.\"As thus he spake in burning ireHis glowing eyes were red with fire.His gentle garb aside was thrownAnd all his native shape was shown.Terrific, monstrous, wild, and dreadAs the dark God who rules the dead,His fiery eyes in fury rolled,His limbs were decked with glittering gold.Like some dark cloud the monster showed,And his fierce breast with fury glowed.The ten-faced rover of the night,With twenty arms exposed to sight,His saintly guise aside had laidAnd all his giant height displayed.Attired in robes of crimson dyeHe stood and watched with angry eyeThe lady in her bright arrayResplendent as the dawn of dayWhen from the east the sunbeams break,And to the dark-haired lady spake:\"If thou would call that lord thine ownWhose fame in every world is known,Look kindly on my love, and beBride of a consort meet for thee.With me let blissful years be spent,For ne\\'er thy choice shalt thou repent.No deed of mine shall e\\'er displeaseMy darling as she lives at ease.Thy love for mortal man resign,And to a worthier lord incline.Ah foolish lady, seeming wiseIn thine own weak and partial eyes,By what fair graces art thou heldTo Ráma from his realm expelled?Misfortunes all his life attend,And his brief days are near their end.Unworthy prince, infirm of mind!A woman spoke and he resignedHis home and kingdom and withdrewFrom troops of friends and retinue.And sought this forest dark and dreadBy savage beasts inhabited.\"Thus Rávan urged the lady meetFor love, whose words were soft and sweet.Near and more near the giant pressedAs love hot fire inflamed his breast.The leader of the giant crewHis arm around the lady threw:Thus Budha(503) with ill-omened mightSteals Rohiní delicious light.One hand her glorious tresses grasped,One with its ruthless pressure claspedThe body of his lovely prize,The Maithil dame with lotus eyes.The silvan Gods in wild alarmMarked his huge teeth and ponderous arm,And from that Death-like presence fled,Of mountain size and towering head.Then seen was Rávan magic carAglow with gold which blazed afar,--The mighty car which asses drewThundering as it onward flew.He spared not harsh rebuke to chideThe lady as she moaned and cried,Then with his arm about her waistHis captive in the car he placed.In vain he threatened: long and shrillRang out her lamentation still,O Ráma! which no fear could stay:But her dear lord was far away.Then rose the fiend, and toward the skiesBore his poor helpless struggling prize:Hurrying through the air aboveThe dame who loathed his proffered love.So might a soaring eagle bearA serpent consort through the air.As on he bore her through the skyShe shrieked aloud her bitter cry.As when some wretch lips complainIn agony of maddening pain;\"O Lakshman, thou whose joy is stillTo do thine elder brother will,This fiend, who all disguises wears,From Ráma side his darling tears.Thou who couldst leave bliss, fortune, all,Yea life itself at duty call,Dost thou not see this outrage doneTo hapless me, O Raghu son?\\'Tis thine, O victor of the foe,To bring the haughtiest spirit low,How canst thou such an outrage seeAnd let the guilty fiend go free?Ah, seldom in a moment timeComes bitter fruit of sin and crime,But in the day of harvest painComes like the ripening of the grain.So thou whom fate and folly leadTo ruin for this guilty deed,Shalt die by Ráma arm ere longA dreadful death for hideous wrong.Ah, too successful in their endsAre Queen Kaikeyí and her friends,When virtuous Ráma, dear to fame,Is mourning for his ravished dame.Ah me, ah me! a long farewellTo lawn and glade and forest dellIn Janasthán wild region, whereThe Cassia trees are bright and fairWith all your tongues to Ráma sayThat Rávan bears his wife away.Farewell, a long farewell to thee,O pleasant stream Godávarí,Whose rippling waves are ever stirredBy many a glad wild water-bird!All ye to Ráma ear relateThe giant deed and Sítá fate.O all ye Gods who love this groundWhere trees of every leaf abound,Tell Ráma I am stolen hence,I pray you all with reverence.On all the living things besideThat these dark boughs and coverts hide,Ye flocks of birds, ye troops of deer,I call on you my prayer to hear.All ye to Ráma ear proclaimThat Rávan tears away his dameWith forceful arms,--his darling wife,Dearer to Ráma than his life.O, if he knew I dwelt in hell,My mighty lord, I know full well,Would bring me, conqueror, back to-day,Though Yáma self reclaimed his prey.\"Thus from the air the lady sentWith piteous voice her last lament,And as she wept she chanced to seeThe vulture on a lofty tree.As Rávan bore her swiftly by,On the dear bird she bent her eye,And with a voice which woe made faintRenewed to him her wild complaint:\"O see, the king who rules the raceOf giants, cruel, fierce and base,Rávan the spoiler bears me henceThe helpless prey of violence.This fiend who roves in midnight shadeBy thee, dear bird, can ne\\'er be stayed,For he is armed and fierce and strongTriumphant in the power to wrong.For thee remains one only task,To do, kind friend, the thing I ask.To Ráma ear by thee be borneHow Sítá from her home is torn,And to the valiant Lakshman tellThe giant deed and what befell.\"Canto L. Jatáyus.The vulture from his slumber wokeAnd heard the words which Sítá spokeHe raised his eye and looked on her,Looked on her giant ravisher.That noblest bird with pointed beak,Majestic as a mountain peak,High on the tree addressed the kingOf giants, wisely counselling:\"O Ten-necked lord, I firmly holdTo faith and laws ordained of old,And thou, my brother, shouldst refrainFrom guilty deeds that shame and stain.The vulture king supreme in air,Jatáyus is the name I bear.Thy captive, known by Sítá name,Is the dear consort and the dameOf Ráma, Dasaratha heirWho makes the good of all his care.Lord of the world in might he viesWith the great Gods of seas and skies.The law he boasts to keep allowsNo king to touch another spouse,And, more than all, a prince dameHigh honour and respect may claim.Back to the earth thy way incline,Nor think of one who is not thine.Heroic souls should hold it shameTo stoop to deeds which others blame,And all respect by them is shownTo dames of others as their own.Not every case of bliss and gainThe Scripture holy texts explain,And subjects, when that light is dim,Look to their prince and follow him.The king is bliss and profit, heIs store of treasures fair to see,And all the people fortunes spring,Their joy and misery, from the king.If, lord of giant race, thy mindBe fickle, false, to sin inclined,How wilt thou kingly place retain?High thrones in heaven no sinners gain.The soul which gentle passions swayNe\\'er throws its nobler part away,Nor will the mansion of the baseLong be the good man dwelling-place.Prince Ráma, chief of high renown,Has wronged thee not in field or town.Ne\\'er has he sinned against thee: howCanst thou resolve to harm him now?If moved by Súrpanakhá prayerThe giant Khara sought him there,And fighting fell with baffled aim,His and not Ráma is the blame.Say, mighty lord of giants, sayWhat fault on Ráma canst thou lay?What has the world great master doneThat thou should steal his precious one?Quick, quick the Maithil dame release;Let Ráma consort go in peace,Lest scorched by his terrific eyeBeneath his wrath thou fall and dieLike Vritra when Lord Indra threwThe lightning flame that smote and slew.Ah fool, with blinded eyes to takeHome to thy heart a venomed snake!Ah foolish eyes, too blind to seeThat Death dire coils entangle thee!The prudent man his strength will spare,Nor lift a load too great to bear.Content is he with wholesome foodWhich gives him life and strength renewed,But who would dare the guilty deedThat brings no fame or glorious meed,Where merit there is none to winAnd vengeance soon o\\'ertakes the sin?My course of life, Pulastya son,For sixty thousand years has run.Lord of my kind I still maintainMine old hereditary reign.I, worn by years, am older farThan thou, young lord of bow and car,In coat of glittering mail encasedAnd armed with arrows at thy waist,But not unchallenged shalt thou go,Or steal the dame without a blow.Thou canst not, King, before mine eyesBear off unchecked thy lovely prize,Safe as the truth of Scripture bentBy no close logic argument.Stay if thy courage let thee, stayAnd meet me in the battle fray,And thou shalt stain the earth with goreFalling as Khara fell before.Soon Ráma, clothed in bark, shall smiteThee, his proud foe, in deadly fight,--Ráma, from whom have oft times fledThe Daitya hosts discomfited.No power have I to kill or slay:The princely youths are far away,But soon shalt thou with fearful eyeStruck down beneath their arrows lie.But while I yet have life and sense,Thou shalt not, tyrant, carry henceFair Sítá, Ramá honoured queen,With lotus eyes and lovely mien.Whate\\'er the pain, whate\\'er the cost,Though in the struggle life be lost,The will of Raghu noblest sonAnd Dasaratha must be done.Stay for a while, O Rávan, stay,One hour thy flying car delay,And from that glorious chariot thouShalt fall like fruit from shaken bough,For I to thee, while yet I live,The welcome of a foe will give.\"Canto LI. The Combat.Rávan red eyes in fury rolled:Bright with his armlets\\' flashing gold,In high disdain, by passion stirredHe rushed against the sovereign bird.With clash and din and furious blowsOf murderous battle met the foes:Thus urged by winds two clouds on highMeet warring in the stormy sky.Then fierce the dreadful combat ragedAs fiend and bird in war engaged,As if two winged mountains spedTo dire encounter overhead.Keen pointed arrows thick and fast,In never ceasing fury cast,Rained hurtling on the vulture kingAnd smote him on the breast and wing.But still that noblest bird sustainedThe cloud of shafts which Rávan rained,And with strong beak and talons bentThe body of his foeman rent.Then wild with rage the ten-necked kingLaid ten swift arrows on his string,--Dread as the staff of Death were they,So terrible and keen to slay.Straight to his ear the string he drew,Straight to the mark the arrows flew,And pierced by every iron headThe vulture mangled body bled.One glance upon the car he bentWhere Sítá wept with shrill lament,Then heedless of his wounds and painRushed at the giant king again.Then the brave vulture with the strokeOf his resistless talons brokeThe giant shafts and bow whereonThe fairest pearls and jewels shone.The monster paused, by rage unmanned:A second bow soon armed his hand,Whence pointed arrows swift and trueIn hundreds, yea in thousands, flew.The monarch of the vultures, pliedWith ceaseless darts on every side,Showed like a bird that turns to restClose covered by the branch-built nest.He shook his pinions to repelThe storm of arrows as it fell;Then with his talons snapped in twoThe mighty bow which Rávan drew.Next with terrific wing he smoteSo fiercely on the giant coat,The harness, glittering with the glowOf fire, gave way beneath the blow.With storm of murderous strokes he beatThe harnessed asses strong and fleet,--Each with a goblin monstrous faceAnd plates of gold his neck to grace.Then on the car he turned his ire,--The will-moved car that shone like fire,And broke the glorious chariot, brokeThe golden steps and pole and yoke.The chouris and the silken shadeLike the full moon to view displayed,Together with the guards who heldThose emblems, to the ground he felled.The royal vulture hovered o\\'erThe driver head, and pierced and toreWith his strong beak and dreaded clawsHis mangled brow and cheek and jaws.With broken car and sundered bow,His charioteer and team laid low,One arm about the lady wound,Sprang the fierce giant to the ground.Spectators of the combat, allThe spirits viewed the monster fall:Lauding the vulture every oneCried with glad voice, Well done! well done!But weak with length of days, at lastThe vulture strength was failing fast.The fiend again assayed to bearThe lady through the fields of air.But when the vulture saw him riseTriumphant with his trembling prize,Bearing the sword that still was leftWhen other arms were lost or cleft,Once more, impatient of repose,Swift from the earth her champion rose,Hung in the way the fiend would take,And thus addressing Rávan spake:\"Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,Stealing the wife of Ráma, himWith lightning scars on chest and limb.A mighty host obeys his willAnd troops of slaves his palace fill;His lords of state are wise and true,Kinsmen has he and retinue.As thirsty travellers drain the cup,Thou drinkest deadly poison up.The rash and careless fool who heedsNo coming fruit of guilty deeds,A few short years of life shall see,And perish doomed to death like thee.Say whither wilt thou fly to looseThy neck from Death entangling noose,Caught like the fish that finds too lateThe hook beneath the treacherous bait?Never, O King--of this be sure--Will Raghu fiery sons endure,Terrific in their vengeful rage,This insult to their hermitage.Thy guilty hands this day have doneA deed which all reprove and shun,Unworthly of a noble chief,The pillage loved by coward thief.Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stayAnd meet me in the deadly fray.Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,And fall as Khara fell before.The fruits of former deeds o\\'erpowerThe sinner in his dying hour:And such a fate on thee, O King,Thy tyranny and madness bring.Not e\\'en the Self-existent Lord,Who reigns by all the worlds adored,Would dare attempt a guilty deedWhich the dire fruits of crime succeed.\"Thus brave Jatáyus, best of birds,Addressed the fiend with moving words,Then ready for the swift attackSwooped down upon the giant back.Down to the bone the talons went;With many a wound the flesh was rent:Such blows infuriate drivers dealTheir elephants with pointed steel.Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,The talons stripped the flesh away.He fought with claws and beak and wing,And tore the long hair of the king.Still as the royal vulture beatThe giant with his wings and feet,Swelled the fiend lips, his body shookWith furious rage too great to brook.About the Maithil dame he castOne huge left arm and held her fast.In furious rage to frenzy fannedHe struck the vulture with his hand.Jatáyus mocked the vain assay,And rent his ten left arms away.Down dropped the severed limbs: anewTen others from his body grew:Thus bright with pearly radiance glideDread serpents from the hillock side,Again in wrath the giant pressedThe lady closer to his breast,And foot and fist sent blow on blowIn ceaseless fury at the foe.So fierce and dire the battle, wagedBetween those mighty champions, raged:Here was the lord of giants, thereThe noblest of the birds of air.Thus, as his love of Ráma taught,The faithful vulture strove and fought.But Rávan seized his sword and smoteHis wings and side and feet and throat.At mangled side and wing he bled;He fell, and life was almost fled.The lady saw her champion lie,His plumes distained with gory dye,And hastened to the vulture sideGrieving as though a kinsman died.The lord of Lanká island viewedThe vulture as he lay:Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,His breast a paly grey,Like ashes, when by none renewed,The flame has died away.The lady saw with mournful eye,Her champion press the plain,--The royal bird, her true allyWhom Rávan might had slain.Her soft arms locked in strict embraceAround his neck she kept,And lovely with her moon-bright faceBent o\\'er her friend and wept.Canto LII. Rávan Flight.Fair as the lord of silvery raysWhom every star in heaven obeys,The Maithil dame her plaint renewedO\\'er him by Rávan might subdued:\"Dreams, omens, auguries foreshowOur coming lot of weal and woe:But thou, my Ráma, couldst not seeThe grievous blow which falls on thee.The birds and deer desert the brakesAnd show the path my captor takes,And thus e\\'en now this royal birdFlew to mine aid by pity stirred.Slain for my sake in death he lies,The broad-winged rover of the skies.O Ráma, haste, thine aid I crave:O Lakshman, why delay to save?Brave sons of old Ikshváku, hearAnd rescue in this hour of fear.\"Her flowery wreath was torn and rent,Crushed was each sparkling ornament.She with weak arms and trembling kneesClung like a creeper to the trees,And like some poor deserted thingWith wild shrieks made the forest ring.But swift the giant reached her side,As loud on Ráma name she cried.Fierce as grim Death one hand he laidUpon her tresses\\' lovely braid.\"That touch, thou impious King, shall beThe ruin of thy race and thee.\"The universal world in aweThat outrage on the lady saw,All nature shook convulsed with dread,And darkness o\\'er the land was spread.The Lord of Day grew dark and chill,And every breath of air was still.The Eternal Father of the skyBeheld the crime with heavenly eye,And spake with solemn voice, \"The deed,The deed is done, of old decreed.\"Sad were the saints within the grove,But triumph with their sorrow strove.They wept to see the Maithil dameEndure the outrage, scorn, and shame:They joyed because his life should payThe penalty incurred that day.Then Rávan raised her up, and bareHis captive through the fields of air,Calling with accents loud and shrillOn Ráma and on Lakshman still.With sparkling gems on arm and breast,In silk of paly amber dressed,High in the air the Maithil dameGleamed like the lightning flashing flame.The giant, as the breezes blewUpon her robes of amber hue,And round him twined that gay attire,Showed like a mountain girt with fire.The lady, fairest of the fair,Had wreathed a garland round her hair;Its lotus petals bright and sweetRained down about the giant feet.Her vesture, bright as burning gold,Gave to the wind each glittering fold,Fair as a gilded cloud that gleamsTouched by the Day-God tempered beams.Yet struggling in the fiend embrace,The lady with her sweet pure face,Far from her lord, no longer woreThe light of joy that shone before.Like some sad lily by the sideOf waters which the sun has dried;Like the pale moon uprising throughAn autumn cloud of darkest hue,So was her perfect face betweenThe arms of giant Rávan seen:Fair with the charm of braided tressAnd forehead finished loveliness;Fair with the ivory teeth that shedWhite lustre through the lips\\' fine red,Fair as the lotus when the budIs rising from the parent flood.With faultless lip and nose and eye,Dear as the moon that floods the skyWith gentle light, of perfect mould,She seemed a thing of burnished gold,Though on her cheek the traces layOf tears her hand had brushed away.But as the moon-beams swiftly fadeEre the great Day-God shines displayed,So in that form of perfect graceStill trembling in the fiend embrace,From her beloved Ráma reft,No light of pride or joy was left.The lady with her golden hueO\\'er the swart fiend a lustre threw,As when embroidered girths enfoldAn elephant with gleams of gold.Fair as the lily bending stem,--Her arms adorned with many a gem,A lustre to the fiend she lentGleaming from every ornament,As when the cloud-shot flashes lightThe shadows of a mountain height.Whene\\'er the breezes earthward boreThe tinkling of the zone she wore,He seemed a cloud of darkness hueSending forth murmurs as it flew.As on her way the dame was spedFrom her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,The swift wind caught the flowery rainAnd poured it o\\'er the fiend again.The wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,On the dark brows of Rávan fell,Like lunar constellations setOn Meru for a coronet.From her small foot an anklet fairWith jewels slipped, and through the air,Like a bright circlet of the flameOf thunder, to the valley came.The Maithil lady, fair to seeAs the young leaflet of a treeClad in the tender hues of spring,Flashed glory on the giant king,As when a gold-embroidered zoneAround an elephant is thrown.While, bearing far the lady, throughThe realms of sky the giant flew,She like a gleaming meteor castA glory round her as she passed.Then from each limb in swift descentDropped many a sparkling ornament:On earth they rested dim and paleLike fallen stars when virtues fail.(504)Around her neck a garland layBright as the Star-God silvery ray:It fell and flashed like Gangá sentFrom heaven above the firmament.(505)The birds of every wing had flockedTo stately trees by breezes rocked:These bowed their wind-swept heads and said:\"My lady sweet, be comforted.\"With faded blooms each brook withinWhose waters moved no gleamy fin,Stole sadly through the forest dellMourning the dame it loved so well.From every woodland region nearCame lions, tigers, birds, and deer,And followed, each with furious look,The way her flying shadow took.For Sítá loss each lofty hillWhose tears were waterfall, and rill,Lifting on high each arm-like steep,Seemed in the general woe to weep.When the great sun, the lord of day,Saw Rávan tear the dame away,His glorious light began to failAnd all his disk grew cold and pale.\"If Rávan from the forest fliesWith Ráma Sítá as his prize,Justice and truth have vanished hence,Honour and right and innocence.\"Thus rose the cry of wild despairFrom spirits as they gathered there.In trembling troops in open lawnsWept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,And a strange terror changed the eyesThey lifted to the distant skies.On silvan Gods who love the dellA sudden fear and trembling fell,As in the deepest woe they viewedThe lady by the fiend subdued.Still in loud shrieks was heard afarThat voice whose sweetness naught could mar,While eager looks of fear and woeShe bent upon the earth below.The lady of each winning wileWith pearly teeth and lovely smile,Seized by the lord of Lanká isle,Looked down for friends in vain.She saw no friend to aid her, none,Not Ráma nor the younger sonOf Dasaratha, and undoneShe swooned with fear and pain.Canto LIII. Sítá Threats.Soon as the Maithil lady knewThat high through air the giant flew,Distressed with grief and sore afraidHer troubled spirit sank dismayed.Then, as anew the waters welledFrom those red eyes which sorrow swelled,Forth in keen words her passion broke,And to the fierce-eyed fiend she spoke:\"Canst thou attempt a deed so base,Untroubled by the deep disgrace,--To steal me from my home and fly,When friend or guardian none was nigh?Thy craven soul that longed to steal,Fearing the blows that warriors deal,Upon a magic deer reliedTo lure my husband from my side,Friend of his sire, the vulture kingLies low on earth with mangled wing,Who gave his aged life for meAnd died for her he sought to free.Ah, glorious strength indeed is thine,Thou meanest of thy giant line,Whose courage dared to tell thy nameAnd conquer in the fight a dame.Does the vile deed that thou hast doneCause thee no shame, thou wicked one--A woman from her home to rendWhen none was near his aid to lend?Through all the worlds, O giant King,The tidings of this deed will ring,This deed in law and honour spiteBy one who claims a hero might.Shame on thy boasted valour, shame!Thy prowess is an empty name.Shame, giant, on this cursed deedFor which thy race is doomed to bleed!Thou fliest swifter than the gale,For what can strength like thine avail?Stay for one hour, O Rávan, stay;Thou shalt not flee with life away.Soon as the royal chieftains\\' sightFalls on the thief who roams by night,Thou wilt not, tyrant, live one hourThough backed by all thy legions\\' power.Ne\\'er can thy puny strength sustainThe tempest of their arrowy rain:Have e\\'er the trembling birds withstoodThe wild flames raging in the wood?Hear me, O Rávan, let me go,And save thy soul from coming woe.Or if thou wilt not set me free,Wroth for this insult done to me.With his brave brother aid my lordAgainst thy life will raise his sword.A guilty hope inflames thy breastHis wife from Ráma home to wrest.Ah fool, the hope thou hast is vain;Thy dreams of bliss shall end in pain.If torn from all I love by theeMy godlike lord no more I see,Soon will I die and end my woes,Nor live the captive of my foes.Ah fool, with blinded eyes to chooseThe evil and the good refuse!So the sick wretch with stubborn willTurns fondly to the cates that kill,And madly draws his lips awayFrom medicine that would check decay.About thy neck securely woundThe deadly coil of Fate is bound,And thou, O Rávan, dost not fearAlthough the hour of death is near.With death-doomed sight thine eyes beholdThe gleaming of the trees of gold,--See dread Vaitarani, the floodThat rolls a stream of foamy blood,--See the dark wood by all abhorred--Its every leaf a threatening sword.The tangled thickets thou shall treadWhere thorns with iron points are spread.For never can thy days be long,Base plotter of this shame and wrongTo Ráma of the lofty soul:He dies who drinks the poisoned bowl.The coils of death around thee lie:They hold thee and thou canst not fly.Ah whither, tyrant, wouldst thou runThe vengeance of my lord to shun?By his unaided arm aloneWere twice seven thousand fiends o\\'erthrown:Yes, in the twinkling of an eyeHe forced thy mightiest fiends to die.And shall that lord of lion heart,Skilled in the bow and spear and dart,Spare thee, O fiend, in battle strife,The robber of his darling wife?\"These were her words, and more beside,By wrath and bitter hate supplied.Then by her woe and fear o\\'erthrownShe wept again and made her moan.As long she wept in grief and dread,Scarce conscious of the words she said,The wicked giant onward fledAnd bore her through the air.As firm he held the Maithil dame,Still wildly struggling, o\\'er her frameWith grief and bitter misery cameThe trembling of despair.Canto LIV. Lanká.He bore her on in rapid flight,And not a friend appeared in sight.But on a hill that o\\'er the woodRaised its high top five monkeys stood.From her fair neck her scarf she drew,And down the glittering vesture flew.With earring, necklet, chain, and gem,Descending in the midst of them:\"For these,\" she thought, \"my path may show,And tell my lord the way I go.\"Nor did the fiend, in wild alarm,Mark when she drew from neck and armAnd foot the gems and gold, and sentTo earth each gleaming ornament.The monkeys raised their tawny eyesThat closed not in their first surprise,And saw the dark-eyed lady, whereShe shrieked above them in the air.High o\\'er their heads the giant passedHolding the weeping lady fast.O\\'er Pampa flashing flood he spedAnd on to Lanká city fled.He bore away in senseless joyThe prize that should his life destroy,Like the rash fool who hugs beneathHis robe a snake with venomed teeth.Swift as an arrow from a bow,Speeding o\\'er lands that lay below,Sublime in air his course he tookO\\'er wood and rock and lake and brook.He passed at length the sounding seaWhere monstrous creatures wander free,--Seat of Lord Varun ancient reign,Controller of the eternal main.The angry waves were raised and tossedAs Rávan with the lady crossed,And fish and snake in wild unrestShowed flashing fin and gleaming crest.Then from the blessed troops who dwellIn air celestial voices fell:\"O ten-necked King,\" they cried, \"attend:This guilty deed will bring thine end.\"Then Rávan speeding like the storm,Bearing his death in human form,The struggling Sítá, lighted downIn royal Lanká glorious town;A city bright and rich, that showedWell-ordered street and noble road;Arranged with just division, fairWith multitudes in court and square.Thus, all his journey done, he passedWithin his royal home at last.There in a queenly bower he placedThe black-eyed dame with dainty waist:Thus in her chamber Máyá laidThe lovely Máyá, demon maid.Then Rávan gave command to allThe dread she-fiends who filled the hall:\"This captive lady watch and guardFrom sight of man and woman barred.But all the fair one asks besideBe with unsparing hand supplied:As though \\'twere I that asked, withholdNo pearls or dress or gems or gold.And she among you that shall dareOf purpose or through want of careOne word to vex her soul to say,Throws her unvalued life away.\"Thus spake the monarch of their raceTo those she-fiends who thronged the place,And pondering on the course to takeWent from the chamber as he spake.He saw eight giants, strong and dread,On flesh of bleeding victims fed,Proud in the boon which Brahmá gave,And trusting in its power to save.He thus the mighty chiefs addressedOf glorious power and strength possessed:\"Arm, warriors, with the spear and bow;With all your speed from Lanká go,For Janasthán, our own no more,Is now defiled with giants\\' gore;The seat of Khara royal stateIs left unto us desolate.In your brave hearts and might confide,And cast ignoble fear aside.Go, in that desert region dwellWhere the fierce giants fought and fell.A glorious host that region held,For power and might unparalleled,By Dúshan and brave Khara led,--All, slain by Ráma arrows, bled.Hence boundless wrath that spurns controlReigns paramount within my soul,And naught but Ráma death can sateThe fury of my vengeful hate.I will not close my slumbering eyesTill by this hand my foeman dies.And when mine arm has slain the foeWho laid those giant princes low,Long will I triumph in the deed,Like one enriched in utmost need.Now go; that I this end may gain,In Janasthán, O chiefs, remain.Watch Ráma there with keenest eye,And all his deeds and movements spy.Go forth, no helping art neglect,Be brave and prompt and circumspect,And be your one endeavour stillTo aid mine arm this foe to kill.Oft have I seen your warrior mightProved in the forehead of the fight,And sure of strength I know so wellSend you in Janasthán to dwell.\"The giants heard with prompt assentThe pleasant words he said,And each before his master bentFor meet salute, his head.Then as he bade, without delay,From Lanká gate they passed,And hurried forward on their wayInvisible and fast.Canto LV. Sítá In Prison.Thus Rávan his commandment gaveTo those eight giants strong and brave,So thinking in his foolish prideAgainst all dangers to provide.Then with his wounded heart aflameWith love he thought upon the dame,And took with hasty steps the wayTo the fair chamber where she lay.He saw the gentle lady thereWeighed down by woe too great to bear,Amid the throng of fiends who keptTheir watch around her as she wept:A pinnace sinking neath the waveWhen mighty winds around her rave:A lonely herd-forsaken deer,When hungry dogs are pressing near.Within the bower the giant passed:Her mournful looks were downward cast.As there she lay with streaming eyesThe giant bade the lady rise,And to the shrinking captive showedThe glories of his rich abode,Where thousand women spent their daysIn palaces with gold ablaze;Where wandered birds of every sort,And jewels flashed in hall and court.Where noble pillars charmed the sightWith diamond and lazulite,And others glorious to beholdWith ivory, crystal, silver, gold.There swelled on high the tambour sound,And burnished ore was bright aroundHe led the mournful lady whereResplendent gold adorned the stair,And showed each lattice fair to seeWith silver work and ivory:Showed his bright chambers, line on line,Adorned with nets of golden twine.Beyond he showed the Maithil dameHis gardens bright as lightning flame,And many a pool and lake he showedWhere blooms of gayest colour glowed.Through all his home from view to viewThe lady sunk in grief he drew.Then trusting in her heart to wakeDesire of all she saw, he spake:\"Three hundred million giants, allObedient to their master call,Not counting young and weak and old,Serve me with spirits fierce and bold.A thousand culled from all of theseWait on the lord they long to please.This glorious power, this pomp and sway,Dear lady, at thy feet I lay:Yea, with my life I give the whole,O dearer than my life and soul.A thousand beauties fill my hall:Be thou my wife and rule them all.O hear my supplication! whyThis reasonable prayer deny?Some pity to thy suitor show,For love hot flames within me glow.This isle a hundred leagues in length,Encompassed by the ocean strength,Would all the Gods and fiends defyThough led by Him who rules the sky.No God in heaven, no sage on earth,No minstrel of celestial birth,No spirit in the worlds I seeA match in power and might for me.What wilt thou do with Ráma, himWhose days are short, whose light is dim,Expelled from home and royal sway,Who treads on foot his weary way?Leave the poor mortal to his fate,And wed thee with a worthier mate.My timid love, enjoy with meThe prime of youth before it flee.Do not one hour the hope retainTo look on Ráma face again.For whom would wildest thought beguileTo seek thee in the giants\\' isle?Say who is he has power to bindIn toils of net the rushing wind.Whose is the mighty hand will tameAnd hold the glory of the flame?In all the worlds above, below,Not one, O fair of form, I knowWho from this isle in fight could rendThe lady whom these arms defend.Fair Queen, o\\'er Lanká island reign,Sole mistress of the wide domain.Gods, rovers of the night like me,And all the world thy slaves will be.O\\'er thy fair brows and queenly headLet consecrating balm be shed,And sorrow banished from thy breast,Enjoy my love and take thy rest.Here never more thy soul shall knowThe memory of thy former woe,And here shall thou enjoy the meedDeserved by every virtuous deed.Here garlands glow of flowery twine,With gorgeous hues and scent divine.Take gold and gems and rich attire:Enjoy with me thy heart desire.There stand, of chariots far the best,The car my brother once possessed.Which, victor in the stricken field,I forced the Lord of Gold to yield.\\'Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,Bright as the sun and swift as thought.Therein O Sítá, shalt thou rideDelighted by thy lover side.But sorrow mars with lingering traceThe splendour of thy lotus face.A cloud of woe is o\\'er it spread,And all the light of joy is fled.\"The lady, by her woe distressed,One corner of her raiment pressedTo her sad cheek like moonlight clear,And wiped away a falling tear.The rover of the night renewedHis eager pleading as he viewedThe lady stand like one distraught,Striving to fix her wandering thought:\"Think not, sweet lady, of the shameOf broken vows, nor fear the blame.The saints approve with favouring eyesThis union knit with marriage ties.O beauty, at thy radiant feetI lay my heads, and thus entreat.One word of grace, one look I crave:Have pity on thy prostrate slave.These idle words I speak are vain,Wrung forth by love consuming pain,And ne\\'er of Rávan be it saidHe wooed a dame with prostrate head.\"Thus to the Maithil lady suedThe monarch of the giant brood,And \"She is now mine own,\" he thought,In Death dire coils already caught.Canto LVI. Sítá Disdain.His words the Maithil lady heardOppressed by woe but undeterred.Fear of the fiend she cast aside,And thus in noble scorn replied:\"His word of honour never stainedKing Dasaratha nobly reigned,The bridge of right, the friend of truth.His eldest son, a noble youth,Is Ráma, virtue faithful friend,Whose glories through the worlds extend.Long arms and large full eyes has he,My husband, yea a God to me.With shoulders like the forest king,From old Ikshváku line he springs.He with his brother Lakshman aidWill smite thee with the vengeful blade.Hadst thou but dared before his eyesTo lay thine hand upon the prize,Thou stretched before his feet hadst lainIn Janasthán like Khara slain.Thy boasted rovers of the nightWith hideous shapes and giant might,--Like serpents when the feathered kingSwoops down with his tremendous wing,--Will find their useless venom failWhen Ráma mighty arms assail.The rapid arrows bright with gold,Shot from the bow he loves to hold,Will rend thy frame from flank to flankAs Gangá waves erode the bank.Though neither God nor fiend have powerTo slay thee in the battle hour,Yet from his hand shall come thy fate,Struck down before his vengeful hate.That mighty lord will strike and endThe days of life thou hast to spend.Thy days are doomed, thy life is spedLike victims to the pillar led.Yea, if the glance of Ráma brightWith fury on thy form should light,Thou scorched this day wouldst fall and dieLike Káma slain by Rudra eye.(506)He who from heaven the moon could throw,Or bid its bright rays cease to glow,--He who could drain the mighty seaWill set his darling Sítá free.Fled is thy life, thy glory, fledThy strength and power: each sense is dead.Soon Lanká widowed by thy guiltWill see the blood of giants spilt.This wicked deed, O cruel King,No triumph, no delight will bring.Thou with outrageous might and scornA woman from her lord hast torn.My glorious husband far away,Making heroic strength his stay,Dwells with his brother, void of fear,In Dandak forest lone and drear.No more in force of arms confide:That haughty strength, that power and prideMy hero with his arrowy rainFrom all thy bleeding limbs will drain.When urged by fate dire mandate, nighComes the fixt hour for men to die.Caught in Death toils their eyes are blind,And folly takes each wandering mind.So for the outrage thou hast doneThe fate is near thou canst not shun,--The fate that on thyself and allThy giants and thy town shall fall.I spurn thee: can the altar dightWith vessels for the sacred rite,O\\'er which the priest his prayer has said,Be sullied by an outcaste tread?So me, the consort dear and trueOf him who clings to virtue too,Thy hated touch shall ne\\'er defile,Base tyrant lord of Lanká isle.Can the white swan who floats in prideThrough lilies by her consort side,Look for one moment, as they pass,On the poor diver in the grass?This senseless body waits thy will,To torture, chain, to wound or kill.I will not, King of giants, striveTo keep this fleeting soul aliveBut never shall they join the nameOf Sítá with reproach and shame.\"Thus as her breast with fury burnedHer bitter speech the dame returned.Such words of rage and scorn, the lastShe uttered, at the fiend she cast.Her taunting speech the giant heard,And every hair with anger stirred.Then thus with fury in his eyeHe made in threats his fierce reply:\"Hear Maithil lady, hear my speech:List to my words and ponder each.If o\\'er thy head twelve months shall flyAnd thou thy love wilt still deny,My cooks shall mince thy flesh with steelAnd serve it for my morning meal.\"Thus with terrific threats to herSpake Rávan, cruel ravener.Mad with the rage her answer wokeHe called the fiendish train and spoke:\"Take her, ye Rákshas dames, who frightWith hideous form and mien the sight,Who make the flesh of men your food,--And let her pride be soon subdued.\"He spoke, and at his word the bandOf fiendish monsters raised each handIn reverence to the giant king,And pressed round Sítá in a ring.Rávan once more with stern behestTo those she-fiends his speech addressed:Shaking the earth beneath his tread,He stamped his furious foot and said:\"To the Asoka garden bearThe dame, and guard her safely thereUntil her stubborn pride be bentBy mingled threat and blandishment.See that ye watch her well, and tame,Like some she-elephant, the dame.\"They led her to that garden whereThe sweetest flowers perfumed the air,Where bright trees bore each rarest fruit,And birds, enamoured, ne\\'er were mute.Bowed down with terror and distress,Watched by each cruel giantess,--Like a poor solitary deerWhen ravening tigresses are near,--The hapless lady lay distraughtLike some wild thing but newly caught,And found no solace, no reliefFrom agonizing fear and grief;Not for one moment could forgetEach terrifying word and threat,Or the fierce eyes upon her setBy those who watched around.She thought of Ráma far away,She mourned for Lakshman as she layIn grief and terror and dismayHalf fainting on the ground.Canto LVII. Sítá Comforted.Soon as the fiend had set her downWithin his home in Lanká townTriumph and joy filled Indra breast,Whom thus the Eternal Sire addressed:\"This deed will free the worlds from woeAnd cause the giants\\' overthrow.The fiend has borne to Lanká isleThe lady of the lovely smile,True consort born to happy fateWith features fair and delicate.She looks and longs for Ráma face,But sees a crowd of demon race,And guarded by the giant trainPines for her lord and weeps in vain.But Lanká founded on a steepIs girdled by the mighty deep,And how will Ráma know his fairAnd blameless wife is prisoned there?She on her woe will sadly broodAnd pine away in solitude,And heedless of herself, will ceaseTo live, despairing of release.Yes, pondering on her fate, I seeHer gentle life in jeopardy.Go, Indra, swiftly seek the place,And look upon her lovely face.Within the city make thy way:Let heavenly food her spirit stay.\"Thus Brahma spake: and He who slewThe cruel demon Páka, flewWhere Lanká royal city lay,And Sleep went with him on his way.\"Sleep,\" cried the heavenly Monarch, \"closeEach giant eye in deep repose.\"Thus Indra spoke, and Sleep fulfilledWith joy his mandate, as he willed,To aid the plan the Gods proposed,The demons\\' eyes in sleep she closed.Then Sachí lord, the Thousand-eyed,To the Asoka garden hied.He came and stood where Sítá lay,And gently thus began to say:\"Lord of the Gods who hold the sky,Dame of the lovely smile, am I.Weep no more, lady, weep no more;Thy days of woe will soon be o\\'er.I come, O Janak child, to beThe helper of thy lord and thee.He through my grace, with hosts to aid,This sea-girt land will soon invade.\\'Tis by my art that slumbers closeThe eyelids of thy giant foes.Now I, with Sleep, this place have sought,Videhan lady, and have broughtA gift of heaven ambrosial foodTo stay thee in thy solitude.Receive it from my hand, and taste,O lady of the dainty waist:For countless ages thou shall beFrom pangs of thirst and hunger free.\"But doubt within her bosom wokeAs to the Lord of Gods she spoke:\"How may I know for truth that thouWhose form I see before me nowArt verily the King adoredBy heavenly Gods, and Sachí lord?With Raghu sons I learnt to knowThe certain signs which Godhead show.These marks before mine eyes displayIf o\\'er the Gods thou bear the sway.\"The heavenly lord of Sachí heard,And did according to her word.Above the ground his feet were raised;With eyelids motionless he gazed.No dust upon his raiment lay,And his bright wreath was fresh and gay.Nor was the lady glad heart slowThe Monarch of the Gods to know,And while the tears unceasing ranFrom her sweet eyes she thus began:\"My lord has gained a friend in thee,And I this day thy presence seeShown clearly to mine eyes, as whenRáma and Lakshman, lords of men,Beheld it, and their sire the king,And Janak too from whom I spring.Now I, O Monarch of the Blest,Will eat this food at thy behest,Which thou hast brought me, of thy grace,To aid and strengthen Raghu race.\"She spoke, and by his words relieved,The food from Indra hand received,Yet ere she ate the balm he brought,On Lakshman and her lord she thought.\"If my brave lord be still alive,If valiant Lakshman yet survive,May this my taste of heavenly foodBring health to them and bliss renewed!\"She ate, and that celestial foodStayed hunger, thirst, and lassitude,And all her strength restored.Great joy her hopeful spirit stirredAt the glad tidings newly heardOf Lakshman and her lord.And Indra heart was joyful too:He bade the Maithil dame adieu,His saving errand done.With Sleep beside him parting thenceHe sought his heavenly residenceTo prosper Raghu son.Canto LVIII. The Brothers\\' Meeting.When Ráma deadly shaft had struckThe giant in the seeming buck,The chieftain turned him from the placeHis homeward way again to trace.Then as he hastened onward, fainTo look upon his spouse again,Behind him from a thicket nighRang out a jackal piercing cry.Alarmed he heard the startling shriekThat raised his hair and dimmed his cheek,And all his heart was filled with doubtAs the shrill jackal cry rang out:\"Alas, some dire disaster seemsPortended by the jackal screams.O may the Maithil dame be screenedFrom outrage of each hungry fiend!Alas, if Lakshman chanced to hearThat bitter cry of woe and fearWhat time Márícha, as he died,With voice that mocked my accents cried,Swift to my side the prince would fleeAnd quit the dame to succour me.Too well I see the demon bandThe slaughter of my love have planned.Me far from home and Sítá viewThe seeming deer Márícha drew.He led me far through brake and dellTill wounded by my shaft he fell,And as he sank rang out his cry,\"O save me, Lakshman, or I die.\"May it be well with both who stayedIn the great wood with none to aid,For every fiend is now my foeFor Janasthán great overthrow,And many an omen seen to-dayHas filled my heart with sore dismay.\"Such were the thoughts and sad surmiseOf Ráma at the jackal cries,And all his heart within him burnedAs to his cot his steps he turned.He pondered on the deer that ledHis feet to follow where it fled,And sad with many a bitter thoughtHis home in Janasthán he sought.His soul was dark with woe and fearWhen flocks of birds and troops of deerMove round him from the left, and raisedDiscordant voices as they gazed.The omens which the chieftain viewedThe terror of his soul renewed,When lo, to meet him Lakshman spedWith brows whence all the light had fled.Near and more near the princes came,Each brother heart and look the same;Alike on each sad visage layThe signs of misery and dismay,Then Ráma by his terror movedHis brother for his fault reprovedIn leaving Sítá far from aidIn the wild wood where giants strayed.Lakshman left hand he took, and thenIn gentle tones the prince of men,Though sharp and fierce their tenour ran,Thus to his brother chief began:\"O Lakshman, thou art much to blameLeaving alone the Maithil dame,And flying hither to my side:O, may no ill my spouse betide!But ah, I know my wife is dead,And giants on her limbs have fed,So strange, so terrible are allThe omens which my heart appal.O Lakshman, may we yet returnThe safety of my love to learn.To find the child of Janak stillAlive and free from scathe and ill!Each bird with notes of warning screams,Though the hot sun still darts his beams.The moan of deer, the jackal yellOf some o\\'erwhelming misery tell.O mighty brother, still may she,My princess, live from danger free!That semblance of a golden deerAllured me far away,I followed nearer and more near,And longed to take the prey.I followed where the quarry fled:My deadly arrow flew,And as the dying creature bled,The giant met my view.Great fear and pain oppress my heartThat dreads the coming blow,And through my left eye keenly dartThe throbs that herald woe.Ah Lakshman, all these signs dismay,My soul that sinks with dread,I know my love is torn away,Or, haply, she is dead.\"Canto LIX. Ráma Return.When Ráma saw his brother standWith none beside him, all unmanned,Eager he questioned why he cameSo far without the Maithil dame:\"Where is my wife, my darling, sheWho to the wild wood followed me?Where hast thou left my lady, whereThe dame who chose my lot to share?Where is my love who balms my woeAs through the forest wilds I go,Unkinged and banished and disgraced,--My darling of the dainty waist?She nerves my spirit for the strife,She, only she gives zest to life,Dear as my breath is she who viesIn charms with daughters of the skies.If Janak child be mine no more,In splendour fair as virgin ore,The lordship of the skies and earthTo me were prize of little worth.Ah, lives she yet, the Maithil dame,Dear as the soul within this frame?O, let not all my toil be vain,The banishment, the woe and pain!O, let not dark Kaikeyí winThe guerdon of her treacherous sin,If, Sítá lost, my days I end,And thou without me homeward wend!O, let not good Kausalyá shedHer bitter tears to mourn me dead,Nor her proud rival hest obey,Strong in her son and queenly sway!Back to my cot will I repairIf Sítá live to greet me there,But if my wife have perished, IReft of my love will surely die.O Lakshman, if I seek my cot,Look for my love and find her notSweet welcome with her smile to give,I tell thee, I will cease to live.O answer,--let thy words be plain,--Lives Sítá yet, or is she slain?Didst thou thy sacred trust betrayTill ravening giants seized the prey?Ah me, so young, so soft and fair,Lapped in all bliss, untried by care,Rent from her own dear husband, howWill she support her misery now?That voice, O Lakshman smote thine ear,And filled, I ween, thy heart with fear,When on thy name for succour criedThe treacherous giant ere he died.That voice too like mine own, I ween,Was heard by the Videhan queen.She bade thee seek my side to aid,And quickly was the hest obeyed,But ah, thy fault I needs must blame,To leave alone the helpless dame,And let the cruel giants sateThe fury of their murderous hate.Those blood-devouring demons allGrieve in their souls for Khara fall,And Sítá, none to guard her side,Torn by their cruel hands has died.I sink, O tamer of thy foes,Deep in the sea of whelming woes.What can I now? I must endureThe mighty grief that mocks at cure.\"Thus, all his thoughts on Sítá bent,To Janasthán the chieftain went,Hastening on with eager stride,And Lakshman hurried by his side.With toil and thirst and hunger worn,His breast with doubt and anguish torn,He sought the well-known spot.Again, again he turned to chideWith quivering lips which terror dried:He looked, and found her not.Within his leafy home he sped,Each pleasant spot he visitedWhere oft his darling strayed.\"\\'Tis as I feared,\" he cried, and there,Yielding to pangs too great to bear,He sank by grief dismayed.Canto LX. Lakshman Reproved.But Ráma ceased not to upbraid,His brother for untimely aid,And thus, while anguish wrung his breast,The chief with eager question pressed:\"Why, Lakshman, didst thou hurry henceAnd leave my wife without defence?I left her in the wood with thee,And deemed her safe from jeopardy.When first thy form appeared in view,I marked that Sítá came not too.With woe my troubled soul was rent,Prophetic of the dire event.Thy coming steps afar I spied,I saw no Sítá by thy side,And felt a sudden throbbing dartThrough my left eye, and arm, and heart.\"Lakshman, with Fortune marks impressed,His brother mournfully addressed:\"Not by my heart free impulse led,Leaving thy wife to thee I sped;But by her keen reproaches sent,O Ráma, to thine aid I went.She heard afar a mournful cry,\"O save me, Lakshman, or I die.\"The voice that spoke in moving toneSmote on her ear and seemed thine own.Soon as those accents reached her earShe yielded to her woe and fear,She wept o\\'ercome by grief, and cried,\"Fly, Lakshman, fly to Ráma side.\"Though many a time she bade me speed,Her urgent prayer I would not heed.I bade her in thy strength confide,And thus with tender words replied:\"No giant roams the forest shadeFrom whom thy lord need shrink dismayed.No human voice, believe me, spokeThose words thy causeless fear that woke.Can he whose might can save in woeThe heavenly Gods e\\'er stoop so low,And with those piteous accents callFor succour like a caitiff thrall?And why should wandering giants chooseThe accents of thy lord to use,In alien tones my help to crave,And cry aloud, O Lakshman, save?Now let my words thy spirit cheer,Compose thy thoughts and banish fear.In hell, in earth, or in the skiesThere is not, and there cannot riseA champion whose strong arm can slayThy Ráma in the battle fray.To heavenly hosts he ne\\'er would yieldThough Indra led them to the field.\"To soothe her thus I vainly sought:Her heart with woe was still distraught.While from her eyes the waters ranHer bitter speech she thus began:\"Too well I see thy dark intent:Thy lawless thoughts on me are bent.Thou hopest, but thy hope is vain,To win my love, thy brother slain.Not love, but Bharat dark decreeTo share his exile counselled thee,Or hearing now his bitter cryThou surely to his aid wouldst fly.For love of me, a stealthy foeThou choosest by his side to go,And now thou longest that my lordShould die, and wilt no help afford.\"Such were the words the lady said:With angry fire my eyes were red.With pale lips quivering in my rageI hastened from the hermitage.\"He ceased; and frenzied by his painThe son of Raghu spoke again:\"O brother, for thy fault I grieve,The Maithil dame alone to leave.Thou knowest that my arm is strongTo save me from the giant throng,And yet couldst leave the cottage, spurredTo folly by her angry word.For this thy deed I praise thee not,--To leave her helpless in the cot,And thus thy sacred charge forsakeFor the wild words a woman spake.Yea thou art all to blame herein,And very grievous is thy sin.That anger swayed thy faithless breastAnd made thee false to my behest.An arrow speeding from my bowHas laid the treacherous giant low,Who lured me eager for the chaseFar from my hermit dwelling-place.The string with easy hand I drew,The arrow as in pastime flew,The wounded quarry bled.The borrowed form was cast away,Before mine eye a giant layWith bright gold braceleted.My arrow smote him in the chest:The giant by the pain distressedRaised his loud voice on high.Far rang the mournful sound: mine own,It seemed, were accent, voice, and tone,They made thee leave my spouse aloneAnd to my rescue fly.\"Canto LXI. Ráma Lament.As Ráma sought his leafy cotThrough his left eye keen throbbings shot,His wonted strength his frame forsook,And all his body reeled and shook.Still on those dreadful signs he thought,--Sad omens with disaster fraught,And from his troubled heart he cried,\"O, may no ill my spouse betide!\"Longing to gaze on Sítá faceHe hastened to his dwelling-place,Then sinking neath his misery weight,He looked and found it desolate.Tossing his mighty arms on highHe sought her with an eager cry,From spot to spot he wildly ranEach corner of his home to scan.He looked, but Sítá was not there;His cot was disolate and bare,Like streamlet in the winter frost,The glory of her lilies lost.With leafy tears the sad trees weptAs a wild wind their branches swept.Mourned bird and deer, and every flowerDrooped fainting round the lonely bower.The silvan deities had fledThe spot where all the light was dead,Where hermit coats of skin displayed,And piles of sacred grass were laid.He saw, and maddened by his painCried in lament again, again:\"Where is she, dead or torn away,Lost, or some hungry giant prey?Or did my darling chance to roveFor fruit and blossoms though the grove?Or has she sought the pool or rill,Her pitcher from the wave to fill?\"His eager eyes on fire with painHe roamed about with maddened brain.Each grove and glade he searched with care,He sought, but found no Sítá there.He wildly rushed from hill to hill;From tree to tree, from rill to rill,As bitter woe his bosom rentStill Ráma roamed with fond lament:\"O sweet Kadamba say has sheWho loved thy bloom been seen by thee?If thou have seen her face most fair,Say, gentle tree, I pray thee, where.O Bel tree with thy golden fruitRound as her breast, no more be mute,Where is my radiant darling, gayIn silk that mocks thy glossy spray?O Arjun, say, where is she nowWho loved to touch thy scented bough?Do not thy graceful friend forget,But tell me, is she living yet?Speak, Basil, thou must surely know,For like her limbs thy branches show,--Most lovely in thy fair arrayOf twining plant and tender spray.Sweet Tila, fairest of the trees,Melodious with the hum of bees,Where is my darling Sítá, tell,--The dame who loved thy flowers so well?Asoka, act thy gentle part,--Named Heartsease,(507) give me what thou art,To these sad eyes my darling showAnd free me from this load of woe.O Palm, in rich ripe fruitage dressedRound as the beauties of her breast,If thou have heart to know and feel,My peerless consort fate reveal.Hast thou, Rose-apple, chanced to viewMy darling bright with golden hue?If thou have seen her quickly speak,Where is the dame I wildly seek?O glorious Cassia, thou art gayWith all thy loveliest bloom to-day,Where is my dear who loved to holdIn her full lap thy flowery gold?\"To many a tree and plant beside,To Jasmin, Mango, Sál, he cried.\"Say, hast thou seen, O gentle deer,The fawn-eyed Sítá wandering here?It may be that my love has strayedTo sport with fawns beneath the shade,If thou, great elephant, have seenMy darling of the lovely mien,Whose rounded limbs are soft and fineAs is that lissome trunk of thine,O noblest of wild creatures, showWhere is the dame thou needs must know.O tiger, hast thou chanced to seeMy darling? very fair is she,Cast all thy fear away, declare,Where is my moon-faced darling, where?There, darling of the lotus eye,I see thee, and \\'tis vain to fly,Wilt thou not speak, dear love? I seeThy form half hidden by the tree.Stay if thou love me, Sítá, stayIn pity cease thy heartless play.Why mock me now? thy gentle breastWas never prone to cruel jest.\\'Tis vain behind yon bush to steal:Thy shimmering silks thy path reveal.Fly not, mine eyes pursue thy way;For pity sake, dear Sítá, stay.Ah me, ah me, my words are vain;My gentle love is lost or slain.How could her tender bosom spurnHer husband on his home-return?Ah no, my love is surely dead,Fierce giants on her flesh have fed,Rending the soft limbs of their preyWhen I her lord was far away.That moon-bright face, that polished brow,Red lips, bright teeth--what are they now?Alas, my darling shapely neckShe loved with chains of gold to deck,--That neck that mocked the sandal scent,The ruthless fiends have grasped and rent.Alas, \\'twas vain those arms to raiseSoft as the young tree tender sprays.Ah, dainty meal for giants\\' lipsWere arms and quivering finger tips.Ah, she who counted many a friendWas left for fiends to seize and rend,Was left by me without defenceFrom ravening giants\\' violence.O Lakshman of the arm of might,Say, is my darling love in sight?O dearest Sítá. where art thou?Where is my darling consort now?\"Thus as he cried in wild lamentFrom grove to grove the mourner went,Here for a moment sank to rest,Then started up and onward pressed.Thus roaming on like one distraughtStill for his vanished love he sought,He searched in wood and hill and glade,By rock and brook and wild cascade.Through groves with restless step he spedAnd left no spot unvisited.Through lawns and woods of vast extentStill searching for his love he wentWith eager steps and fast.For many a weary hour he toiled,Still in his fond endeavour foiled,Yet hoping to the last.Canto LXII. Ráma Lament.When all the toil and search was vainHe sought his leafy home again.\\'Twas empty still: all scattered layThe seats of grass in disarray.He raised his shapely arms on highAnd spoke aloud with bitter cry:\"Where is the Maithil dame?\" he said,\"O, whither has my darling fled?Who can have borne away my dame,Or feasted on her tender frame?If, Sítá hidden by some tree,Thou joyest still to mock at me,Cease, cease thy cruel sport, and takeCompassion, or my heart will break.Bethink thee, love, the gentle fawnsWith whom thou playest on the lawns,Impatient for thy coming waitWith streaming eyes disconsolate.Reft of my love, I needs must goHence to the shades weighed down by woe.The king our sire will see me there,And cry, \"O perjured Ráma, where,Where is thy faith, that thou canst speedFrom exile ere the time decreed?\"Ah Sítá, whither hast thou fledAnd left me here disquieted,A hapless mourner, reft of hope,Too feeble with my woe to cope?E\\'en thus indignant Glory fliesThe wretch who stains his soul with lies.If thou, my love, art lost to view,I in my woe must perish too.\"Thus Ráma by his grief distraughtWept for the wife he vainly sought,And Lakshman whose fraternal breastLonged for his weal, the chief addressedWhose soul gave way beneath the painWhen all his eager search was vain,Like some great elephant who standsSinking upon the treacherous sands:\"Not yet, O wisest chief, despair;Renew thy toil with utmost care.This noble hill where trees are greenHas many a cave and dark ravine.The Maithil lady day by dayDelighted in the woods to stray,Deep in the grove she wanders still,Or walks by blossom-covered rill,Or fish-loved river stealing throughTall clusters of the dark bamboo.Or else the dame with arch designTo prove thy mood, O Prince, and mine,Far in some sheltering thicket liesTo frighten ere she meet our eyes.Then come, renew thy labour, traceThe lady to her lurking-place,And search the wood from side to sideTo know where Sítá loves to bide.Collect thy thoughts, O royal chief,Nor yield to unavailing grief.\"Thus Lakshman, by attention stirred,To fresh attempts his brother spurred,And Ráma, as he ceased, beganWith Lakshman aid each spot to scan.In eager search their way they tookThrough wood, o\\'er hill, by pool and brook,They roamed each mount, nor spared to seekOn ridge and crag and towering peak.They sought the dame in every spot;But all in vain; they found her not.Above, below, on every sideThey ranged the hill, and Ráma cried,\"O Lakshman, O my brother stillNo trace of Sítá on the hill!\"Then Lakshman as he roamed the woodBeside his glorious brother stood,And while fierce grief his bosom burnedThis answer to the chief returned:\"Thou, Ráma, after toil and painWilt meet the Maithil dame again,As Vishnu, Bali might subdued,His empire of the earth renewed.\"(508)Then Ráma cried in mournful tone,His spirit by his woe o\\'erthrown;\"The wood is searched from side to side,No distant spot remains untried,No lilied pool, no streamlet whereThe lotus buds are fresh and fair.Our eyes have searched the hill with allHis caves and every waterfall,--But ah, not yet I find my wife,More precious than the breath of life.\"As thus he mourned his vanished dameA mighty trembling seized his frame,And by o\\'erpowering grief assailed,His troubled senses reeled and failed.Too great to bear his misery grew,And many a long hot sigh he drew,Then as he wept and sobbed and sighed,\"O Sítá, O my love!\" he cried.Then Lakshman, joining palm to palm,Tried every art his woe to calm.But Ráma in his anguish heardOr heeded not one soothing word,Still for his spouse he mourned, and shrillRang out his lamentation still.Canto LXIII. Ráma Lament.Thus for his wife in vain he sought:Then, his sad soul with pain distraught,The hero of the lotus eyesFilled all the air with frantic cries.O\\'erpowered by love strong influence, heHis absent wife still seemed to see,And thus with accents weak and faintRenewed with tears his wild complaint:\"Thou, fairer than their bloom, my spouse,Art hidden by Asoka boughs.Those blooms have power to banish care,But now they drive me to despair.Thine arms are like the plantain stem:Why let the plantain cover them?Thou art not hidden, love; thy feetBetray thee in thy dark retreat.Thou runnest in thy girlish sportTo flowery trees, thy dear resort.But cease, O cease, my love, I pray,To vex me with thy cruel play.Such mockery in a holy spotWhere hermits dwell beseems thee not.Ah, now I see thy fickle mindTo scornful mood too much inclined,Come, large-eyed beauty, I implore;Lone is the cot so dear before.No, she is slain by giants; theyHave stolen or devoured their prey,Or surely at my mournful cryMy darling to her lord would fly.O Lakshman, see those troops of deer:In each sad eye there gleams a tear.Those looks of woe too clearly sayMy consort is the giants\\' prey.O noblest, fairest of the fair,Where art thou, best of women, where?This day will dark Kaikeyí findFresh triumph for her evil mind,When I, who with my Sítá cameReturn alone, without my dame.But ne\\'er can I return to seeThose chambers where my queen should beAnd hear the scornful people speakOf Ráma as a coward weak.For mine will be the coward shameWho let the foeman steal his dame.How can I seek my home, or brookUpon Videha king to look?How listen, when he bids me tell,My wanderings o\\'er, that all is well?He, when I meet his eager view,Will mark that Sítá comes not too,And when he hears the mournful taleHis wildered sense will reel and fail.\"O Dasaratha\" will he cry,\"Blest in thy mansion in the sky!\"Ne\\'er to that town my steps shall bend,That town which Bharat arms defend,For e\\'en the blessed homes aboveWould seem a waste without my love.Leave me, my brother, here, I pray;To fair Ayodhyá bend thy way.Without my love I cannot bearTo live one hour in blank despair.Round Bharat neck thy fond arms twine,And greet him with these words of mine:\"Dear brother, still the power retain,And o\\'er the land as monarch reign.\"With salutation next inclineBefore thy mother, his, and mine.Still, brother, to my words attend,And with all care each dame befriend.To my dear mother ear relateMy mournful tale and Sítá fate.\"Thus Ráma gave his sorrow vent,And from a heart which anguish rent,Mourned for his wife in loud lament,--Her of the glorious hair,From Lakshman cheek the colour fled,And o\\'er his heart came sudden dread,Sick, faint, and sore disquietedBy woe too great to bear.Canto LXIV. Ráma Lament.Reft of his love, the royal chief,Weighed down beneath his whelming grief,Desponding made his brother shareHis grievous burden of despair.Over his sinking bosom rolledThe flood of sorrow uncontrolled.And as he wept and sighed,In mournful accents faint and slowWith words congenial to his woe,To Lakshman thus he cried:\"Brother, I ween, beneath the sun,Of all mankind there lives not oneSo full of sin, whose hand has doneSuch cursed deeds as mine.For my sad heart with misery bleeds,As, guerdon of those evil deeds,Still greater woe to woe succeedsIn never-ending line.A life of sin I freely chose,And from my past transgression flowsA ceaseless flood of bitter woesMy folly to repay.The fruit of sin has ripened fast,Through many a sorrow have I passed,And now the crowning grief at lastFalls on my head to-day.From all my faithful friends I fled,My sire is numbered with the dead,My royal rank is forfeited,My mother far away.These woes on which I sadly thinkFill, till it raves above the brink,The stream of grief in which I sink,--The flood which naught can stay.Ne\\'er, brother, ne\\'er have I complained;Though long by toil and trouble pained,Without a murmur I sustainedThe woes of woodland life.But fiercer than the flames that riseWhen crackling wood the food supplies,--Flashing a glow through evening skies,--This sorrow for my wife.Some cruel fiend has seized the preyAnd torn my trembling love away,While, as he bore her through the skies,She shrieked aloud with frantic cries,In tones of fear which, wild and shrill,Retained their native sweetness still.Ah me, that breast so soft and sweet,For sandal precious perfume meet,Now all detained with dust and gore,Shall meet my fond caress no more.That face, whose lips with tones so clearMade pleasant music, sweet to hear,--With soft locks plaited o\\'er the brow,--Some giant hand is on it now.It smiles not, as the dear light failsWhen Ráhu jaw the moon assails.Ah, my true love! that shapely neckShe loved with fairest chains to deck,The cruel demons rend, and drainThe lifeblood from each mangled vein.Ah, when the savage monsters cameAnd dragged away the helpless dame,The lady of the long soft eyeCalled like a lamb with piteous cry.Beneath this rock, O Lakshman, see,My peerless consort sat with me,And gently talked to thee the while,Her sweet lips opening with a smile.Here is that fairest stream which sheLoved ever, bright Godávarí.Ne\\'er can the dame have passed this way:So far alone she would not stray,Nor has my darling, lotus-eyed,Sought lilies by the river side,For without me she ne\\'er would goTo streamlets where the wild flowers grow,Tell me not, brother, she has strayedTo the dark forest distant shadeWhere blooming boughs are gay and sweet,And bright birds love the cool retreat.Alone my love would never dare,--My timid love,--to wander there.O Lord of Day whose eye sees allWe act and plan, on thee I call:For naught is hidden from thy sight,--Great witness thou of wrong and right.Where is she, lost or torn away?Dispel my torturing doubt and say.And O thou Wind who blowest free,The worlds have naught concealed from thee.List to my prayer, reveal one traceOf her, the glory of her race.Say, is she stolen hence, or dead,Or do her feet the forest tread?\"Thus with disordered senses, faintWith woe he poured his sad complaint,And then, a better way to teach,Wise Lakshman spoke in seemly speech:\"Up, brother dear, thy grief subdue,With heart and soul thy search renew.When woes oppress and dangers threatBrave effort ne\\'er was fruitless yet.\"He spoke, but Ráma gave no heedTo valiant Lakshman prudent rede.With double force the flood of painRushed o\\'er his yielding soul again.Canto LXV. Ráma Wrath.With piteous voice, by woe subdued,Thus Raghu son his speech renewed:\"Thy steps, my brother, quickly turnTo bright Godávarí and learnIf Sítá to the stream have hiedTo cull the lilies on its side.\"Obedient to the words he said,His brother to the river sped.The shelving banks he searched in vain,And then to Ráma turned again.\"I searched, but found her not,\" he cried;\"I called aloud, but none replied.Where can the Maithil lady stray,Whose sight would chase our cares away?I know not where, her steps untraced,Roams Sítá of the dainty waist.\"When Ráma heard the words he spokeAgain he sank beneath the stroke,And with a bosom anguish-fraughtHimself the lovely river sought.There standing on the shelving side,\"O Sítá, where art thou?\" he cried.No spirit voice an answer gave,No murmur from the trembling waveOf sweet Godávarí declaredThe outrage which the fiend had dared.\"O speak!\" the pitying spirits cried,But yet the stream their prayer denied,Nor dared she, coldly mute, relateTo the sad chief his darling fateOf Rávan awful form she thought,And the dire deed his arm had wrought,And still withheld by fear dismayed,The tale for which the mourner prayed.When hope was none, his heart to cheer,That the bright stream his cry would hearWhile sorrow for his darling toreHis longing soul he spake once more:\"Though I have sought with tears and sighsGodárvarí no word replies,O say, what answer can I frameTo Janak, father of my dame?Or how before her mother standLeading no Sítá by the hand?Where is my loyal love who wentForth with her lord to banishment?Her faith to me she nobly heldThough from my realm and home expelled,--A hermit, nursed on woodland fare,--She followed still and soothed my care.Of all my friends am I bereft,Nor is my faithful consort left.How slowly will the long nights creepWhile comfortless I wake and weep!O, if my wife may yet be found,With humble love I\\'ll wander roundThis Janasthán, Prasravan hill,Mandákiní delightful rill.See how the deer with gentle eyesLook on my face and sympathize.I mark their soft expression: eachWould soothe me, if it could, with speech.\"A while the anxious throng he eyed.And \"Where is Sítá, where?\" he cried.Thus while hot tears his utterance brokeThe mourning son of Raghu spoke.The deer in pity for his woesObeyed the summons and arose.Upon his right thy stood, and raisedTheir sad eyes up to heaven and gazedEach to that quarter bent her lookWhich Rávan with his captive took.Then Raghu son again they viewed,And toward that point their way pursued.Then Lakshman watched their looks intentAs moaning on their way they went,And marked each sign which struck his senseWith mute expressive influence,Then as again his sorrow wokeThus to his brother chief he spoke:\"Those deer thy eager question heardAnd rose at once by pity stirred:See, in thy search their aid they lend,See, to the south their looks they bend.Arise, dear brother, let us goThe way their eager glances show,If haply sign or trace descriedOur footsteps in the search may guide.\"The son of Raghu gave assent,And quickly to the south they went;With eager eyes the earth he scanned,And Lakshman followed close at hand.As each to other spake his thought,And round with anxious glances sought,Scattered before them in the way,Blooms of a fallen garland lay.When Ráma saw that flowery rainHe spoke once more with bitterest pain:\"O Lakshman every flower that liesHere on the ground I recognize.I culled them in the grove, and thereMy darling twined them in her hair.The sun, the earth, the genial breezeHave spared these flowers my soul to please.\"Then to that woody hill he prayed,Whence flashed afar each wild cascade:\"O best of mountains, hast thou seenA dame of perfect form and mienIn some sweet spot with trees o\\'ergrown,--My darling whom I left alone?\"Then as a lion threats a deerHe thundered with a voice of fear:\"Reveal her, mountain, to my viewWith golden limbs and golden hue.Where is my darling Sítá? speakBefore I rend thee peak from peak.\"The mountain seemed her track to show,But told not all he sought to know.Then Dasaratha son renewedHis summons as the mount he viewed:\"Soon as my flaming arrows fly,Consumed to ashes shall thou lieWithout a herb or bud or tree,And birds no more shall dwell in thee.And if this stream my prayer deny,My wrath this day her flood shall dry,Because she lends no aid to traceMy darling of the lotus face.\"Thus Ráma spake as though his ireWould scorch them with his glance of fire;Then searching farther on the groundThe footprint of a fiend he found,And small light traces here and there,Where Sítá in her great despair,Shrieking for Ráma help, had fledBefore the giant mighty tread.His careful eye each trace surveyedWhich Sítá and the fiend had made,--The quivers and the broken bowAnd ruined chariot of the foe,--And told, distraught by fear and grief,His tidings to his brother chief:\"O Lakshman, here,\" he cried \"beholdMy Sítá earrings dropped with gold.Here lie her garlands torn and rent,Here lies each glittering ornament.O look, the ground on every sideWith blood-like drops of gold is dyed.The fiends who wear each strange disguiseHave seized, I ween, the helpless prize.My lady, by their hands o\\'erpowered,Is slaughtered, mangled, and devoured.Methinks two fearful giants cameAnd waged fierce battle for the dame.Whose, Lakshman, was this mighty bowWith pearls and gems in glittering row?Cast to the ground the fragments lie,And still their glory charms the eye.A bow so mighty sure was plannedFor heavenly God or giant hand.Whose was this coat of golden mailWhich, though its lustre now is pale,Shone like the sun of morning, brightWith studs of glittering lazulite?Whose, Lakshman, was this bloom-wreathed shadeWith all its hundred ribs displayed?This screen, most meet for royal brow,With broken staff lies useless now.And these tall asses, goblin-faced,With plates of golden harness graced,Whose hideous forms are stained with goreWho is the lord whose yoke they bore?Whose was this pierced and broken carThat shoots a flame-like blaze afar?Whose these spent shafts at random spread,Each fearful with its iron head,--With golden mountings fair to see,Long as a chariot axle-tree?These quivers see, which, rent in twain,Their sheaves of arrows still contain.Whose was this driver? Dead and cold,His hands the whip and reins still hold.See, Lakshman, here the foot I traceOf man, nay, one of giant race.The hatred that I nursed of oldGrows mightier now a hundred foldAgainst these giants, fierce of heart,Who change their forms by magic art.Slain, eaten by the giant press,Or stolen is the votaress,Nor could her virtue bring defenceTo Sítá seized and hurried hence.O, if my love be slain or lostAll hope of bliss for me is crossed.The power of all the worlds were vainTo bring one joy to soothe my pain.The spirits with their blinded eyesWould look in wonder, and despiseThe Lord who made the worlds, the greatCreator when compassionate.And so, I ween, the Immortals turnCold eyes upon me now, and spurnThe weakling prompt at pity call,Devoted to the good of all.But from this day behold me changed,From every gentle grace estranged.Now be it mine all life to slay,And sweep these cursed fiends away.As the great sun leaps up the sky,And the cold moonbeams fade and die,So vengeance rises in my breast,One passion conquering all the rest.Gandharvas in their radiant place,The Yakshas, and the giant race,Kinnars and men shall look in vainFor joy they ne\\'er shall see again.The anguish of my great despair,O Lakshman, fills the heaven and air;And I in wrath all life will slayWithin the triple world to-day.Unless the Gods in heaven who dwellRestore my Sítá safe and well,I armed with all the fires of Fate,The triple world will devastate.The troubled stars from heaven shall fall,The moon be wrapped in gloomy pall,The fire be quenched, the wind be stilled,The radiant sun grow dark and chilled;Crushed every mountain towering pride,And every lake and river dried,Dead every creeper, plant, and tree,And lost for aye the mighty sea.Thou shalt the world this day beholdIn wild disorder uncontrolled,With dying life which naught defendsFrom the fierce storm my bowstring sends.My shafts this day, for Sítá sake,The life of every fiend shall take.The Gods this day shall see the forceThat wings my arrows on their course,And mark how far that course is held,By my unsparing wrath impelled.No God, not one of Daitya strain,Goblin or Rákshas shall remain.My wrath shall end the worlds, and allDemons and Gods therewith shall fall.Each world which Gods, the Dánav race,And giants make their dwelling place,Shall fall beneath my arrows sentIn fury when my bow is bent.The arrows loosened from my stringConfusion on the worlds shall bring.For she is lost or breathes no more,Nor will the Gods my love restore.Hence all on earth with life and breathThis day I dedicate to death.All, till my darling they reveal,The fury of my shafts shall feel.\"Thus as he spake by rage impelled,Red grew his eyes, his fierce lips swelled.His bark coat round his form he drewAnd coiled his hermit braids anew,Like Rudra when he yearned to slayThe demon Tripur(509) in the fray.So looked the hero brave and wise,The fury flashing from his eyes.Then Ráma, conqueror of the foe,From Lakshman hand received his bow,Strained the great string, and laid thereonA deadly dart that flashed and shone,And spake these words as fierce in ireAs He who ends the worlds with fire:\"As age and time and death and fateAll life with checkless power await,So Lakshman in my wrath to-dayMy vengeful might shall brook no stay,Unless this day I see my dameIn whose sweet form is naught to blame,--Yea, as before, my love beholdFair with bright teeth and perfect mould,This world shall feel a deadly blowDestroyed with ruthless overthrow,And serpent lords and Gods of air,Gandharvas, men, the doom shall share.\"Canto LXVI. Lakshman Speech.He stood incensed with eyes of flame,Still mourning for his ravished dame,Determined, like the fire of Fate,To leave the wide world desolate.His ready bow the hero eyed,And as again, again he sighed,The triple world would fain consumeLike Hara(510) in the day of doom.Then Lakshman moved with sorrow viewedHis brother in unwonted mood,And reverent palm to palm applied,Thus spoke with lips which terror dried\"Thy heart was ever soft and kind,To every creature good inclined.Cast not thy tender mood away,Nor yield to anger mastering sway.The moon for gentle grace is known,The sun has splendour all his own,The restless wind is free and fast,And earth in patience unsurpassed.So glory with her noble fruitIs thine eternal attribute.O, let not, for the sin of one,The triple world be all undone.I know not whose this car that liesIn fragments here before our eyes,Nor who the chiefs who met and fought,Nor what the prize the foemen sought;Who marked the ground with hoof and wheel,Or whose the hand that plied the steelWhich left this spot, the battle o\\'er,Thus sadly dyed with drops of gore.Searching with utmost care I viewThe signs of one and not of two.Where\\'er I turn mine eyes I traceNo mighty host about the place.Then mete not out for one offenceThis all-involving recompense.For kings should use the sword they bear,But mild in time should learn to spare,Thou, ever moved by misery call,Wast the great hope and stay of all.Throughout this world who would not blameThis outrage on thy ravished dame?Gandharvas, Dánavs, Gods, the trees,The rocks, the rivers, and the seas,Can ne\\'er in aught thy soul offend,As one whom holiest rites befriend.But him who dared to steal the damePursue, O King, with ceaseless aim,With me, the hermits\\' holy band,And thy great bow to arm thy handBy every mighty flood we\\'ll seek,Each wood, each hill from base to peak.To the fair homes of Gods we\\'ll fly,And bright Gandharvas in the sky,Until we reach, where\\'er he be,The wretch who stole thy spouse from thee.Then if the Gods will not restoreThy Sítá when the search is o\\'er,Then, royal lord of Kosal land,No longer hold thy vengeful hand.If meekness, prayer, and right be weakTo bring thee back the dame we seek,Up, brother, with a deadly showerOf gold-bright shafts thy foes o\\'erpower,Fierce as the flashing levin sentFrom King Mahendra firmament.Canto LXVII. Ráma Appeased.As Ráma, pierced by sorrow sting,Lamented like a helpless thing,And by his mighty woe distraughtWas lost in maze of troubled thought,Sumitrá son with loving careConsoled him in his wild despair,And while his feet he gently pressedWith words like these the chief addressed:\"For sternest vow and noblest deedWas Dasaratha blessed with seed.Thee for his son the king obtained,Like Amrit by the Gods regained.Thy gentle graces won his heart,And all too weak to live apartThe monarch died, as Bharat told,And lives on high mid Gods enrolled.If thou, O Ráma, wilt not bearThis grief which fills thee with despair,How shall a weaker man e\\'er hope,Infirm and mean, with woe to cope?Take heart, I pray thee, noblest chief:What man who breathes is free from grief?Misfortunes come and burn like flame,Then fly as quickly as they came.Yayáti son of Nahush reignedWith Indra on the throne he gained.But falling for a light offenceHe mourned a while the consequence.Vasishtha, reverend saint and sage,Priest of our sire from youth to age,Begot a hundred sons, but theyWere smitten in a single day.(511)And she, the queen whom all revere,The mother whom we hold so dear,The earth herself not seldom feelsFierce fever when she shakes and reels.And those twin lights, the world great eyes,On which the universe relies,--Does not eclipse at times assailTheir brilliance till their fires grow pale?The mighty Powers, the Immortal BlestBend to a law which none contest.No God, no bodied life is freeFrom conquering Fate supreme decree.E\\'en Sakra self must reap the meedOf virtue and of sinful deed.And O great lord of men, wilt thouHelpless beneath thy misery bow?No, if thy dame be lost or dead,O hero, still be comforted,Nor yield for ever to thy woeO\\'ermastered like the mean and low.Thy peers, with keen far-reaching eyes,Spend not their hours in ceaseless sighs;In dire distress, in whelming illTheir manly looks are hopeful still.To this, great chief, thy reason bend,And earnestly the truth perpend.By reason aid the wisest learnThe good and evil to discern.With sin and goodness scarcely knownFaint light by chequered lives is shown;Without some clear undoubted deedWe mark not how the fruits succeed.In time of old, O thou most brave,To me thy lips such counsel gave.Vrihaspati(512) can scarcely findNew wisdom to instruct thy mind.For thine is wit and genius highMeet for the children of the sky.I rouse that heart benumbed by painAnd call to vigorous life again.Be manly godlike vigour shown;Put forth that noblest strength, thine own.Strive, best of old Ikshváku strain,Strive till the conquered foe be slain.Where is the profit or the joyIf thy fierce rage the worlds destroy?Search till thou find the guilty foe,Then let thy hand no mercy show.\"Canto LXVIII. Jatáyus.Thus faithful Lakshman strove to cheerThe prince with counsel wise and clear.Who, prompt to seize the pith of all,Let not that wisdom idly fall.With vigorous effort he restrainedThe passion in his breast that reigned,And leaning on his bow for restHis brother Lakshman thus addressed:\"How shall we labour now, reflect;Whither again our search direct?Brother, what plan canst thou deviseTo bring her to these longing eyes?\"To him by toil and sorrow triedThe prudent Lakshman thus replied:\"Come, though our labour yet be vain,And search through Janasthán again,--A realm where giant foes abound,And trees and creepers hide the ground.For there are caverns deep and dread,By deer and wild birds tenanted,And hills with many a dark abyss,Grotto and rock and precipice.There bright Gandharvas love to dwell,And Kinnars in each bosky dell.With me thy eager search to aidBe every hill and cave surveyed.Great chiefs like thee, the best of men,Endowed with sense and piercing ken,Though tried by trouble never fail,Like rooted hills that mock the gale.\"Then Ráma, pierced by anger sting,Laid a keen arrow on his string,And by the faithful Lakshman sideRoamed through the forest far and wide.Jatáyus there with blood-drops dyed,Lying upon the ground he spied,Huge as a mountain shattered crest,Mid all the birds of air the best.In wrath the mighty bird he eyed,And thus the chief to Lakshman cried:\"Ah me, these signs the truth betray;My darling was the vulture prey.Some demon in the bird disguiseRoams through the wood that round us lies.On large-eyed Sítá he has fed,And rests him now with wings outspread.But my keen shafts whose flight is true,Shall pierce the ravenous monster through.\"An arrow on the string he laid,And rushing near the bird surveyed,While earth to ocean distant sideTrembled beneath his furious stride.With blood and froth on neck and beakThe dying bird essayed to speak,And with a piteous voice, distressed,Thus Dasaratha son addressed:\"She whom like some sweet herb of graceThou seekest in this lonely place,Fair lady, is fierce Rávan prey,Who took, beside, my life away.Lakshman and thou had parted henceAnd left the dame without defence.I saw her swiftly borne awayBy Rávan might which none could stay.I hurried to the lady aid,I crushed his car and royal shade,And putting forth my warlike mightHurled Rávan to the earth in fight.Here, Ráma, lies his broken bow,Here lie the arrows of the foe.There on the ground before thee areThe fragments of his battle car.There bleeds the driver whom my wingsBeat down with ceaseless buffetings.When toil my aged strength subdued,His sword my weary pinions hewed.Then lifting up the dame he bareHis captive through the fields of air.Thy vengeful blows from me restrain,Already by the giant slain.\"When Ráma heard the vulture tellThe tale that proved his love so well,His bow upon the ground he placed,And tenderly the bird embraced:Then to the earth he fell o\\'erpowered,And burning tears both brothers showered,For double pain and anguish pressedUpon the patient hero breast.The solitary bird he eyedWho in the lone wood gasped and sighed,And as again his anguish wokeThus Ráma to his brother spoke:\"Expelled from power the woods I tread,My spouse is lost, the bird is dead.A fate so sad, I ween, would tameThe vigour of the glorious flame.If I to cool my fever triedTo cross the deep from side to side,The sea,--so hard my fate,--would dryHis waters as my feet came nigh.In all this world there lives not oneSo cursed as I beneath the sun;So strong a net of misery castAround me holds the captive fast,Best of all birds that play the wing,Loved, honoured by our sire the king,The vulture, in my fate enwound,Lies bleeding, dying on the ground.\"Then Ráma and his brother stirredBy pity mourned the royal bird,And, as their hands his limbs caressed,Affection for a sire expressed.And Ráma to his bosom strainedThe bird with mangled wings distained,With crimson blood-drops dyed.He fell, and shedding many a tear,\"Where is my spouse than life more dear?Where is my love?\" he cried.Canto LXIX. The Death Of Jatáyus.As Ráma viewed with heart-felt painThe vulture whom the fiend had slain,In words with tender love impressedHis brother chief he thus addressed:\"This royal bird with faithful thoughtFor my advantage strove and fought.Slain by the fiend in mortal strifeFor me he yields his noble life.See, Lakshman, how his wounds have bled;His struggling breath will soon have fled.Faint is his voice, and near to die,He scarce can lift his trembling eye.Jatáyus, if thou still can speak,Give, give the answer that I seek.The fate of ravished Sítá tell,And how thy mournful chance befell.Say why the giant stole my dame:What have I done that he could blame?What fault in me has Rávan seenThat he should rob me of my queen?How looked the lady moon-bright cheek?What were the words she found to speak?His strength, his might, his deeds declare:And tell the form he loves to wear.To all my questions make reply:Where does the giant dwelling lie?\"The noble bird his glances bentOn Ráma as he made lament,And in low accents faint and weakWith anguish thus began to speak:\"Fierce Rávan, king of giant race,Stole Sítá from thy dwelling-place.He calls his magic art to aidWith wind and cloud and gloomy shade.When in the fight my power was spentMy wearied wings he cleft and rent.Then round the dame his arms he threw,And to the southern region flew.O Raghu son, I gasp for breath,My swimming sight is dim in death.E\\'en now before my vision passBright trees of gold with hair of grass,The hour the impious robber choseBrings on the thief a flood of woes.The giant in his haste forgot\\'Twas Vinda hour,(513) or heeded not.Those robbed at such a time obtainTheir plundered store and wealth again.He, like a fish that takes the bait,In briefest time shall meet his fate.Now be thy troubled heart controlledAnd for thy lady loss consoled,For thou wilt slay the fiend in fightAnd with thy dame have new delight.\"With senses clear, though sorely tried,The royal vulture thus replied,While as he sank beneath his painForth rushed the tide of blood again.\"Him,(514) brother of the Lord of Gold,Visravas\\' self begot of old.\"Thus spoke the bird, and stained with goreResigned the breath that came no more.\"Speak, speak again!\" thus Ráma cried,With reverent palm to palm applied,But from the frame the spirit fledAnd to the skiey regions sped.The breath of life had passed away.Stretched on the ground the body lay.When Ráma saw the vulture lie,Huge as a hill, with darksome eye,With many a poignant woe distressedHis brother chief he thus addressed:\"Amid these haunted shades contentFull many a year this bird has spent.His life in home of giants passed,In Dandak wood he dies at last.The years in lengthened course have fledUntroubled o\\'er the vulture head,And now he lies in death, for noneThe stern decrees of Fate may shun.See, Lakshman, how the vulture fellWhile for my sake he battled well.And strove to free with onset boldMy Sítá from the giant hold.Supreme amid the vulture kindHis ancient rule the bird resigned,And conquered in the fruitless strifeGave for my sake his noble life.O Lakshman, many a time we seeGreat souls who keep the law decree,With whom the weak sure refuge find,In creatures of inferior kind.The loss of her, my darling queen,Strikes with a pang less fiercely keenThan now this slaughtered bird to seeWho nobly fought and died for me.As Dasaratha, good and great,Was glorious in his high estate,Honoured by all, to all endeared,So was this royal bird revered.Bring fuel for the funeral rite:These hands the solemn fire shall lightAnd on the burning pyre shall layThe bird who died for me to-day.Now on the gathered wood shall lieThe lord of all the birds that fly,And I will burn with honours dueMy champion whom the giant slew.O royal bird of noblest heart,Graced with all funeral rites departTo bright celestial seats above,Rewarded for thy faithful love.Dwell in thy happy home with thoseWhose constant fires of worship rose.Live blest amid the unyielding brave,And those who land in largess gave.\"Sore grief upon his bosom weighedAs on the pyre the bird he laid,And bade the kindled flame ascendTo burn the body of his friend.Then with his brother by his sideThe hero to the forest hied.There many a stately deer he slew,The flesh around the bird to strew.The venison into balls he made,And on fair grass before him laid.Then that the parted soul might riseAnd find free passage to the skies,Each solemn word and text he saidWhich Bráhmans utter o\\'er the dead.Then hastening went the princely pairTo bright Godávarí, and thereLibations of the stream they pouredIn honour of the vulture lord,With solemn ritual to the slain,As scripture holy texts ordain.Thus offerings to the bird they gaveAnd bathed their bodies in the wave.The vulture monarch having wroughtA hard and glorious feat,Honoured by Ráma sage in thought,Soared to his blissful seat.The brothers, when each rite was paidTo him of birds supreme,Their hearts with new-found comfort stayed,And turned them from the stream.Like sovereigns of celestial raceWithin the wood they came,Each pondering the means to trace,The captor of the dame.Canto LXX. Kabandha.When every rite was duly paidThe princely brothers onward strayed,And eager in the lady questThey turned their footsteps to the west.Through lonely woods that round them layIkshváku children made their way,And armed with bow and shaft and brandPressed onward to the southern land.Thick trees and shrubs and creepers grewIn the wild grove they hurried through.\\'Twas dark and drear and hard to passFor tangled thorns and matted grass.Still onward with a southern courseThey made their way with vigorous force,And passing through the mazes stoodBeyond that vast and fearful wood.With toil and hardship yet unspentThree leagues from Janasthán they went,And speeding on their way at lastWithin the wood of Krauncha(515) passed:A fearful forest wild and blackAs some huge pile of cloudy rack,Filled with all birds and beasts, where grewBright blooms of every varied hue.On Sítá bending every thoughtThrough all the mighty wood they sought,And at the lady loss dismayedHere for a while and there they stayed.Then turning farther eastward theyPursued three leagues their weary way,Passed Krauncha wood and reached the groveWhere elephants rejoiced to rove.The chiefs that awful wood surveyedWhere deer and wild birds filled each glade,Where scarce a step the foot could takeFor tangled shrub and tree and brake.There in a mountain woody sideA cave the royal brothers spied,With dread abysses deep as hell,Where darkness never ceased to dwell.When, pressing on, the lords of menStood near the entrance of the den,They saw within the dark recessA huge misshapen giantess;A thing the timid heart that shookWith fearful shape and savage look.Terrific fiend, her voice was fierce,Long were her teeth to rend and pierce.The monster gorged her horrid feastOf flesh of many a savage beast,While her long locks, at random flung,Dishevelled o\\'er her shoulders hung.Their eyes the royal brothers raised,And on the fearful monster gazed.Forth from her den she came and glancedAt Lakshman as he first advanced,Her eager arms to hold him spread,And \"Come and be my love\" she said,Then as she held him to her breast,The prince in words like these addressed:\"Behold thy treasure fond and fair:Ayomukhi(516) the name I bear.In thickets of each lofty hill,On islets of each brook and rill,With me delighted shalt thou play,And live for many a lengthened day.\"Enraged he heard the monster woo;His ready sword he swiftly drew,And the sharp steel that quelled his foesCut through her breast and ear and nose.Thus mangled by his vengeful swordIn rage and pain the demon roared,And hideous with her awful faceSped to her secret dwelling place.Soon as the fiend had fled from sight,The brothers, dauntless in their might,Reached a wild forest dark and dreadWhose tangled ways were hard to tread.Then bravest Lakshman, virtuous youth,The friend of purity and truth,With reverent palm to palm appliedThus to his glorious brother cried:\"My arm presaging throbs amain,My troubled heart is sick with pain,And cheerless omens ill portendWhere\\'er my anxious eyes I bend.Dear brother, hear my words: advanceResolved and armed for every chance,For every sign I mark to-dayForetells a peril in the way.This bird of most ill-omened note,Loud screaming with discordant throat,Announces with a warning cryThat strife and victory are nigh.\"Then as the chiefs their search pursuedThroughout the dreary solitude,They heard amazed a mighty soundThat broke the very trees around,As though a furious tempest passedCrushing the wood beneath its blast.Then Ráma raised his trusty sword,And both the hidden cause explored.There stood before their wondering eyesA fiend broad-chested, huge of size.A vast misshapen trunk they sawIn height surpassing nature law.It stood before them dire and dreadWithout a neck, without a head.Tall as some hill aloft in air,Its limbs were clothed with bristling hair,And deep below the monster waistHis vast misshapen mouth was placed.His form was huge, his voice was loudAs some dark-tinted thunder cloud.Forth from his ample chest there cameA brilliance as of gushing flame.Beneath long lashes, dark and keenThe monster single eye was seen.Deep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,It glittered with terrific light.He swallowed down his savage fareOf lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,And with huge teeth exposed to viewO\\'er his great lips his tongue he drew.His arms unshapely, vast and dread,A league in length, he raised and spread.He seized with monstrous hands a herdOf deer and many a bear and bird.Among them all he picked and chose,Drew forward these, rejected those.Before the princely pair he stoodBarring their passage through the wood.A league of shade the chiefs had passedWhen on the fiend their eyes they cast.A monstrous shape without a headWith mighty arms before him spread,They saw that hideous trunk appearThat struck the trembling eye with fear.Then, stretching to their full extentHis awful arms with fingers bent,Round Raghu princely sons he castEach grasping limb and held them fast.Though strong of arm and fierce in fight,Each armed with bow and sword to smite,The royal brothers, brave and bold,Were helpless in the giant hold.Then Raghu son, heroic still,Felt not a pang his bosom thrill;But young, with no protection near,His brother heart was sad with fear,And thus with trembling tongue he saidTo Ráma, sore disquieted:\"Ah me, ah me, my days are told:O see me in the giant hold.Fly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,And thy dear self from danger free.Me to the fiend an offering give;Fly at thine ease thyself and live.Thou, great Kakutstha son, I ween,Wilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,And when thou holdest, throned again,Thine old hereditary reign,With servants prompt to do thy will,O think upon thy brother still.\"As thus the trembling Lakshman cried,The dauntless Ráma thus replied:\"Brother, from causeless dread forbear.A chief like thee should scorn despair.\"He spoke to soothe his wild alarm:Then fierce Kabandha(517) long of arm,Among the Dánavs(518) first and best,The sons of Raghu thus addressed:\"What men are you, whose shoulders showBroad as a bull, with sword and bow,Who roam this dark and horrid place,Brought by your fate before my face?Declare by what occasion ledThese solitary wilds you tread,With swords and bows and shafts to pierce,Like bulls whose horns are strong and fierce.Why have you sought this forest landWhere wild with hunger pangs I stand?Now as your steps my path have crossedEsteem your lives already lost.\"The royal brothers heard with dreadThe words which fierce Kabandha said.And Ráma to his brother cried,Whose cheek by blanching fear was dried:\"Alas, we fall, O valiant chief,From sorrow into direr grief,Still mourning her I hold so dearWe see our own destruction near.Mark, brother, mark what power has timeO\\'er all that live, in every clime.Now, lord of men, thyself and meInvolved in fatal danger see.\\'Tis not, be sure, the might of FateThat crushes all with deadly weight.Ne\\'er can the brave and strong, who knowThe use of spear and sword and bow,The force of conquering time withstand,But fall like barriers built of sand.\"Thus in calm strength which naught could shakeThe son of Dasaratha spake,With glory yet unstainedUpon Sumitrá son he bentHis eyes, and firm in his intentHis dauntless heart maintained.Canto LXXI. Kabandha Speech.Kabandha saw each chieftain standImprisoned by his mighty hand,Which like a snare around him pressedAnd thus the royal pair addressed:\"Why, warriors, are your glances bentOn me whom hungry pangs torment?Why stand with wildered senses? FateHas brought you now my maw to sate.\"When Lakshman heard, a while appalled,His ancient courage he recalled,And to his brother by his sideWith seasonable counsel cried:\"This vilest of the giant raceWill draw us to his side apace.Come, rouse thee; let the vengeful swordSmite off his arms, my honoured lord.This awful giant, vast of size,On his huge strength of arm relies,And o\\'er the world victorious, thusWith mighty force would slaughter us.But in cold blood to slay, O King,Discredit on the brave would bring,As when some victim in the riteShuns not the hand upraised to smite.\"The monstrous fiend, to anger stirred,The converse of the brothers heard.His horrid mouth he opened wideAnd drew the princes to his side.They, skilled due time and place to noteUnsheathed their glittering swords and smote,Till from the giant shoulders theyHad hewn the mighty arms away.His trenchant falchion Ráma pliedAnd smote him on the better side,While valiant Lakshman on the leftThe arm that held him prisoned cleft.Then to the earth dismembered fellThe monster with a hideous yell,And like a cloud his deep roar wentThrough earth and air and firmament.Then as the giant blood flowed fast,On his cleft limbs his eye he cast,And called upon the princely pairTheir names and lineage to declare.Him then the noble Lakshman, blestWith fortune favouring marks, addressed,And told the fiend his brother nameAnd the high blood of which he came:\"Ikshváku heir here Ráma stands,Illustrious through a hundred lands.I, younger brother of the heir,O fiend, the name of Lakshman bear.His mother stole his realm awayAnd drove him forth in woods to stray.Thus through the mighty forest heRoamed with his royal wife and me.While glorious as a God he madeHis dwelling in the greenwood shade,Some giant stole away his dame,And seeking her we hither came.But tell me who thou art, and whyWith headless trunk that towered so high,With flaming face beneath thy chest,Thou liest crushed in wild unrest.\"He heard the words that Lakshman spoke,And memory in his breast awoke,Recalling Indra words to mindHe spoke in gentle tones and kind:\"O welcome best of men, are yeWhom, blest by fate, this day I see.A blessing on each trenchant bladeThat low on earth these arms has laid!Thou, lord of men, incline thine earThe story of my woe to hear,While I the rebel pride declareWhich doomed me to the form I wear.\"Canto LXXII. Kabandha Tale.\"Lord of the mighty arm, of yoreA shape transcending thought I wore,And through the triple world extentMy fame for might and valour went.Scarce might the sun and moon on high,Scarce Sakra, with my beauty vie.Then for a time this form I took,And the great world with trembling shook.The saints in forest shades who dweltThe terror of my presence felt.But once I stirred to furious rageGreat Sthúlasiras, glorious sage.Culling in woods his hermit foodMy hideous shape with fear he viewed.Then forth his words of anger burstThat bade me live a thing accursed:\"Thou, whose delight is others\\' pain,This grisly form shalt still retain.\"Then when I prayed him to relentAnd fix some term of punishment,--Prayed that the curse at length might cease,He bade me thus expect release:\"Let Ráma cleave thine arms awayAnd on the pyre thy body lay,And then shalt thou, set free from doom,Thine own fair shape once more assume.\"O Lakshman, hear my words: in meThe world-illustrious Danu see.By Indra curse, subdued in fight,I wear this form which scares the sight.By sternest penance long maintainedThe mighty Father grace I gained.When length of days the God bestowed,With foolish pride my bosom glowed.My life, of lengthened years assured,I deemed from Sakra might secured.Let by my senseless pride astrayI challenged Indra to the fray.A flaming bolt with many a knotWith his terrific arm he shot,And straight my head and thighs compressedWere buried in my bulky chest.Deaf to each prayer and piteous callHe sent me not to Yáma hall.\"Thy prayers and cries,\" he said \"are vain:The Father word must true remain.\"\"But how may lengthened life be spentBy one the bolt has torn and rent?How can I live,\" I cried, \"unfed,With shattered face and thighs and head?\"As thus I spoke his grace to crave,Arms each a league in length he gave,And opened in my chest beneathThis mouth supplied with fearful teeth.So my huge arms I used to castRound woodland creatures as they passed,And fed within the forest hereOn lion, tiger, pard, and deer.Then Indra spake to soothe my grief:\"When Ráma and his brother chiefFrom thy huge bulk those arms shall cleave,Then shall the skies thy soul receive.\"Disguised in this terrific shapeI let no woodland thing escape,And still my longing soul was pleasedWhene\\'er my arms a victim seized,For in these arms I fondly thoughtWould Ráma self at last be caught.Thus hoping, toiling many a dayI yearned to cast my life away,And here, my lord, thou standest now:Blessings be thine! for none but thouCould cleave my arms with trenchant stroke:True are the words the hermit spoke.Now let me, best of warriors, lendMy counsel, and thy plans befriend,And aid thee with advice in turnIf thou with fire my corse wilt burn.\"As thus the mighty Danu prayedWith offer of his friendly aid,While Lakshman gazed with anxious eye,The virtuous Ráma made reply:\"Lakshman and I through forest shadeFrom Janasthán a while had strayed.When none was near her, Rávan cameAnd bore away my glorious dame,The giant form and size unknown,I learn as yet his name alone.Not yet the power and might we knowOr dwelling of the monstrous foe.With none our helpless feet to guideWe wander here by sorrow tried.Let pity move thee to requiteOur service in the funeral rite.Our hands shall bring the boughs that, dryWhere elephants have rent them, lie,Then dig a pit, and light the fireTo burn thee as the laws require.Do thou as meed of this declareWho stole my spouse, his dwelling where.O, if thou can, I pray thee say,And let this grace our deeds repay.\"Danu had lent attentive earThe words which Ráma spoke to hear,And thus, a speaker skilled and tried,To that great orator replied:\"No heavenly lore my soul endows,Naught know I of thy Maithil spouse.Yet will I, when my shape I wear,Him who will tell thee all declare.Then, Ráma, will my lips discloseHis name who well that giant knows.But till the flames my corse devourThis hidden knowledge mocks my power.For through that curse withering taintMy knowledge now is small and faint.Unknown the giant very nameWho bore away the Maithil dame.Cursed for my evil deeds I woreA shape which all the worlds abhor.Now ere with wearied steeds the sunThrough western skies his course have run,Deep in a pit my body layAnd burn it in the wonted way.When in the grave my corse is placed,With fire and funeral honours graced,Then I, great chief, his name will tellWho knows the giant robber well.With him, who guides his life aright,In league of trusting love unite,And he, O valiant prince, will beA faithful friend and aid to thee.For, Ráma, to his searching eyesThe triple world uncovered lies.For some dark cause of old, I ween,Through all the spheres his ways have been.\"Canto LXXIII. Kabandha Counsel.The monster ceased: the princely pairHeard great Kabandha eager prayer.Within a mountain cave they sped,Where kindled fire with care they fed.Then Lakshman in his mighty handsBrought ample store of lighted brands,And to a pile of logs appliedThe flame that ran from side to side.The spreading glow with gentle forceConsumed Kabandha mighty corse,Till the unresting flames had drunkThe marrow of the monstrous trunk,As balls of butter melt awayAmid the fires that o\\'er them play.Then from the pyre, like flame that glowsUndimmed by cloudy smoke, he rose,In garments pure of spot or speck,A heavenly wreath about his neck.Resplendent in his bright attireHe sprang exultant from the pyre.While from neck, arm, and foot was sentThe flash of gold and ornament.High on a chariot, bright of hue,Which swans of fairest pinion drew,He filled each region of the airWith splendid glow reflected there.Then in the sky he stayed his carAnd called to Ráma from afar:\"Hear, chieftain, while my lips explainThe means to win thy spouse again.Six plans, O prince, the wise pursueTo reach the aims we hold in view.(519)When evils ripening sorely pressThey load the wretch with new distress,So thou and Lakshman, tried by woe,Have felt at last a fiercer blow,And plunged in bitterest grief to-dayLament thy consort torn away.There is no course but this: attend;Make, best of friends, that chief thy friend.Unless his prospering help thou gainThy plans and hopes must all be vain.O Ráma, hear my words, and seek,Sugríva, for of him I speak.His brother Báli, Indra son,Expelled him when the fight was won.With four great chieftains, faithful still,He dwells on Rishyamúka hill.--Fair mountain, lovely with the flowOf Pampá waves that glide below,--Lord of the Vánars(520) just and true,Strong, very glorious, bright to view,Unmatched in counsel, firm and meek,Bound by each word his lips may speak,Good, splendid, mighty, bold and brave,Wise in each plan to guide and save.His brother, fired by lust of sway,Drove forth the prince in woods to stray.In all thy search for Sítá heThy ready friend and help will be.With him to aid thee in thy questDismiss all sorrow from thy breast.Time is a mighty power, and noneHis fixed decree can change or shun.So rich reward thy toil shall bless,And naught can stay thy sure success.Speed hence, O chief, without delay,To strong Sugríva take thy way.This hour thy footsteps onward bend,And make that mighty prince thy friend.With him before the attesting flameIn solemn truth alliance frame.Nor wilt thou, if thy heart be wise,Sugríva, Vánar king, despise.Of boundless strength, all shapes he wears,He hearkens to a suppliant prayers,And, grateful for each kindly deed,Will help and save in hour of need.And you, I ween, the power possessTo aid his hopes and give redress.He, let his cause succeed or fail,Will help you, and you must prevail.A banished prince, in fear and woeHe roams where Pampá waters flow,True offspring of the Lord of LightExpelled by Báli conquering might.Go, Raghu son, that chieftain seekWho dwells on Rishyamúka peak.Before the flame thy weapons castAnd bind the bonds of friendship fast.For, prince of all the Vánar race,He in his wisdom knows each placeWhere dwell the fierce gigantic broodWho make the flesh of man their food.To him, O Raghu son, to himNaught in the world is dark or dim,Where\\'er the mighty Day-God gleamsResplendent with a thousand beams.He over rocky height and hill,Through gloomy cave, by lake and rill,Will with his Vánars seek the prize,And tell thee where thy lady lies.And he will send great chieftains forthTo east and west and south and north,To seek the distant spot where sheAll desolate laments for thee.He even in Rávan halls would findThy Sítá, gem of womankind.Yea, if the blameless lady layOn Meru loftiest steep,Or, far removed from light of day,Where hell is dark and deep,That chief of all the Vánar raceHis way would still explore,Meet the cowed giants face to faceAnd thy dear spouse restore.\"Canto LXXIV. Kabandha Death.When wise Kabandha thus had taughtThe means to find the dame they sought,And urged them onward in the quest,He thus again the prince addressed:\"This path, O Raghu son, pursueWhere those fair trees which charm the view,Extending westward far away,The glory of their bloom display,Where their bright leaves Rose-apples show,And the tall Jak and Mango grow.Whene\\'er you will, those trees ascend,Or the long branches shake and bend,Their savoury fruit like Amrit eat,Then onward speed with willing feet.Beyond this shady forest, deckedWith flowering trees, your course direct.Another grove you then will findWith every joy to take the mind,Like Nandan with its charms displayed,Or Northern Kuru blissful shade;Where trees distil their balmy juice,And fruit through all the year produce;Where shades with seasons ever fairWith Chaitraratha may compare:Where trees whose sprays with fruit are bowedRise like a mountain or a cloud.There, when you list, from time to time,The loaded trees may Lakshman climb,Or from the shaken boughs supplySweet fruit that may with Amrit vie.The onward path pursuing stillFrom wood to wood, from hill to hill,Your happy eyes at length will restOn Pampá lotus-covered breast.Her banks with gentle slope descend,Nor stones nor weed the eyes offend,And o\\'er smooth beds of silver sandLotus and lily blooms expand.There swans and ducks and curlews play,And keen-eyed ospreys watch their prey,And from the limpid waves are heardGlad notes of many a water-bird.Untaught a deadly foe to fearThey fly not when a man is near,And fat as balls of butter theyWill, when you list, your hunger stay.Then Lakshman with his shafts will takeThe fish that swim the brook and lake,Remove each bone and scale and fin,Or strip away the speckled skin,And then on iron skewers broilFor thy repast the savoury spoil.Thou on a heap of flowers shalt restAnd eat the meal his hands have dressed,There shalt thou lie on Pampá brink,And Lakshman hand shall give thee drink,Filling a lotus leaf with coolPure water from the crystal pool,To which the opening blooms have lentThe riches of divinest scent.Beside thee at the close of dayWill Lakshman through the woodland stray,And show thee where the monkeys sleepIn caves beneath the mountain steep.Loud-voiced as bulls they forth will burstAnd seek the flood, oppressed by thirst;Then rest a while, their wants supplied,Their well-fed bands on Pampá side.Thou roving there at eve shalt seeRich clusters hang on shrub and tree,And Pampá flushed with roseate glow,And at the view forget thy woe.There shalt thou mark with strange delightEach loveliest flower that blooms by night,While lily buds that shrink from dayTheir tender loveliness display.In that far wild no hand but thineThose peerless flowers in wreaths shall twine:Immortal in their changeless pride,Ne\\'er fade those blooms and ne\\'er are dried.There erst on holy thoughts intentTheir days Matanga pupils spent.Once for their master food they sought,And store of fruit and berries brought.Then as they laboured through the dellFrom limb and brow the heat-drops fell:Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees:Such holy power have devotees.Thus, from the hermits\\' heat-drops sprung,Their growth is ever fresh and young.There Savarí is dwelling yet,Who served each vanished anchoret.Beneath the shade of holy boughsThat ancient votaress keeps her vows.Her happy eyes on thee will fall,O godlike prince, adored by all,And she, whose life is pure from sin,A blissful seat in heaven will win.But cross, O son of Raghu, o\\'er,And stand on Pampá western shore.A tranquil hermitage that liesDeep in the woods will meet thine eyes.No wandering elephants invadeThe stillness of that holy shade,But checked by saint Matanga powerThey spare each consecrated bower.Through many an age those trees have stoodWorld-famous as Matanga woodStill, Raghu son, pursue thy way:Through shades where birds are vocal stray,Fair as the blessed wood where roveImmortal Gods, or Nandan grove.Near Pampá eastward, full in sight,Stands Rishyamúka wood-crowned height.\\'Tis hard to climb that towering steepWhere serpents unmolested sleep.The free and bounteous, formed of oldBy Brahmá of superior mould,Who sink when day is done to restReclining on that mountain crest,--What wealth or joy in dreams they view,Awaking find the vision true.But if a villain stained with crimeThat holy hill presume to climb,The giants in their fury sweepFrom the hill top the wretch asleep.There loud and long is heard the roarOf elephants on Pampá shore,Who near Matanga dwelling strayAnd in those waters bathe and play.A while they revel by the flood,Their temples stained with streams like blood,Then wander far away dispersed,Dark as huge clouds before they burst.But ere they part they drink their fillOf bright pure water from the rill,Delightful to the touch, where meetScents of all flowers divinely sweet,Then speeding from the river sideDeep in the sheltering thicket hide.Then bears and tigers shalt thou viewWhose soft skins show the sapphire hue,And silvan deer that wander nighShall harmless from thy presence fly.High in that mountain wooded sideIs a fair cavern deep and wide,Yet hard to enter: piles of rockThe portals of the cavern block.(521)Fast by the eastern door a poolGleams with broad waters fresh and cool,Where stores of roots and fruit abound,And thick trees shade the grassy ground.This mountain cave the virtuous-souledSugríva, and his Vánars hold,And oft the mighty chieftain seeksThe summits of those towering peaks.\"Thus spake Kabandha high in airHis counsel to the royal pair.Still on his neck that wreath he bore,And radiance like the sun he wore.Their eyes the princely brothers raisedAnd on that blissful being gazed:\"Behold, we go: no more delay;Begin,\" they cried, \"thy heavenward way.\"\"Depart,\" Kabandha voice replied,\"Pursue your search, and bliss betide.\"Thus to the happy chiefs he said,Then on his heavenward journey sped.Thus once again Kabandha wonA shape that glittered like the sunWithout a spot or stain.Thus bade he Ráma from the airTo great Sugríva side repairHis friendly love to gain.Canto LXXV. Savarí.Thus counselled by their friendly guideOn through the wood the princes hied,Pursuing still the eastern roadTo Pampá which Kabandha showed,Where trees that on the mountains grewWith fruit like honey charmed the view.They rested weary for the nightUpon a mountain wooded height,Then onward with the dawn they hiedAnd stood on Pampá western side,Where Savarí fair home they viewedDeep in that shady solitude.The princes reached the holy groundWhere noble trees stood thick around,And joying in the lovely viewNear to the aged votaress drew.To meet the sons of Raghu came,With hands upraised, the pious dame,And bending low with reverence meetWelcomed them both and pressed their feet.Then water, as beseems, she gave,Their lips to cool, their feet to lave.To that pure saint who never brokeOne law of duty Ráma spoke:\"I trust no cares invade thy peace,While holy works and zeal increase;That thou content with scanty foodAll touch of ire hast long subdued;That all thy vows are well maintainedWhile peace of mind is surely gained,That reverence of the saints who taughtThy faithful heart due fruit has brought.\"The aged votaress pure of taint,Revered by every perfect saint,Rose to her feet by Ráma sideAnd thus in gentle tones replied:\"My penance meed this day I seeComplete, my lord, in meeting thee.This day the fruit of birth I gain,Nor have I served the saints in vain.I reap rich fruits of toil and vow,And heaven itself awaits me now,When I, O chief of men, have doneHonour to thee the godlike one.I feel, great lord, thy gentle eyeMy earthly spirit purify,And I, brave tamer of thy foes,Shall through thy grace in bliss repose.Thy feet by Chitrakúta strayedWhen those great saints whom I obeyed,In dazzling chariots bright of hue,Hence to their heavenly mansions flew.As the high saints were borne awayI heard their holy voices say:\"In this pure grove, O devotee,Prince Ráma soon will visit thee.When he and Lakshman seek this shade,Be to thy guests all honour paid.Him shalt thou see, and pass awayTo those blest worlds which ne\\'er decay.\"To me, O mighty chief, the bestOf lofty saints these words addressed.Laid up within my dwelling lieFruits of each sort which woods supply,--Food culled for thee in endless storeFrom every tree on Pampá shore.\"Thus to her virtuous guest she suedAnd he, with heavenly lore endued,Words such as these in turn addressedTo her with equal knowledge blest:\"Danu himself the power has toldOf thy great masters lofty-souled.Now if thou will, mine eyes would fainAssurance of their glories gain.\"She heard the prince his wish declare:Then rose she, and the royal pairOf brothers through the wood she ledThat round her holy dwelling spread.\"Behold Matanga wood\" she cried,\"A grove made famous far and wide.Dark as thick clouds and filled with herdsOf wandering deer, and joyous birds.In this pure spot each reverend sireWith offerings fed the holy fire.See here the western altar standsWhere daily with their trembling handsThe aged saints, so long obeyedBy me, their gifts of blossoms laid.The holy power, O Raghu son,By their ascetic virtue won,Still keeps their well-loved altar bright,Filling the air with beams of light.And those seven neighbouring lakes beholdWhich, when the saints infirm and old,Worn out by fasts, no longer sought,Moved hither drawn by power of thought.Look, Ráma, where the devoteesHung their bark mantles on the trees,Fresh from the bath: those garments wetThrough many a day are dripping yet.See, through those aged hermits\\' powerThe tender spray, this bright-hued flowerWith which the saints their worship paid,Fresh to this hour nor change nor fade.Here thou hast seen each lawn and dell,And heard the tale I had to tell:Permit thy servant, lord, I pray,To cast this mortal shell away,For I would dwell, this life resigned,With those great saints of lofty mind,Whom I within this holy shadeWith reverential care obeyed.\"When Ráma and his brother heardThe pious prayer the dame preferred,Filled full of transport and amazedThey marvelled as her words they praised.Then Ráma to the votaress saidWhose holy vows were perfected:\"Go, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,O thou who well hast honoured me.\"Her locks in hermit fashion tied,Clad in bark coat and black deer-hide,When Ráma gave consent, the dameResigned her body to the flame.Then like the fire that burns and glows,To heaven the sainted lady rose,In all her heavenly garments dressed,Immortal wreaths on neck and breast,Bright with celestial gems she shoneMost beautiful to look upon,And like the flame of lightning sentA glory through the firmament.That holy sphere the dame attained,By depth of contemplation gained,Where roam high saints with spirits pureIn bliss that shall for aye endure.Canto LXXVI. Pampá.When Savarí had sought the skiesAnd gained her splendid virtue prize,Ráma with Lakshman stayed to broodO\\'er the strange scenes their eyes had viewed.His mind upon those saints was bent,For power and might preëminentAnd he to musing Lakshman spokeThe thoughts that in his bosom woke:\"Mine eyes this wondrous home have viewedOf those great saints with souls subdued,Where peaceful tigers dwell and birds,And deer abound in heedless herds.Our feet upon the banks have stoodOf those seven lakes within the wood,Where we have duly dipped, and paidLibations to each royal shade.Forgotten now are thoughts of illAnd joyful hopes my bosom fill.Again my heart is light and gayAnd grief and care have passed away.Come, brother, let us hasten whereBright Pampá flood is fresh and fair,And towering in their beauty nearMount Rishyamúka heights appear,Which, offspring of the Lord of Light,Still fearing Báli conquering might,With four brave chiefs of Vánar raceSugríva makes his dwelling-place.I long with eager heart to findThat leader of the Vánar kind,For on that chief my hopes dependThat this our quest have prosperous end.\"Thus Ráma spoke, in battle tried,And thus Sumitrá son replied:\"Come, brother, come, and speed away:My spirit brooks no more delay.\"Thus spake Sumitrá son, and thenForth from the grove the king of menWith his dear brother by his sideTo Pampá lucid waters hied.He gazed upon the woods where grewTrees rich in flowers of every hue.From brake and dell on every sideThe curlew and the peacock cried,And flocks of screaming parrots madeShrill music in the bloomy shade.His eager eyes, as on he went,On many a pool and tree were bent.Inflamed with love he journeyed onTill a fair flood before him shone.He stood upon the water sideWhich streams from distant hills supplied:Matanga name that water bore:There bathed he from the shelving shore.Then, each on earnest thoughts intent,Still farther on their way they went.But Ráma heart once more gave wayBeneath his grief and wild dismay.Before him lay the noble floodAdorned with many a lotus bud.On its fair banks Asoka glowed,And all bright trees their blossoms showed.Green banks that silver waves confinedWith lovely groves were fringed and lined.The crystal waters in their flowShowed level sands that gleamed below.There glittering fish and tortoise played,And bending trees gave pleasant shade.There creepers on the branches hungWith lover-like embraces clung.There gay Gandharvas loved to meet,And Kinnars sought the calm retreat.There wandering Yakshas found delight,Snake-gods and rovers of the night.Cool were the pleasant waters, gayEach tree with creeper, flower, and spray.There flushed the lotus darkly red,Here their white glory lilies spread,Here sweet buds showed their tints of blue:So carpets gleam with many a hue.A grove of Mangoes blossomed nigh,Echoing with the peacock cry.When Ráma by his brother sideThe lovely flood of Pampá eyed,Decked like a beauty, fair to seeWith every charm of flower and tree,His mighty heart with woe was rentAnd thus he spoke in wild lament\"Here, Lakshman, on this beauteous shore,Stands, dyed with tints of many an ore,The mountain Rishyamúka brightWith flowery trees that crown each height.Sprung from the chief who, famed of yore,The name of Riksharajas bore,Sugríva, chieftain strong and dread,Dwells on that mountain towering head.Go to him, best of men, and seekThat prince of Vánars on the peak,I cannot longer brook my pain,Or, Sítá lost, my life retain.\"Thus by the pangs of love distressed,His thoughts on Sítá bent,His faithful brother he addressed,And cried in wild lament.He reached the lovely ground that layOn Pampá wooded side,And told in anguish and dismay,The grief he could not hide.With listless footsteps faint and slowHis way the chief pursued,Till Pampá with her glorious showOf flowering woods he viewed.Through shades where every bird was foundThe prince with Lakshman passed,And Pampá with her groves aroundBurst on his eyes at last.',\n",
       " 'BOOK 4': 'Canto I. Ráma Lament.The princes stood by Pampá side(522)Which blooming lilies glorified.With troubled heart and sense o\\'erthrownThere Ráma made his piteous moan.As the fair flood before him layThe reason of the chief gave way;And tender thoughts within him woke,As to Sumitrá son he spoke:\"How lovely Pampá waters show,Where streams of lucid crystal flow!What glorious trees o\\'erhang the floodWhich blooms of opening lotus stud!Look on the banks of Pampá whereThick groves extend divinely fair;And piles of trees, like hills in size,Lift their proud summits to the skies.But thought of Bharat(523) pain and toil,And my dear spouse the giant spoil,Afflict my tortured heart and pressMy spirit down with heaviness.Still fair to me though sunk in woeBright Pampá and her forest show.Where cool fresh waters charm the sight,And flowers of every hue are bright.The lotuses in close arrayTheir passing loveliness display,And pard and tiger, deer and snakeHaunt every glade and dell and brake.Those grassy spots display the hueOf topazes and sapphires\\' blue,And, gay with flowers of every dye,With richly broidered housings vie.What loads of bloom the high trees crown,Or weigh the bending branches down!And creepers tipped with bud and flowerEach spray and loaded limb o\\'erpower.Now cool delicious breezes blow,And kindle love voluptuous glow,When balmy sweetness fills the air,And fruit and flowers and trees are fair.Those waving woods, that shine with bloom,Each varied tint in turn assume.Like labouring clouds they pour their showersIn rain or ever-changing flowers.Behold, those forest trees, that standHigh upon rock and table-land,As the cool gales their branches bend,Their floating blossoms downward send.See, Lakshman, how the breezes playWith every floweret on the spray.And sport in merry guise with allThe fallen blooms and those that fall.See, brother, where the merry breezeShakes the gay boughs of flowery trees,Disturbed amid their toil a throngOf bees pursue him, loud in song.The Koďls,(524) mad with sweet delight,The bending trees to dance invite;And in its joy the wild wind singsAs from the mountain cave he springs.On speed the gales in rapid course,And bend the woods beneath their force,Till every branch and spray they bindIn many a tangled knot entwined.What balmy sweets those gales dispenseWith cool and sacred influence!Fatigue and trouble vanish: suchThe magic of their gentle touch.Hark, when the gale the boughs has bentIn woods of honey redolent,Through all their quivering sprays the treesAre vocal with the murmuring bees.The hills with towering summits rise,And with their beauty charm the eyes,Gay with the giant trees which brightWith blossom spring from every height:And as the soft wind gently swaysThe clustering blooms that load the sprays,The very trees break forth and singWith startled wild bees\\' murmuring.Thine eyes to yonder Cassias(525) turnWhose glorious clusters glow and burn.Those trees in yellow robes behold,Like giants decked with burnished gold.Ah me, Sumitrá son, the springDear to sweet birds who love and sing,Wakes in my lonely breast the flameOf sorrow as I mourn my dame.Love strikes me through with darts of fire,And wakes in vain the sweet desire.Hark, the loud Koďl swells his throat,And mocks me with his joyful note.I hear the happy wild-cock callBeside the shady waterfall.His cry of joy afflicts my breastBy love absorbing might possessed.My darling from our cottage heardOne morn in spring this shrill-toned bird,And called me in her joy to hearThe happy cry that charmed her ear.See, birds of every varied voiceAround us in the woods rejoice,On creeper, shrub, and plant alight,Or wing from tree to tree their flight.Each bird his kindly mate has found,And loud their notes of triumph sound,Blending in sweetest music likeThe distant warblings of the shrike.See how the river banks are linedWith birds of every hue and kind.Here in his joy the Koďl sings,There the glad wild-cock flaps his wings.The blooms of bright Asokas(526) whereThe song of wild bees fills the air,And the soft whisper of the boughsIncrease my longing for my spouse.The vernal flush of flower and sprayWill burn my very soul away.What use, what care have I for lifeIf I no more may see my wifeSoft speaker with the glorious hair,And eyes with silken lashes fair?Now is the time when all day longThe Koďls fill the woods with song.And gardens bloom at spring sweet touchWhich my beloved loved so much.Ah me, Sumitrá son, the fireOf sorrow, sprung from soft desire,Fanned by the charms the spring time shows,Will burn my heart and end my woes,Whose sad eyes look on each fair tree,But my sweet love no more may see.Ah me, Ah me, from hour to hourLove in my soul will wax in power,And spring, upon whose charms I gaze,Whose breath the heat of toil allays,With thoughts of her for whom I strainMy hopeless eyes, increase my pain.As fire in summer rages throughThe forests thick with dry bamboo,So will my fawn eyed love consumeMy soul o\\'erwhelmed with thoughts of gloom.Behold, beneath each spreading treeThe peacocks dance(527) in frantic glee,And, stirred by all the gales that blow,Their tails with jewelled windows glow,Each bird, in happy love elate,Rejoices with his darling mate.But sights like these of joy and peaceMy pangs of hopeless love increase.See on the mountain slope aboveThe peahen languishing with love.Behold her now in amorous danceClose to her consort side advance.He with a laugh of joy and prideDisplays his glittering pinions wide;And follows through the tangled dellThe partner whom he loves so well.Ah happy bird! no giant hateHas robbed him of his tender mate;And still beside his loved one heDances beneath the shade in glee.Ah, in this month when flowers are fairMy widowed woe is hard to bear.See, gentle love a home may findIn creatures of inferior kind.See how the peahen turns to meetHer consort now with love-drawn feet.So, Lakshman, if my large-eyed dear,The child of Janak still were here,She, by love thrilling influence led,Upon my breast would lay her head.These blooms I gathered from the boughWithout my love are useless now.A thousand blossoms fair to seeWith passing glory clothe each treeThat hangs its cluster-burthened headNow that the dewy months(528) are fled,But, followed by the bees that plyTheir fragrant task, they fall and die.A thousand birds in wild delightTheir rapture-breathing notes unite;Bird calls to bird in joyous strain,And turns my love to frenzied pain.O, if beneath those alien skies,There be a spring where Sítá lies,I know my prisoned love must beTouched with like grief, and mourn with me.But ah, methinks that dreary climeKnows not the touch of spring sweet time.How could my black eyed love sustain,Without her lord, so dire a pain?Or if the sweet spring come to herIn distant lands a prisoner,How may his advent and her metOn every side with taunt and threat?Ah, if the springtide languor cameWith soft enchantment o\\'er my dame,My darling of the lotus eye,My gently speaking love, would die;For well my spirit knows that sheCan never live bereft of meWith love that never wavered yetMy Sítá heart, on me is set,Who, with a soul that ne\\'er can stray,With equal love her love repay.In vain, in vain the soft wind bringsSweet blossoms on his balmy wings;Delicious from his native snow,To me like fire he seems to glow.O, how I loved a breeze like thisWhen darling Sítá shared the bliss!But now in vain for me it blowsTo fan the fury of my woes.That dark-winged bird that sought the skiesForetelling grief with warning cries,Sits on the tree where buds are gay,And pours glad music from the spray.That rover of the fields of airWill aid my love with friendly care,And me with gracious pity guideTo my large-eyed Videhan side.(529)Hark, Lakshman, how the woods aroundWith love-inspiring chants resound,Where birds in every bloom-crowned treePour forth their amorous minstrelsy.As though an eager gallant wooedA gentle maid by love subdued,Enamoured of her flowers the beeDarts at the wind-rocked Tila tree.(530)Asoka, brightest tree that grows,That lends a pang to lovers\\' woes,Hangs out his gorgeous bloom in scornAnd mocks me as I weep forlorn.O Lakshman, turn thine eye and seeEach blossom-laden Mango tree,Like a young lover gaily dressedWhom fond desire forbids to rest.Look, son of Queen Sumitrá throughThe forest glades of varied hue,Where blooms are bright and grass is greenThe Kinnars(531) with their loves are seen.See, brother, see where sweet and brightThose crimson lilies charm the sight,And o\\'er the flood a radiance throwFair as the morning roseate glow.See, Pampá, most divinely sweet,The swan and mallard loved retreat,Shows her glad waters bright and clear,Where lotuses their heads uprearFrom the pure wave, and charm the viewWith mingled tints of red and blue.Each like the morning early beamsReflected in the crystal gleams;And bees on their sweet toil intentWeigh down each tender filament.There with gay lawns the wood recedes;There wildfowl sport amid the reeds,There roedeer stand upon the brink,And elephants descend to drink.The rippling waves which winds make fleetAgainst the bending lilies beat,And opening bud and flower and stemGleam with the drops that hang on them.Life has no pleasure left for meWhile my dear queen I may not see,Who loved so well those blooms that vieWith the full splendour of her eye.O tyrant Love, who will not letMy bosom for one hour forgetThe lost one whom I yearn to meet,Whose words were ever kind and sweet.Ah, haply might my heart endureThis hopeless love that knows not cure,If spring with all his trees in flowerAssailed me not with ruthless power.Each lovely scene, each sound and sightWherein, with her, I found delight,Has lost the charm so sweet of yore,And glads my widowed heart no more.On lotus buds I seem to gaze,Or blooms that deck Palása(532) sprays;(533)But to my tortured memory riseThe glories of my darling eyes.Cool breezes through the forest strayGathering odours on their way,Enriched with all the rifled scentOf lotus flower and filament.Their touch upon my temples fallsAnd Sítá fragrant breath recalls.Now look, dear brother, on the rightOf Pampá towers a mountain heightWhere fairest Cassia trees unfoldThe treasures of their burnished gold.Proud mountain king! his woody sideWith myriad ores is decked and dyed,And as the wind-swept blossoms fallTheir fragrant dust is stained with all.To yon high lands thy glances turn:With pendent fire they flash and burn,Where in their vernal glory blazePalása flowers on leafless sprays.O Lakshman, look! on Pampá sideWhat fair trees rise in blooming pride!What climbing plants above them showOr hang their flowery garlands low!See how the amorous creeper ringsThe wind-rocked trees to which she clings,As though a dame by love impelledWith clasping arms her lover held.Drunk with the varied scents that fillThe balmy air, from hill to hill,From grove to grove, from tree to tree,The joyous wind is wandering free.These gay trees wave their branches bentBy blooms, of honey redolent.There, slowly opening to the day,Buds with dark lustre deck the spray.The wild bee rests a moment whereEach tempting flower is sweet and fair,Then, coloured by the pollen dyes,Deep in some odorous blossom lies.Soon from his couch away he springs:To other trees his course he wings,And tastes the honeyed blooms that growWhere Pampá lucid waters flow.See, Lakshman, see, how thickly spreadWith blossoms from the trees o\\'erhead,That grass the weary traveller woosWith couches of a thousand hues,And beds on every height arrayedWith red and yellow tints are laid,No longer winter chills the earth:A thousand flowerets spring to birth,And trees in rivalry assumeTheir vernal garb of bud and bloom.How fair they look, how bright and gayWith tasselled flowers on every spray!While each to each proud challenge flingsBorne in the song the wild bee sings.That mallard by the river edgeHas bathed amid the reeds and sedge:Now with his mate he fondly playsAnd fires my bosom as I gaze.Mandákiní(534) is far renowned:No lovelier flood on earth is found;But all her fairest charms combinedIn this sweet stream enchant the mind.O, if my love were here to lookWith me upon this lovely brook,Never for Ayodhyá would I pine,Or wish that Indra lot were mine.If by my darling side I strayedO\\'er the soft turf which decks the glade,Each craving thought were sweetly stilled,Each longing of my soul fulfilled.But, now my love is far away,Those trees which make the woods so gay,In all their varied beauty dressed,Wake thoughts of anguish in my breast.That lotus-covered stream beholdWhose waters run so fresh and cold,Sweet rill, the wildfowl loved resort,Where curlew, swan, and diver sport;Where with his consort plays the drake,And tall deer love their thirst to slake,While from each woody bank is heardThe wild note of each happy bird.The music of that joyous quireFills all my soul with soft desire;And, as I hear, my sad thoughts flyTo Sítá of the lotus eye,Whom, lovely with her moonbright cheek,In vain mine eager glances seek.Now turn, those chequered lawns surveyWhere hart and hind together stray.Ah, as they wander at their willMy troubled breast with grief they fill,While torn by hopeless love I sighFor Sítá of the fawn-like eye.If in those glades where, touched by spring,Gay birds their amorous ditties sing,Mine own beloved I might see,Then, brother, it were well with me:If by my side she wandered still,And this cool breeze that stirs the rillTouched with its gentle breath the browsOf mine own dear Videhan spouse.For, Lakshman, O how blest are thoseOn whom the breath of Pampá blows,Dispelling all their care and gloomWith sweets from where the lilies bloom!How can my gentle love remainAlive amid the woe and pain,Where prisoned far away she lies,--My darling of the lotus eyes?How shall I dare her sire to greetWhose lips have never known deceit?How stand before the childless kingAnd meet his eager questioning?When banished by my sire decree,In low estate, she followed me.So pure, so true to every vow,Where is my gentle darling now?How can I bear my widowed lot,And linger on where she is not,Who followed when from home I fledDistracted, disinherited?My spirit sinks in hopeless painWhen my fond glances yearn in vainFor that dear face with whose bright eyeThe worshipped lotus scarce can vie.Ah when, my brother, shall I hearThat voice that rang so soft and clear,When, sweetly smiling as she spoke,From her dear lips gay laughter broke?When worn with toil and love I strayedWith Sítá through the forest shade,No trace of grief was seen in her,My kind and thoughtful comforter.How shall my faltering tongue relateTo Queen Kausalyá Sítá fate?How answer when in wild despairShe questions, Where is Sítá, where?Haste, brother, haste: to Bharat hie,On whose fond love I still rely.My life can be no longer borne,Since Sítá from my side is torn.\"Thus like a helpless mourner, bentBy sorrow, Ráma made lament;And with wise counsel Lakshman triedTo soothe his care, and thus replied:\"O best of men, thy grief oppose,Nor sink beneath thy weight of woes.Not thus despond the great and pureAnd brave like thee, but still endure.Reflect what anguish wrings the heartWhen loving souls are forced to part;And, mindful of the coming pain,Thy love within thy breast restrain.For earth, though cooled by wandering streams,Lies scorched beneath the midday beams.Rávan his steps to hell may bend,Or lower yet in flight descend;But be thou sure, O Raghu son,Avenging death he shall not shun.Rise, Ráma, rise: the search begin,And track the giant foul with sin.Then shall the fiend, though far he fly,Resign his prey or surely die.Yea, though the trembling monster hideWith Sítá close to Diti(535) side,E\\'en there, unless he yield the prize,Slain by this wrathful hand he dies.Thy heart with strength and courage stay,And cast this weakling mood away.Our fainting hopes in vain reviveUnless with firm resolve we strive.The zeal that fires the toiler breastMid earthly powers is first and best.Zeal every check and bar defies,And wins at length the loftiest prize,In woe and danger, toil and care,Zeal never yields to weak despair.With zealous heart thy task begin,And thou once more thy spouse shalt win.Cast fruitless sorrow from thy soul,Nor let this love thy heart control.Forget not all thy sacred lore,But be thy noble self once more.\"He heard, his bosom rent by grief,The counsel of his brother chief;Crushed in his heart the maddening pain,And rose resolved and strong again.Then forth upon his journey wentThe hero on his task intent,Nor thought of Pampá lovely brook,Or trees which murmuring breezes shook,Though on dark woods his glances fell,On waterfall and cave and dell;And still by many a care distressedThe son of Raghu onward pressed.As some wild elephant elateMoves through the woods in pride,So Lakshman with majestic gaitStrode by his brother side.He, for his lofty spirit famed,Admonished and consoled;Showed Raghu son what duty claimed,And bade his heart be bold.Then as the brothers strode apaceTo Rishyamúka height,The sovereign of the Vánar race(536)Was troubled at the sight.As on the lofty hill he strayedHe saw the chiefs draw near:A while their glorious forms surveyed,And mused in restless fear.His slow majestic step he stayedAnd gazed upon the pair.And all his spirit sank dismayedBy fear too great to bear.When in their glorious might the bestOf royal chiefs came nigh,The Vánars in their wild unrestPrepared to turn and fly.They sought the hermit sacred home(537)For peace and bliss ordained,And there, where Vánars loved to roam,A sure asylum gained.Canto II. Sugríva Alarm.Sugríva moved by wondering aweThe high-souled sons of Raghu saw,In all their glorious arms arrayed;And grief upon his spirit weighed.To every quarter of the skyHe turned in fear his anxious eye,And roving still from spot to spotWith troubled steps he rested not.He durst not, as he viewed the pair,Resolve to stand and meet them there;And drooping cheer and quailing breastThe terror of the chief confessed.While the great fear his bosom shook,Brief counsel with his lords he took;Each gain and danger closely scanned,What hope in flight, what power to stand,While doubt and fear his bosom rent,On Raghu sons his eyes he bent,And with a spirit ill at easeAddressed his lords in words like these:\"Those chiefs with wandering steps invadeThe shelter of our pathless shade,And hither come in fair disguiseOf hermit garb as Báli spies.\"Each lord beheld with troubled heartThose masters of the bowman art,And left the mountain side to seekSure refuge on a loftier peak.The Vánar chief in rapid flightFound shelter on a towering height,And all the band with one accordWere closely gathered round their lord.Their course the same, with desperate leapEach made his way from steep to steep,And speeding on in wild careerFilled every height with sudden fear.Each heart was struck with mortal dread,As on their course the Vánars sped,While trees that crowned the steep were bentAnd crushed beneath them as they went.As in their eager flight they pressedFor safety to each mountain crest,The wild confusion struck with fearTiger and cat and wandering deer.The lords who watched Sugríva willWere gathered on the royal hill,And all with reverent hands upraisedUpon their king and leader gazed.Sugríva feared some evil planned,Some train prepared by Báli hand.But, skilled in words that charm and teach,Thus Hanumán(538) began his speech:\"Dismiss, dismiss thine idle fear,Nor dread the power of Báli here.For this is Malaya glorious hill(539)Where Báli might can work no ill.I look around but nowhere seeThe hated foe who made thee flee,Fell Báli, fierce in form and face:Then fear not, lord of Vánar race.Alas, in thee I clearly findThe weakness of the Vánar kind,That loves from thought to thought to range,Fix no belief and welcome change.Mark well each hint and sign and scan,Discreet and wise, thine every plan.How may a king, with sense denied,The subjects of his sceptre guide?\"Hanúmán,(540) wise in hour of need,Urged on the chief his prudent rede.His listening ear Sugríva bent,And spake in words more excellent:\"Where is the dauntless heart that freeFrom terror chilling touch can seeTwo stranger warriors, strong as those,Equipped with swords and shafts and bows,With mighty arms and large full eyes,Like glorious children of the skies?Báli my foe, I ween, has sentThese chiefs to aid his dark intent.Hence doubt and fear disturb me still,For thousands serve a monarch will,In borrowed garb they come, and thoseWho walk disguised are counted foes.With secret thoughts they watch their time,And wound fond hearts that fear no crime.My foe in state affairs is wise,And prudent kings have searching eyes.By other hands they strike the foe:By meaner tools the truth they know.Now to those stranger warriors turn,And, less than king, their purpose learn.Mark well the trick and look of each;Observe his form and note his speech.With care their mood and temper sound,And, if their minds be friendly found,With courteous looks and words beginTheir confidence and love to win.Then as my friend and envoy speak,And question what the strangers seek.Ask why equipped with shaft and bowThrough this wild maze of wood they go.If they, O chief, at first appearPure of all guile, in heart sincere,Detect in speech and look the sinAnd treachery that lurk within.\"He spoke: the Wind-God son obeyed.With ready zeal he sought the shade,And reached with hasty steps the woodWhere Raghu son and Lakshman stood.(541)Canto III. Hanumán Speech.The envoy in his faithful breastPondered Sugríva high behest.From Rishyamúka peak he hiedAnd placed him by the princes\\' side.The Wind-God son with cautious artHad laid his Vánar form apart,And wore, to cheat the strangers eyes,A wandering mendicant disguise.(542)Before the heroes\\' feet he bentAnd did obeisance reverent,And spoke, the glorious pair to praise,His words of truth in courteous phrase,High honour duly paid, the bestOf all the Vánar kind addressed,With free accord and gentle grace,Those glories of their warrior race:\"O hermits, blest in vows, who shineLike royal saints or Gods divine,O best of young ascetics, sayHow to this spot you found your way,Scaring the troops of wandering deerAnd silvan things that harbour hereSearching amid the trees that growWhere Pampá gentle waters flow.And lending from your brows a gleamOf glory to the lovely stream.Who are you, say, so brave and fair,Clad in the bark which hermits wear?I see you heave the frequent sigh,I see the deer before you fly.While you, for strength and valour dread,The earth, like lordly lions, tread,Each bearing in his hand a bow,Like Indra own, to slay the foe.With the grand paces of a bull,So bright and young and beautiful.The mighty arms you raise appearLike trunks which elephants uprear,And as you move this mountain-king(543)Is glorious with the light you bring.How have you reached, like Gods in face,Best lords of earth, this lonely place,With tresses coiled in hermit guise,(544)And splendours of those lotus eyes?As Gods who leave their heavenly sphere,Alike your beauteous forms appear.The Lords of Day and Night(545) might thusStray from the skies to visit us.Heroic youth, so broad of chest,Fair with the beauty of the Blest,With lion shoulders, tall and strong,Like bulls who lead the lowing throng,Your arms, unmatched for grace and length,With massive clubs may vie in strength.Why do no gauds those limbs adornWhere priceless gems were meetly worn?Each noble youth is fit, I deem,To guard this earth, as lord supreme,With all her woods and seas, to reignFrom Meru peak to Vindhya chain.Your smooth bows decked with dyes and goldAre glorious in their masters\\' hold,And with the arms of Indra(546) vieWhich diamond splendours beautify.Your quivers glow with golden sheen,Well stored with arrows fleet and keen,Each gleaming like a fiery snakeThat joys the foeman life to take.As serpents cast their sloughs awayAnd all their new born sheen display,So flash your mighty swords inlaidWith burning gold on hilt and blade.Why are you silent, heroes? WhyMy questions hear nor deign reply?Sugríva, lord of virtuous mind,The foremost of the Vánar kind,An exile from his royal state,Roams through the land disconsolate.I, Hanumán, of Vánar race,Sent by the king have sought this place,For he, the pious, just, and true,In friendly league would join with you.Know, godlike youths, that I am oneOf his chief lords, the Wind-God son.With course unchecked I roam at will,And now from Rishyamúka hill,To please his heart, his hope to speed,I came disguised in beggar weed.\"Thus Hanúmán, well trained in loreOf language, spoke, and said no more.The son of Raghu joyed to hearThe envoy speech, and bright of cheerHe turned to Lakshman by his side,And thus in words of transport cried:\"The counselor we now beholdOf King Sugríva righteous-souled.His face I long have yearned to see,And now his envoy comes to meWith sweetest words in courteous phraseAnswer this mighty lord who slaysHis foemen, by Sugríva sent,This Vánar chief most eloquent.For one whose words so sweetly flowThe whole Rig-veda(547) needs must know,And in his well-trained memory storeThe Yajush and the Sáman lore.He must have bent his faithful earAll grammar varied rules to hear.For his long speech how well he spoke!In all its length no rule he broke.In eye, on brow, in all his faceThe keenest look no guile could trace.No change of hue, no pose of limbGave sign that aught was false in him.Concise, unfaltering, sweet and clear,Without a word to pain the ear.From chest to throat, nor high nor low,His accents came in measured flow.How well he spoke with perfect artThat wondrous speech that charmed the heart,With finest skill and order gracedIn words that knew nor pause nor haste!That speech, with consonants that springFrom the three seats of uttering,(548)Would charm the spirit of a foeWhose sword is raised for mortal blow.How may a ruler plan succeedWho lacks such envoy good at need?How fail, if one whose mind is storedWith gifts so rare assist his lord?What plans can fail, with wisest speechOf envoy lips to further each?\"Thus Ráma spoke; and Lakshman taughtIn all the art that utters thought,To King Sugríva learned spyThus made his eloquent reply:\"Full well we know the gifts that graceSugríva, lord of Vánar race,And hither turn our wandering feetThat we that high-souled king may meet.So now our pleasant task shall beTo do the words he speaks by thee.\"His prudent speech the Vánar heard,And all his heart with joy was stirred.And hope that league with them would bringRedress and triumph to his king.Canto IV. Lakshman Reply.Cheered by the words that Ráma spoke,Joy in the Vánar breast awoke,And, as his friendly mood he knew,His thoughts to King Sugríva flew:\"Again,\" he mused, \"my high-souled lordShall rule, to kingly state restored;Since one so mighty comes to save,And freely gives the help we crave.\"Then joyous Hanumán, the bestOf all the Vánar kind, addressedThese words to Ráma, trained of yoreIn all the arts of speakers\\' lore:(549)\"Why do your feet this forest treadBy silvan life inhabited,This awful maze of tree and thornWhich Pampá flowering groves adorn?\"He spoke: obedient to the eyeOf Ráma, Lakshman made reply,The name and fortune to unfoldOf Raghu son the lofty-souled:\"True to the law, of fame unstained,The glorious Dasaratha reigned,And, steadfast in his duty, longKept the four castes(550) from scathe and wrong.Through his wide realm his will was done,And, loved by all, he hated none.Just to each creature great and small,Like the Good Sire he cared for all.The Ágnishtom,(551) as priests advised,And various rites he solemnized,Where ample largess ever paidThe Bráhmans for their holy aid.Here Ráma stands, his heir by birth,Whose name is glorious in the earth:Sure refuge he of all oppressed,Most faithful to his sire behest.He, Dasaratha eldest bornWhom gifts above the rest adorn,Lord of each high imperial sign,(552)The glory of his kingly line,Reft of his right, expelled from home,Came forth with me the woods to roam.And Sítá too, his faithful dame,Forth with her virtuous husband came,Like the sweet light when day is doneStill cleaving to her lord the sun.And me his sweet perfections drewTo follow as his servant true.Named Lakshman, brother of my lordOf grateful heart with knowledge storedMost meet is he all bliss to share,Who makes the good of all his care.While, power and lordship cast away,In the wild wood he chose to stay,A giant came,--his name unknown,--And stole the princess left alone.Then Diti son(553) who, cursed of yore,The semblance of a Rákshas wore,To King Sugríva bade us turnThe robber name and home to learn.For he, the Vánar chief, would knowThe dwelling of our secret foe.Such words of hope spake Diti son,And sought the heaven his deeds had won.Thou hast my tale. From first to lastThine ears have heard whate\\'er has past.Ráma the mighty lord and IFor refuge to Sugríva fly.The prince whose arm bright glory gained,O\\'er the whole earth as monarch reigned,And richest gifts to others gave,Is come Sugríva help to crave;Son of a king the surest friendOf virtue, him who loved to lendHis succour to the suffering weak,Is come Sugríva aid to seek.Yes, Raghu son whose matchless handProtected all this sea-girt land,The virtuous prince, my holy guide,For refuge seeks Sugríva side.His favour sent on great and smallShould ever save and prosper all.He now to win Sugríva graceHas sought his woodland dwelling-place.Son of a king of glorious fame;--Who knows not Dasaratha name?--From whom all princes of the earthReceived each honour due to worth;--Heir of that best of earthly kings,Ráma the prince whose glory ringsThrough realms below and earth and skies,For refuge to Sugríva flies.Nor should the Vánar king refuseThe boon for which the suppliant sues,But with his forest legions speedTo save him in his utmost need.\"Sumitrá son, his eyes bedewedWith piteous tears, thus sighed and sued.Then, trained in all the arts that guideThe speaker, Hanumán replied:\"Yea, lords like you of wisest thought,Whom happy fate has hither brought,Who vanquish ire and rule each sense,Must of our lord have audience.Reft of his kingdom, sad, forlorn,Once Báli hate now Báli scorn,Defeated, severed from his spouse,Wandering under forest boughs,Child of the Sun, our lord and kingSugríva will his succours bring,And all our Vánar hosts combinedWill trace the dame you long to find.\"With gentle tone and winning graceThus spake the chief of Vánar race,And then to Raghu son he cried:\"Come, haste we to Sugríva side.\"He spoke, and for his words so sweetGood Lakshman paid all honour meet;Then turned and cried to Raghu son:\"Now deem thy task already done,Because this chief of Vánar kind,Son of the God who rules the wind,Declares Sugríva self would beAssisted in his need by thee.Bright gleams of joy his cheek o\\'erspreadAs each glad word of hope he said;And ne\\'er will one so valiant deignTo cheer our hearts with hope in vain.\"He spoke, and Hanumán the wiseCast off his mendicant disguise,And took again his Vánar form,Son of the God of wind and storm.High on his ample back in hasteRaghu heroic sons he placed,And turned with rapid steps to findThe sovereign of the Vánar kind.Canto V. The League.From Rishyamúka rugged sideTo Malaya hill the Vánar hied,And to his royal chieftain thereAnnounced the coming of the pair:\"See, here with Lakshman Ráma standsIllustrious in a hundred lands.Whose valiant heart will never quailAlthough a thousand foes assail;King Dasaratha son, the graceAnd glory of Ikshváku race.Obedient to his father willHe cleaves to sacred duty still.With rites of royal pomp and prideHis sire the Fire-God gratified;Ten hundred thousand kine he freed,And priests enriched with ample meed;And the broad land protected, famedFor truthful lips and passions tamed.Through woman guile his son has madeHis dwelling in the forest shade,Where, as he lived with every senseSubdued in hermit abstinence,Fierce Rávan stole his wife, and heIs come a suppliant, lord, to thee.Now let all honour due be paidTo these great chiefs who seek thine aid.\"Thus spake the Vánar prince, and, stirredWith friendly thoughts, Sugríva heard.The light of joy his face o\\'erspread,And thus to Raghu son he said:\"O Prince, in rules of duty trained,Caring for all with love unfeigned,Hanúmán tongue has truly shownThe virtues that are thine alone.My chiefest glory, gain, and bliss,O stranger Prince, I reckon this,That Raghu son will condescendTo seek the Vánar for his friend.If thou my true ally wouldst beAccept the pledge I offer thee,This hand in sign of friendship take,And bind the bond we ne\\'er will break.\"He spoke, and joy thrilled Ráma breast;Sugríva hand he seized and pressedAnd, transport beaming from his eye,Held to his heart his new ally.In wanderer weed disguised no more,His proper form Hanúmán wore.Then, wood with wood engendering,(554) cameNeath his deft hands the kindled flame.Between the chiefs that fire he placedWith wreaths of flowers and worship graced.And round its blazing glory wentThe friends with slow steps reverent.Thus each to other pledged and boundIn solemn league new transport found,And bent upon his dear allyThe gaze he ne\\'er could satisfy.\"Friend of my soul art thou: we shareEach other joy, each other care;\"Thus in the bliss that thrilled his breastSugríva Raghu son addressed.From a high Sál a branch he toreWhich many a leaf and blossom bore,And the fine twigs beneath them laidA seat for him and Ráma made.Then Hanumán with joyous mind,Son of the God who rules the wind,To Lakshman gave, his seat to be,The gay branch of a Sandal tree.Then King Sugríva with his eyesStill trembling with the sweet surpriseOf the great joy he could not hide,To Raghu noblest scion cried:\"O Ráma, racked with woe and fear,Spurned by my foes, I wander here.Reft of my spouse, forlorn I dwellHere in my forest citadel.Or wild with terror and distressRoam through the distant wilderness.Vext by my brother Báli longMy soul has borne the scathe and wrong.Do thou, whose virtues all revere,Release me from my woe and fear.From dire distress thy friend to freeIs a high task and worthy thee.\"He spoke, and Raghu son who knewAll sacred duties men should do.The friend of justice, void of guile,Thus answered with a gentle smile:\"Great Vánar, friends who seek my aidStill find their trust with fruit repaid.Báli, thy foe, who stole awayThy wife this vengeful hand shall slay.These shafts which sunlike flash and burn,Winged with the feathers of the hern,Each swift of flight and sure and dread,With even knot and pointed head,Fierce as the crashing fire-bolt sentBy him who rules the firmament,(555)Shall reach thy wicked foe and likeInfuriate serpents hiss and strike.Thou, Vánar King, this day shalt seeThe foe who long has injured theeLie, like a shattered mountain, low,Slain by the tempest of my bow.\"Thus Ráma spake: Sugríva heard,And mighty joy his bosom stirred:As thus his champion he addressed:\"Now by thy favour, first and bestOf heroes, shall thy friend obtainHis realm and darling wife againRecovered from the foe.Check thou mine elder brother might;That ne\\'er again his deadly spiteMay rob me of mine ancient right,Or vex my soul with woe.\"The league was struck, a league to bringTo Sítá fiends, and Vánar king(556)Apportioned bliss and bale.Through her left eye quick throbbings shot,(557)Glad signs the lady doubted not,That told their hopeful tale.The bright left eye of Báli feltAn inauspicious throb that dealtA deadly blow that day.The fiery left eyes of the crewOf demons felt the throb, and knewThe herald of dismay.Canto VI. The Tokens.With joy that sprang from hope restoredTo Ráma spake the Vánar lord:\"I know, by wise Hanúmán taught,Why thou the lonely wood hast sought.Where with thy brother Lakshman thouHast sojourned, bound by hermit vow;Have heard how Sítá, Janak child,Was stolen in the pathless wild,How by a roving Rákshas sheWeeping was reft from him and thee;How, bent on death, the giant slewThe vulture king, her guardian true,And gave thy widowed breast to knowA solitary mourner woe.But soon, dear Prince, thy heart shall beFrom every trace of sorrow free;For I thy darling will restore,Lost like the prize of holy lore.(558)Yea, though in heaven the lady dwell,Or prisoned in the depths of hell,My friendly care her way shall trackAnd bring thy ransomed darling back.Let this my promise soothe thy care,Nor doubt the words I truly swear.Saints, fiends, and dwellers of the skiesShall find thy wife a bitter prize,Like the rash child who rues too lateThe treacherous lure of poisoned cate.No longer, Prince, thy loss deplore:Thy darling wife will I restore.\\'Twas she I saw: my heart infersThat shrinking form was doubtless hers,Which gaint Rávan, fierce and dread,Bore swiftly through the clouds o\\'erheadStill writhing in his strict embraceLike helpless queen of serpent race,(559)And from her lips that sad voice cameShrieking thine own and Lakshman name.High on a hill she saw me standWith comrades twain on either hand.Her outer robe to earth she threw,And with it sent her anklets too.We saw the glittering tokens fall,We found them there and kept them all.These will I bring: perchance thine eyesThe treasured spoils will recognize.\"He ceased: then Raghu son repliedTo the glad tale, and eager cried:\"Bring them with all thy speed: delayNo more, dear friend, but haste away.\"Thus Ráma spoke. Sugríva hiedWithin the mountain caverned side,Impelled by love that stirred each thoughtThe precious tokens quickly brought,And said to Raghu son: BeholdThis garment and these rings of gold.In Ráma hand with friendly hasteThe jewels and the robe he placed.Then, like the moon by mist assailed,The tear-dimmed eyes of Ráma failed;That burst of woe unmanned his frame,Woe sprung from passion for his dame,And with his manly strength o\\'erthrown,He fell and cried, Ah me! mine own!Again, again close to his breastThe ornaments and robe he pressed,While the quick pants that shook his frameAs from a furious serpent came.On his dear brother standing nighHe turned at length his piteous eye;And, while his tears increasing ran,In bitter wail he thus began:\"Look, brother, and behold once moreThe ornaments and robe she wore,Dropped while the giant bore awayIn cruel arras his struggling prey,Dropped in some quiet spot, I ween,Where the young grass was soft and green;For still untouched by spot or stainTheir former beauty all retain.\"He spoke with many a tear and sigh,And thus his brother made reply:\"The bracelets thou hast fondly shown,And earrings, are to me unknown,But by long service taught I greetThe anklets of her honoured feet.\"(560)Then to Sugríva Ráma, bestOf Raghu sons, these words addressed:\"Say to what quarter of the skyThe cruel fiend was seen to fly,Bearing afar my captured wife,My darling dearer than my life.Speak, Vánar King, that I may knowWhere dwells the cause of all my woe;The fiend for whose transgression allThe giants by this hand shall fall.He who the Maithil lady stoleAnd kindled fury in my soul,Has sought his fate in senseless prideAnd opened Death dark portal wide.Then tell me, Vánar lord, I pray,The dwelling of my foe,And he, beneath this hand, to-dayTo Yáma halls shall go.\"Canto VII. Ráma Consoled.With longing love and woe oppressedThe Vánar chief he thus addressed:And he, while sobs his utterance broke,Raised up his reverent hands and spoke:\"O Raghu son, I cannot tellWhere now that cruel fiend may dwell,Declare his power and might, or traceThe author of his cursed race.Still trust the promise that I makeAnd let thy breast no longer ache.So will I toil, nor toil in vain,That thou thy consort mayst regain.So will I work with might and skillThat joy anew thy heart shall fill:The valour of my soul display,And Rávan and his legions slay.Awake, awake! unmanned no moreRecall the strength was thine of yore.Beseems not men like thee to wearA weak heart yielding to despair.Like troubles, too, mine eyes have seen,Lamenting for a long-lost queen;But, by despair unconquered yet,My strength of mind I ne\\'er forget.Far more shouldst thou of lofty soulThy passion and thy tears control,When I, of Vánar humbler strain,Weep not for her in ceaseless pain.Be firm, be patient, nor forgetThe bounds the brave of heart have setIn loss, in woe, in strife, in fear,When the dark hour of death is near.Up! with thine own brave heart advise:Not thus despond the firm and wise.But he who gives his childish heartTo choose the coward weakling part,Sinks, like a foundered vessel, deepIn waves of woe that o\\'er him sweep.See, suppliant hand to hand I lay,And, moved by faithful love, I pray.Give way no more to grief and gloom,But all thy native strength resume.No joy on earth, I ween, have theyWho yield their souls to sorrow sway.Their glory fades in slow decline:\\'Tis not for thee to grieve and pine.I do but hint with friendly speechThe wiser part I dare not teach.This better path, dear friend, pursue,And let not grief thy soul subdue.\"Sugríva thus with gentle artAnd sweet words soothed the mourner heart,Who brushed off with his mantle hemTears from the eyes bedewed with them.Sugríva words were not in vain,And Ráma was himself again,Around the king his arms he threwAnd thus began his speech anew:\"Whate\\'er a friend most wise and true,Who counsels for the best, should do,Whate\\'er his gentle part should be,Has been performed, dear friend, by thee.Taught by thy counsel, O my lord,I feel my native strength restored.A friend like thee is hard to gain,Most rare in time of grief and pain.Now strain thine utmost power to traceThe Maithil lady dwelling place,And aid me in my search to findFierce Rávan of the impious mind.Trust thou, in turn, thy loyal friend,And say what aid this arm can lendTo speed thy hopes, as fostering rainQuickens in earth the scattered grain.Deem not those words, that seemed to springFrom pride, are false, O Vánar King.None from these lips has ever heard,None e\\'er shall hear, one lying word.Again I promise and declare,Yea, by my truth, dear friend, I swear.\"Then glad was King Sugríva breast,And all his lords their joy confessed,Stirred by sure hope of Ráma aid,And promise which the prince had made.Canto VIII. Ráma Promise.Doubt from Sugríva heart had fled,And thus to Raghu son he said:\"No bliss the Gods of heaven deny.Each views me with a favouring eye,When thou, whom all good gifts attend,Hast sought me and become my friend.Leagued, friend, with thee in bold empriseMy arm might win the conquered skies;And shall our banded strength be weakTo gain the realm which now I seek?A happy fate was mine aboveMy kith and kin and all I love,When, near the witness fire, I wonThy friendship, Raghu glorious son.Thou too in ripening time shall seeThy friend not all unworthy thee.What gifts I have shall thus be shown:Not mine the tongue to make them known.Strong is the changeless bond that bindsThe friendly faith of noble minds,In woe, in danger, firm and sureTheir constancy and love endure.Gold, silver, jewels rich and rareThey count as wealth for friends to share.Yea, be they rich or poor and low,Blest with all joys or sunk in woe,Stained with each fault or pure of blame,Their friends the nearest place may claim;For whom they leave, at friendship call,Their gold, their bliss, their homes and all.\"He spoke by generous impulse moved,And Raghu son his speech approvedGlancing at Lakshman by his side,Like Indra in his beauty pride.The Vánar monarch saw the pairOf mighty brothers standing there,And turned his rapid eye to viewThe forest trees that near him grew.He saw, not far from where he stood,A Sál tree towering o\\'er the wood.Amid the thick leaves many a beeGraced the scant blossoms of the tree,From whose dark shade a bough, that boreA load of leafy twigs, he tore,Which on the grassy ground he laidAnd seats for him and Ráma made.Hanúmán saw them sit, he soughtA Sál tree leafy bough and broughtThe burthen, and with meek requestEntreated Lakshman, too, to rest.There on the noble mountain brow,Strewn with the young leaves of the bough,Sat Raghu son in placid easeCalm as the sea when sleeps the breeze.Sugríva heart with rapture swelled,And thus, by eager love impelled,He spoke in gracious tone, that, oftChecked by his joy, was low and soft:\"I, by my brother might oppressed,By ceaseless woe and fear distressed,Mourning my consort far away,On Rishyamúka mountain stray.Expelled by Báli cruel hateI wander here disconsolate.Do thou to whom all sufferers flee,From his dread hand deliver me.\"He spoke, and Ráma, just and brave,Whose pious soul to virtue clave,Smiled as in conscious might he eyedThe king of Vánars, and replied:\"Best fruit of friendship is the deedThat helps the friend in hour of need;And this mine arm in death shall layThy robber ere the close of day.For see, these feathered darts of mineWhose points so fiercely flash and shine,And shafts with golden emblem, cameFrom dark woods known by Skanda name,(561)Winged from the pinion of the hernLike Indra bolts they strike and burn.With even knots and piercing headEach like a furious snake is sped;With these, to-day, before thine eyeShall, like a shattered mountain, lieBáli, thy dread and wicked foe,O\\'erwhelmed in hideous overthrow.\"He spoke: Sugríva bosom swelledWith hope and joy unparalleled.Then his glad voice the Vánar raised,And thus the son of Raghu praised:\"Long have I pined in depth of grief;Thou art the hope of all, O chief.Now, Raghu son, I hail thee friend,And bid thee to my woes attend;For, by my truth I swear it, nowNot life itself is dear as thou,Since by the witness fire we metAnd friendly hand in hand was set.Friend communes now with friend, and henceI tell with surest confidence,How woes that on my spirit weighConsume me through the night and day.\"For sobs and sighs he scarce could speak,And his sad voice came low and weak,As, while his eyes with tears o\\'erflowed,The burden of his soul he showed.Then by strong effort, bravely made,The torrent of his tears he stayed,Wiped his bright eyes, his grief subdued,And thus, more calm, his speech renewed:\"By Báli conquering might oppressed,Of power and kingship dispossessed,Loaded with taunts of scorn and hateI left my realm and royal state.He tore away my consort: sheWas dearer than my life to me,And many a friend to me and mineIn hopeless chains was doomed to pine.With wicked thoughts, unsated still,Me whom he wrongs he yearns to kill;And spies of Vánar race, who triedTo slay me, by this hand have died.Moved by this constant doubt and fearI saw thee, Prince, and came not near.When woe and peril gather roundA foe in every form is found.Save Hanumán, O Raghu son,And these, no friend is left me, none.Through their kind aid, a faithful bandWho guard their lord from hostile hand,Rest when their chieftain rests and bendTheir steps where\\'er he lists to wend,--Through them alone, in toil and pain,My wretched life I still sustain.Enough, for thou hast heard in briefThe story of my pain and grief.His mighty strength all regions know,My brother, but my deadly foe.Ah, if the proud oppressor fell,His death would all my woe dispel.Yea, on my cruel conqueror fallMy joy depends, my life, my all.This were the end and sure relief,O Ráma, of my tale of grief.Fair be his lot or dark with woe,No comfort like a friend I know.\"Then Ráma spoke: \"O friend, relateWhence sprang fraternal strife and hate,That duly taught by thee, I mayEach foeman strength and weakness weigh:And skilled in every chance restoreThe blissful state thou hadst before.For, when I think of all the scornAnd bitter woe thou long hast borne,My soul indignant swells with painLike waters flushed with furious rain.Then, ere I string this bended bow,Tell me the tale I long to know,Ere from the cord my arrow fly,And low in death thy foeman lie.\"He spoke: Sugríva joyed to hear,Nor less his lords were glad of cheer:And thus to Ráma mighty-souledThe cause that moved their strife he told:Canto IX. Sugríva Story.(562)\"My brother, known by Báli name,Had won by might a conqueror fame.My father eldest-born was he,Well honoured by his sire and me.My father died, and each sage lordNamed Báli king with one accord;And he, by right of birth ordained,The sovereign of the Vánars reigned.He in his royal place controlledThe kingdom of our sires of old,And I all faithful service lentTo aid my brother government.The fiend Máyáví,--him of yoreTo Dundubhi(563) his mother bore,--For woman love in strife engaged,A deadly war with Báli waged.When sleep had chained each weary frameTo vast Kishkindhá(564) gates he came,And, shouting through the shades of night,Challenged his foeman to the fight.My brother heard the furious shout,And wild with rage rushed madly out,Though fain would I and each sad wifeDetain him from the deadly strife.He burned his demon foe to slay,And rushed impetuous to the fray.His weeping wives he thrust aside,And forth, impelled by fury, hied;While, by my love and duty led,I followed where my brother sped.Máyáví looked, and at the sightFled from his foes in wild affright.The flying fiend we quickly viewed,And with swift feet his steps pursued.Then rose the moon, whose friendly rayCast light upon our headlong way.By the soft beams was dimly shownA mighty cave with grass o\\'ergrown.Within its depths he sprang, and weThe demon form no more might see.My brother breast was all aglowWith fury when he missed the foe,And, turning, thus to me he saidWith senses all disquieted:\"Here by the cavern mouth remain;Keep ear and eye upon the strain,While I the dark recess exploreAnd dip my brand in foeman gore.\"I heard his angry speech, and triedTo turn him from his plan aside.He made me swear by both his feet,And sped within the dark retreat.While in the cave he stayed, and IWatched at the mouth, a year went by.For his return I looked in vain,And, moved by love, believed him slain.I mourned, by doubt and fear distressed,And greater horror seized my breastWhen from the cavern rolled a flood,A carnage stream of froth and blood;And from the depths a sound of fear,The roar of demons, smote mine ear;But never rang my brother shoutTriumphant in the battle rout.I closed the cavern with a block,Huge as a hill, of shattered rock.Gave offerings due to Báli shade,And sought Kishkindhá, sore dismayed.Long time with anxious care I triedFrom Báli lords his fate to hide,But they, when once the tale was known,Placed me as king on Báli throne.There for a while I justly reignedAnd all with equal care ordained,When joyous from the demon slainMy brother Báli came again.He found me ruling in his stead,And, fired with rage, his eyes grew red.He slew the lords who made me king,And spoke keen words to taunt and sting.The kingly rank and power I heldMy brother rage with ease had quelled,But still, restrained by old respectFor claims of birth, the thought I checked.Thus having struck the demon downCame Báli to his royal town.With meek respect, with humble speech,His haughty heart I strove to reach.But all my arts were tried in vain,No gentle word his lips would deign,Though to the ground I bent and setHis feet upon my coronet:Still Báli in his rage and prideAll signs of grace and love denied.\"Canto X. Sugríva Story.\"I strove to soothe and lull to restThe fury of his troubled breast:\"Well art thou come, dear lord,\" I cried.\"By whose strong arm thy foe has died.Forlorn I languished here, but nowMy saviour and defence art thou.Once more receive this regal shade(565)Like the full moon in heaven displayed;And let the chouries,(566) thus restored,Wave glorious o\\'er the rightful lord.I kept my watch, thy word obeyed,And by the cave a year I stayed.But when I saw that stream of bloodRush from the cavern in a flood,My sad heart broken with dismay,And every wandering sense astray,I barred the entrance with a stone,--A crag from some high mountain thrown--Turned from the spot I watched in vain,And to Kishkindhá came again.My deep distress and downcast mienBy citizen and lord were seen.They made me king against my will:Forgive me if the deed was ill.True as I ever was I seeMy honoured king once more in thee;I only ruled a while the stateWhen thou hadst left us desolate.This town with people, lords, and lands,Lay as a trust in guardian hands:And now, my gracious lord, acceptThe kingdom which thy servant kept.Forgive me, victor of the foe,Nor let thy wrath against me glow.See joining suppliant hands I pray,And at thy feet my head I lay.Believe my words: against my willThe royal seat they made me fill.Unkinged they saw the city, henceThey made me lord for her defence.\"But Báli, though I humbly sued,Reviled me in his furious mood:\"Out on thee, wretch!\" in wrath he criedWith many a bitter taunt beside.He summoned every lord, and allHis subjects gathered at his call.Then forth his burning anger broke,And thus amid his friends he spoke:\"I need not tell, for well ye know,How fierce Máyáví, fiend and foe,Came to Kishkindhá gate by night,And dared me in his wrath to fight.I heard each word the demon said:Forth from my royal hall I sped;And, foe in brother guise concealed,Sugríva followed to the field.The mighty demon through the shadeBeheld me come with one to aid:Then shrinking from unequal fight,He turned his back in swiftest flight.From vengeful foes his life to saveHe sought the refuge of a cave.Then when I saw the fiend had fledWithin that cavern dark and dread,Thus to my brother cruel-eyed,Impatient in my wrath, I cried:\"I seek no more my royal townTill I have struck the demon down.Here by the cavern mouth remainUntil my hand the foe have slain.\"Upon his faith my heart relied,And swift within the depths I hied.A year went by: in every spotI sought the fiend, but found him not.At length my foe I saw and slew,Whom long I feared when lost to view;And all his kinsmen by his sideBeneath my vengeful fury died.The monster, as he reeled and fell,Poured forth his blood with roar and yell;And, filling all the cavern, dyedThe portal with the crimson tide.Upon my foeman slain at lastOne look, one pitying look, I cast.I sought again the light of day:The cave was closed and left no way.To the barred mouth I sadly came,And called aloud Sugríva name.But all was still: no voice replied,And hope within my bosom died.With furious efforts, vain at first,Through bars of rock my way I burst.Then, free once more, the path that broughtMy feet in safety home I sought.\\'Twas thus Sugríva dared despiseThe claim of brothers\\' friendly ties.With crags of rock he barred me in,And for himself the realm would win.\"Thus Báli spoke in words severe;And then, unmoved by ruth or fear,Left me a single robe and sentHis brother forth in banishment.He cast me out with scathe and scorn,And from my side my wife was torn.Now in great fear and ill at easeI roam this land with woods and seas,Or dwell on Rishyamúka hill,And sorrow for my consort still.Thou hast the tale how first aroseThis bitter hate of brother foes.Such are the griefs neath which I pine,And all without a fault of mine.O swift to save in hour of fear,My prayer who dread this Báli, hearWith gracious love assistance deign,And mine oppressor arm restrain.\"Then Raghu son, the good and brave,With a gay laugh his answer gave:\"These shafts of mine which ne\\'er can fail,Before whose sheen the sun grows pale,Winged by my fury, fleet and fierce,The wicked Báli heart shall pierce.Yea, mark the words I speak, so longShall live that wretch who joys in wrong,Until these angered eyes have seenThe robber of thy darling queen.I, taught by equal suffering, knowWhat waves of grief above thee flow.This hand thy captive wife shall free,And give thy kingdom back to thee.\"Sugríva joyed as Ráma spoke,And valour in his breast awoke.His eye grew bright, his heart grew bold,And thus his wondrous tale he told:Canto XI. Dundubhi.\"I doubt not, Prince, thy peerless might,Armed with these shafts so keen and bright,Like all-destroying fires of fate,The worlds could burn and devastate.But lend thou first thy mind and earOf Báli power and might to hear.How bold, how firm, in battle tried,Is Báli heart; and then decide.From east to west, from south to northOn restless errand hurrying forth,From farthest sea to sea he fliesBefore the sun has lit the skies.A mountain top he oft will seek,Tear from its root a towering peak,Hurl it aloft, as \\'twere a ball,And catch it ere to earth it fall.And many a tree that long has stoodIn health and vigour in the wood,His single arm to earth will throw,The marvels of his might to show.Shaped like a bull, a monster boreThe name of Dundubhi of yore:He matched in size a mountain height,A thousand elephants in might.By pride of wondrous gifts impelled,And strength he deemed unparalleled,To Ocean, lord of stream and brook,Athirst for war, his way he took.He reached the king of rolling wavesWhose gems are piled in sunless caves,And threw his challenge to the sea;\"Come forth, O King, and fight with me.\"He spoke, and from his ocean bedThe righteous(567) monarch heaved his head,And gave, sedate, his calm replyTo him whom fate impelled to die:\"Not mine, not mine the power,\" he cried,\"To cope with thee in battle tried;But listen to my voice, and seekThe worthier foe of whom I speak.The Lord of Hills, where hermits liveAnd love the home his forests give,Whose child is Sankar darling queen,(568)The King of Snows is he I mean.Deep caves has he, and dark boughs shadeThe torrent and the wild cascade.From him expect the fierce delightWhich heroes feel in equal fight.\"He deemed that fear checked ocean king,And, like an arrow from the string,To the wild woods that clothe the sideOf Lord Himálaya hills he hied.Then Dundubhi, with hideous roar,Huge fragments from the summit toreVast as Airávat,(569) white with snow,And hurled them to the plains below.Then like a white cloud soft, serene,The Lord of Mountains\\' form was seen.It sat upon a lofty crest,And thus the furious fiend addressed:\"Beseems thee not, O virtue friend,My mountain tops to rive and rend;For I, the hermit calm retreat,For deeds of war am all unmeet.\"The demon eye with rage grew red,And thus in furious tone he said:\"If thou from fear or sloth declineTo match thy strength in war with mine,Where shall I find a champion, say,To meet me burning for the fray?\"He spoke: Himálaya, skilled in loreOf eloquence, replied once more,And, angered in his righteous mind,Addressed the chief of demon kind:\"The Vánar Báli, brave and wise,Son of the God who rules the skies,(570)Sways, glorious in his high renown,Kishkindhá his imperial town.Well may that valiant lord who knowsEach art of war his might opposeTo thine, in equal battle set,As Namuehi(571) and Indra met.Go, if thy soul desire the fray;To Báli city speed away,And that unconquered hero meetWhose fame is high for warlike feat.\"He listened to the Lord of Snow,And, his proud heart with rage aglow,Sped swift away and lighted downBy vast Kishkindhá, Báli town.With pointed horns to strike and goreThe semblance of a bull he bore,Huge as a cloud that downward bendsEre the full flood of rain descends.Impelled by pride and rage and hate,He thundered at Kishkindhá gate;And with his bellowing, like the soundOf pealing drums, he shook the ground,He rent the earth and prostrate threwThe trees that near the portal grew.King Báli from the bowers withinIndignant heard the roar and din.Then, moonlike mid the stars, with allHis dames he hurried to the wall;And to the fiend this speech, expressedIn clear and measured words, addressed:\"Know me for monarch. Báli styled,Of Vánar tribes that roam the wild.Say why dost thou this gate molest,And bellowing thus disturb our rest?I know thee, mighty fiend: bewareAnd guard thy life with wiser care.\"He spoke: and thus the fiend returned,While red with rage his eyeballs burned:\"What! speak when all thy dames are nighAnd hero-like thy foe defy?Come, meet me in the fight this day,And learn my strength by bold assay.Or shall I spare thee, and relentUntil the coming night be spent?Take then the respite of a nightAnd yield thee to each soft delight.Then, monarch of the Vánar raceWith loving arms thy friends embrace.Gifts on thy faithful lords bestow,Bid each and all farewell, and go.Show in the streets once more thy face,Install thy son to fill thy place.Dally a while with each dear dame;And then my strength thy pride shall tameFor, should I smite thee drunk with wineEnamoured of those dames of thine,Beneath diseases bowed and bent,Or weak, unarmed, or negligent,My deed would merit hate and scornAs his who slays the child unborn.\"Then Báli soul with rage was fired,Queen Tára and the dames retired;And slowly, with a laugh of pride,The king of Vánars thus replied:\"Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:Unless thy fear the fight decline,Come, meet me in the fray, and testThe spirit of my valiant breast.\"He spoke in wrath and high disdain;And, laying down his golden chain,Gift of his sire Mahendra, daredThe demon, for the fray prepared;Seized by the horns the monster, vastAs a huge hill, and held him fast,Then fiercely dragged him round and round,And, shouting, hurled him to the ground.Blood streaming from his ears, he rose,And wild with fury strove the foes.Then Báli, match for Indra might,With every arm renewed the fight.He fought with fists, and feet, and knees,With fragments of the rock, and trees.At last the monster strength, assailedBy Sakra(572) conquering offspring, failed.Him Báli raised with mighty strainAnd dashed upon the ground again;Where, bruised and shattered, in a tideOf rushing blood, the demon died.King Báli saw the lifeless corse,And bending, with tremendous forceRaised the huge bulk from where it lay,And hurled it full a league away.As through the air the body flew,Some blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,Welled from his shattered jaw and fellBy Saint Matanga hermit cell:Matanga saw, illustrious sage,Those drops defile his hermitage,And, as he marvelled whence they came,Fierce anger filled his soul with flame:\"Who is the villain, evil-souled,With childish thoughts unwise and bold,Who is the impious wretch,\" he cried,\"By whom my grove with blood is dyed?\"Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,And hastened from the hermitage,When lo, before his wondering eyesLay the dead bull of mountain size.His hermit soul was nothing slowThe doer of the deed to know,And thus the Vánar in a burstOf wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:\"Ne\\'er let that Vánar wander here,For, if he come, his death is near,Whose impious hand with blood has dyedThe holy place where I abide,Who threw this demon corse and madeA ruin of the pleasant shade.If e\\'er he plant his wicked feetWithin one league of my retreat;Yea, if the villain come so nighThat very hour he needs must die.And let the Vánar lords who dwellIn the dark woods that skirt my cellObey my words, and speeding henceFind them some meeter residence.Here if they dare to stay, on allThe terrors of my curse shall fall.They spoil the tender saplings, dearAs children which I cherish here,Mar root and branch and leaf and spray,And steal the ripening fruit away.One day I grant, no further hour,To-morrow shall my curse have power,And then each Vánar I may seeA stone through countless years shall be.\"The Vánars heard the curse and hiedFrom sheltering wood and mountain side.King Báli marked their haste and dread,And to the flying leaders said:\"Speak, Vánar chiefs, and tell me whyFrom Saint Matanga grove ye flyTo gather round me: is it wellWith all who in those woodlands dwell?\"He spoke: the Vánar leaders toldKing Báli with his chain of goldWhat curse the saint had on them laid,Which drove them from their ancient shade.Then royal Báli sought the sage,With reverent hands to soothe his rage.The holy man his suppliant spurned,And to his cell in anger turned.That curse on Báli sorely pressed,And long his conscious soul distressed.Him still the curse and terror keepAfar from Rishyamúka steep.He dares not to the grove draw nigh,Nay scarce will hither turn his eye.We know what terrors warm him hence,And roam these woods in confidence.Look, Prince, before thee white and dryThe demon bones uncovered lie,Who, like a hill in bulk and length,Fell ruind for his pride of strength.See those high Sál trees seven in rowThat droop their mighty branches low,These at one grasp would Báli seize,And leafless shake the trembling trees.These tales I tell, O Prince, to showThe matchless power that arms the foe.How canst thou hope to slay him? howMeet Báli in the battle now?\"Sugríva spoke and sadly sighed:And Lakshman with a laugh replied:\"What show of power, what proof and testMay still the doubts that fill thy breast?\"He spoke. Sugríva thus replied:\"See yonder Sál trees side by side.King Báli here would take his standGrasping his bow with vigorous hand,And every arrow, keen and true,Would strike its tree and pierce it through.If Ráma now his bow will bend,And through one trunk an arrow send;Or if his arm can raise and throwTwo hundred measures of his bow,Grasped by a foot and hurled through air,The demon bull that moulders there,My heart will own his might and fainBelieve my foe already slain.\"Sugríva spoke inflamed with ire,Scanned Ráma with a glance of fire,Pondered a while in silent mood.And thus again his speech renewed:\"All lands with Báli glories ring,A valiant, strong, and mighty king;In conscious power unused to yield,A hero first in every field.His wondrous deeds his might declare,Deeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;And on this power reflecting stillI roam on Rishyamúka hill.Awed by my brother might I rove,In doubt and fear, from grove to grove,While Hanumán, my chosen friend,And faithful lords my steps attend;And now, O true to friendship tie,I hail in thee my best ally.My surest refuge from my foes,And steadfast as the Lord of Snows.Still, when I muse how strong and boldIs cruel Báli, evil-souled,But ne\\'er, O chief of Raghu line,Have seen what strength in war is thine,Though in my heart I may not dareDoubt thy great might, despise, compare,Thoughts of his fearful deeds will riseAnd fill my soul with sad surmise.Speech, form, and trust which naught may moveThy secret strength and glory prove,As smouldering ashes dimly showThe dormant fires that live below.\"He ceased: and Ráma answered, whilePlayed o\\'er his lips a gracious smile:\"Not yet convinced? This clear assayShall drive each lingering doubt away.\"Thus Ráma spoke his heart to cheer,To Dundubhi vast frame drew near:He touched it with his foot in playAnd sent it twenty leagues away.Sugríva marked what easy forceHurled through the air that demon corseWhose mighty bones were white and dried,And to the son of Raghu cried:\"My brother Báli, when his mightWas drunk and weary from the fight,Hurled forth the monster body, freshWith skin and sinews, blood and flesh.Now flesh and blood are dried away,The crumbling bones are light as hay,Which thou, O Raghu son, hast sentFlying through air in merriment.This test alone is weak to showIf thou be stronger or the foe.By thee a heap of mouldering bone,By him the recent corse was thrown.Thy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:Come, pierce one tree: let this decide.Prepare thy ponderous bow and bringClose to thine ear the straining string.On yonder Sál tree fix thine eye,And let the mighty arrow fly,I doubt not, chief, that I shall seeThy pointed shaft transfix the tree.Then come, assay the easy task,And do for love the thing I ask.Best of all lights, the Day-God fillsWith glory earth and sky:Himálaya is the lord of hillsThat heave their heads on high.The royal lion is the bestOf beasts that tread the earth;And thou, O hero, art confessedFirst in heroic worth.\"Canto XII. The Palm Trees.Then Ráma, that his friend might knowHis strength unrivalled, grasped his bow,That mighty bow the foe dismay,--And on the string an arrow lay.Next on the tree his eye he bent,And forth the hurtling weapon went.Loosed from the matchless hero hold,That arrow, decked with burning gold,Cleft the seven palms in line, and throughThe hill that rose behind them flew:Six subterranean realms it passed,And reached the lowest depth at last,Whence speeding back through earth and airIt sought the quiver, and rested there.(573)Upon the cloven trees amazed,The sovereign of the Vánars gazed.With all his chains and gold outspreadProstrate on earth he laid his head.Then, rising, palm to palm he laidIn reverent act, obeisance made,And joyously to Ráma, bestOf war-trained chiefs, these words addressed:\"What champion, Raghu son, may hopeWith thee in deadly fight to cope,Whose arrow, leaping from the bow,Cleaves tree and hill and earth below?Scarce might the Gods, arrayed for strifeBy Indra self, escape, with lifeAssailed by thy victorious hand:And how may Báli hope to stand?All grief and care are past away,And joyous thoughts my bosom sway,Who have in thee a friend, renowned,As Varun(574) or as Indra, found.Then on! subdue,--\\'tis friendship claim,--My foe who bears a brother name.Strike Báli down beneath thy feet:With suppliant hands I thus entreat.\"Sugríva ceased, and Ráma pressedThe grateful Vánar to his breast;And thoughts of kindred feeling wokeIn Lakshman bosom, as he spoke:\"On to Kishkindhá, on with speed!Thou, Vánar King, our way shalt lead,Then challenge Báli forth to fight.Thy foe who scorns a brother right.\"They sought Kishkindhá gate and stoodConcealed by trees in densest wood,Sugríva, to the fight addressed,More closely drew his cinctured vest,And raised a wild sky-piercing shoutTo call the foeman Báli out.Forth came impetuous Báli, stirredTo fury by the shout he heard.So the great sun, ere night has ceased,Springs up impatient to the east.Then fierce and wild the conflict ragedAs hand to hand the foes engaged,As though in battle mid the starsFought Mercury and fiery Mars.(575)To highest pitch of frenzy wroughtWith fists like thunderbolts they fought,While near them Ráma took his stand,And viewed the battle, bow in hand.Alike they stood in form and might,Like heavenly Asvins(576) paired in fight,Nor might the son of Raghu knowWhere fought the friend and where the foe;So, while his bow was ready bent,No life-destroying shaft he sent.Crushed down by Báli mightier strokeSugríva force now sank and broke,Who, hoping naught from Ráma aid,To Rishyamúka fled dismayed,Weary, and faint, and wounded sore,His body bruised and dyed with gore,From Báli blows, in rage and dread,Afar to sheltering woods he fled.Nor Báli farther dared pursue,The curbing curse too well he knew.\"Fled from thy death!\" the victor cried,And home the mighty warrior hied.Hanúmán, Lakshman, Raghu sonBeheld the conquered Vánar run,And followed to the sheltering shadeWhere yet Sugríva stood dismayed.Near and more near the chieftains came,Then, for intolerable shame,Not daring yet to lift his eyes,Sugríva spoke with burning sighs:\"Thy matchless strength I first beheld,And dared my foe, by thee impelled.Why hast thou tried me with deceitAnd urged me to a sure defeat?Thou shouldst have said, \"I will not slayThy foeman in the coming fray.\"For had I then thy purpose knownI had not waged the fight alone.\"The Vánar sovereign, lofty-souled,In plaintive voice his sorrows told.Then Ráma spake: \"Sugríva, list,All anger from thy heart dismissed,And I will tell the cause that stayedMine arrow, and withheld the aid.In dress, adornment, port, and height,In splendour, battle-shout, and might,No shade of difference could I seeBetween thy foe, O King, and thee.So like was each, I stood at gaze,My senses lost in wildering maze,Nor loosened from my straining bowA deadly arrow at the foe,Lest in my doubt the shaft should sendTo sudden death our surest friend.O, if this hand in heedless guiltAnd rash resolve thy blood had spilt,Through every land, O Vánar King,My wild and foolish act would ring.Sore weight of sin on him must lieBy whom a friend is made to die;And Lakshman, I, and Sítá, bestOf dames, on thy protection rest.On, warrior! for the fight prepare;Nor fear again thy foe to dare.Within one hour thine eye shall viewMy arrow strike thy foeman through;Shall see the stricken Báli lieLow on the earth, and gasp and die.But come, a badge about thee bind,O monarch of the Vánar kind,That in the battle shock mine eyesThe friend and foe may recognize.Come, Lakshman, let that creeper deckWith brightest bloom Sugríva neck,And be a happy token, twinedAround the chief of lofty mind.\"Upon the mountain slope there grewA threading creeper fair to view,And Lakshman plucked the bloom and roundSugríva neck a garland wound.Graced with the flowery wreath he wore,The Vánar chief the semblance boreOf a dark cloud at close of dayEngarlanded with cranes at play,In glorious light the Vánar glowedAs by his comrade side he strode,And, still on Ráma word intent,His steps to great Kishkindhá bent.Canto XIII. The Return To Kishkindhá.Thus with Sugríva, from the sideOf Rishyamúka, Ráma hied,And stood before Kishkindhá gateWhere Báli kept his regal state.The hero in his warrior holdRaised his great bow adorned with gold,And drew his pointed arrow brightAs sunbeams, finisher of fight.Strong-necked Sugríva led the wayWith Lakshman mighty in the fray.Nala and Níla came behindWith Hanumán of lofty mind,And valiant Tára, last in place,A leader of the Vánar race.They gazed on many a tree that showedThe glory of its pendent load,And brook and limpid rill that madeSweet murmurs as they seaward strayed.They looked on caverns dark and deep,On bower and glen and mountain steep,And saw the opening lotus studWith roseate cup the crystal flood,While crane and swan and coot and drakeMade pleasant music on the lake,And from the reedy bank was heardThe note of many a happy bird.In open lawns, in tangled ways,They saw the tall deer stand at gaze,Or marked them free and fearless roam,Fed with sweet grass, their woodland home.At times two flashing tusks betweenThe wavings of the wood were seen,And some mad elephant, alone,Like a huge moving hill, was shown.And scarcely less in size appearedGreat monkeys all with dust besmeared.And various birds that roam the skies,And silvan creatures, met their eyes,As through the wood the chieftains sped,And followed where Sugríva led.Then Ráma, as their way they made,Saw near at hand a lovely shade,And, as he gazed upon the trees,Spake to Sugríva words like these;\"Those stately trees in beauty rise,Fair as a cloud in autumn skies.I fain, my friend, would learn from theeWhat pleasant grove is that I see.\"Thus Ráma spake, the mighty souled;And thus his tale Sugríva told:\"That, Ráma, is a wide retreatThat brings repose to weary feet.Bright streams and fruit and roots are there,And shady gardens passing fair.There, neath the roof of hanging boughs,The sacred Seven maintained their vows.Their heads in dust were lowly laid,In streams their nightly beds were made.Each seventh night they broke their fast,But air was still their sole repast,And when seven hundred years were spentTo homes in heaven the hermits went.Their glory keeps the garden yet,With walls of stately trees beset.Scarce would the Gods and demons dare,By Indra led, to enter there.No beast that roams the wood is found,No bird of air, within the bound;Or, thither if they idly stray,They find no more their homeward way.You hear at times mid dulcet tonesThe chime of anklets, rings, and zones.You hear the song and music sound,And heavenly fragrance breathes around,There duly burn the triple fires(577)Where mounts the smoke in curling spires,And, in a dun wreath, hangs aboveThe tall trees, like a brooding dove.Round branch and crest the vapours closeTill every tree enveloped showsA hill of lazulite when cloudsHang round it with their misty shrouds.With Lakshman, lord of Raghu line,In reverent guise thine head incline,And with fixt heart and suppliant handGive honour to the sainted band.They who with faithful hearts revereThe holy Seven who harboured here,Shall never, son of Raghu, knowIn all their lives an hour of woe.\"Then Ráma and his brother bent,And did obeisance reverentWith suppliant hand and lowly head,Then with Sugríva onward sped.Beyond the sainted Seven abodeFar on their way the chieftains strode,And great Kishkindhá portal gained,The royal town where Báli reigned.Then by the gate they took their standAll ready armed a noble band,And burning every oneTo slay in battle, hand to hand,Their foeman, Indra son.Canto XIV. The Challenge.They stood where trees of densest greenWove round their forms a veiling screen.O\\'er all the garden pleasant shadeThe eyes of King Sugríva strayed,And, as on grass and tree he gazed,The fires of wrath within him blazed.Then like a mighty cloud on high,When roars the tempest through the sky,Girt by his friends he thundered outHis dread sky-rending battle-shoutLike some proud lion in his gait,Or as the sun begins his state,Sugríva let his quick glance restOn Ráma whom he thus addressed:\"There is the seat of Báli sway,Where flags on wall and turret play,Which mighty bands of Vánars hold,Rich in all arms and store of gold.Thy promise to thy mind recallThat Báli by thy hand shall fall.As kindly fruits adorn the bough.So give my hopes their harvest now.\"In suppliant tone the Vánar prayed,And Raghu son his answer made:\"By Lakshman hand this flowery twineWas wound about thee for a sign.The wreath of giant creeper throwsAbout thy form its brillant glows,As though about the sun were setThe bright stars for a coronet.One shaft of mine this day, dear friend,Thy sorrow and thy fear shall end.And, from the bowstring freed, shall beGiver of freedom, King, to thee.Then come, Sugríva, quickly show,Where\\'er he lie, thy bitter foe;And let my glance the wretch descryWhose deeds, a brother name belie.Yea, soon in dust and blood o\\'erthrownShall Báli fall and gasp and groan.Once let this eye the foeman see,Then, if he live to turn and flee,Despise my puny strength, and shameWith foul opprobrium Ráma name.Hast thou not seen his hand, O King,Through seven tall trees one arrow wing?Still in that strength securely trust,And deem thy foeman in the dust.In all my days, though surely triedBy grief and woe, I ne\\'er have lied;And still by duty law restrainedWill ne\\'er with falsehood charge be stained.Cast doubt away: the oath I swareIts kindly fruit shall quickly bear,As smiles the land with golden grainBy mercy of the Lord of rain.Oh, warrior to the gate I defyThy foe with shout and battle-cry,Till Báli with his chain of goldCome speeding from his royal hold.Proud hearts, with warlike fire aglow,Brook not the challenge of a foe:Each on his power and might relies,And most before his ladies eyes.King Báli loves the fray too wellTo linger in his citadel,And, when he hears thy battle-shout,All wild for war will hasten out.\"He spoke. Sugríva raised a cryThat shook and rent the echoing sky,A shout so fierce and loud and dreadThat stately bulls in terror fled,Like dames who fly from threatened stainIn some ignoble monarch reign.The deer in wild confusion ranLike horses turned in battle van.Down fell the birds, like Gods who fallWhen merits fail,(578) at that dread call.So fiercely, boldened for the fray,The offspring of the Lord of DaySent forth his furious shout as loudAs thunder from a labouring cloud,Or, where the gale blows fresh and free,The roaring of the troubled sea.Canto XV. Tárá.That shout, which shook the land with fear,In thunder smote on Báli ear,Where in the chamber barred and closedThe sovereign with his dame reposed.Each amorous thought was rudely stilled,And pride and rage his bosom filled.His angry eyes flashed darkly red,And all his native brightness fled,As when, by swift eclipse assailed,The glory of the sun has failed.While in his fury uncontrolledHe ground his teeth, his eyeballs rolled,He seemed a lake wherein no gemOf blossom decks the lotus stem.He heard, and with indignant prideForth from the bower the Vánar hied.And the earth trembled at the beatAnd fury of his hastening feet.But Tárá to her consort flew,Her loving arms around him threw,And trembling and bewildered, gaveWise counsel that might heal and save:\"O dear my lord, this rage controlThat like a torrent floods thy soul,And cast these idle thoughts awayLike faded wreath of yesterday,O tarry till the morning light,Then, if thou wilt, go forth and fight.Think not I doubt thy valour, no;Or deem thee weaker than thy foe,Yet for a while would have thee stayNor see thee tempt the fight to-day.Now list, my loving lord, and learnThe reason why I bid thee turn.Thy foeman came in wrath and pride,And thee to deadly fight defied.Thou wentest out: he fought, and fledSore wounded and discomfited.But yet, untaught by late defeat,He comes his conquering foe to meet,And calls thee forth with cry and shout:Hence spring, my lord, this fear and doubt.A heart so bold that will not yield,But yearns to tempt the desperate field,Such loud defiance, fiercely pressed,On no uncertain hope can rest.So lately by thine arm o\\'erthrown,He comes not back, I ween, alone.Some mightier comrade guards his side,And spurs him to this burst of pride.For nature made the Vánar wise:On arms of might his hope relies;And never will Sugríva seekA friend whose power to save is weak.Now listen while my lips unfoldThe wondrous tale my Angad told.Our child the distant forest sought,And, learnt from spies, the tidings brought.Two sons of Dasaratha, sprungFrom old Ikshváku, brave and young,Renowned in arms, in war untamed--Ráma and Lakshman are they named--Have with thy foe Sugríva madeA league of love and friendly aid.Now Ráma, famed for exploit high,Is bound thy brother firm ally,Like fires of doom(579) that ruin allHe makes each foe before him fall.He is the suppliant sure defence,The tree that shelters innocence.The poor and wretched seek his feet:In him the noblest glories meet.With skill and knowledge vast and deepHis sire commands he loved to keep;With princely gifts and graces storedAs metals deck the Mountains\\' Lord.(580)Thou canst not, O my hero, standBefore the might of Ráma hand;For none may match his powers or dareWith him in deeds of war compare.Hear, I entreat, the words I say,Nor lightly turn my rede away.O let fraternal discord cease,And link you in the bonds of peace.Let consecrating rites ordainSugríva partner of thy reign.Let war and thoughts of conflict end,And be thou his and Ráma friend,Each soft approach of love begin,And to thy soul thy brother win;For whether here or there he be,Thy brother still, dear lord, is he.Though far and wide these eyes I strainA friend like him I seek in vain.Let gentle words his heart incline,And gifts and honours make him thine,Till, foes no more, in love allied,You stand as brothers side by side.Thou in high rank wast wont to holdSugríva, formed in massive mould;Then come, thy brother love regain,For other aids are weak and vain.If thou would please my soul, and stillPreserve me from all fear and ill,I pray thee by thy love be wiseAnd do the thing which I advise.Assuage thy fruitless wrath, and shunThe mightier arms of Raghu son;For Indra peer in might is he,A foe too strong, my lord, for thee.\"Canto XVI. The Fall Of Báli.Thus Tárá with the starry eyes(581)Her counsel gave with burning sighs.But Báli, by her prayers unmoved,Spurned her advice, and thus reproved:\"How may this insult, scathe, and scornBy me, dear love, be tamely born?My brother, yea my foe, comes nighAnd dares me forth with shout and cry.Learn, trembler! that the valiant, theyWho yield no step in battle fray,Will die a thousand deaths but ne\\'erAn unavenged dishonour bear.Nor, O my love, be thou dismayedThough Ráma lend Sugríva aid,For one so pure and duteous, oneWho loves the right, all sin will shun,Release me from thy soft embrace,And with thy dames thy steps retrace:Enough already, O mine own,Of love and sweet devotion shown.Drive all thy fear and doubt away;I seek Sugríva in the frayHis boisterous rage and pride to still,And tame the foe I would not kill.My fury, armed with brandished trees,Shall strike Sugríva to his knees:Nor shall the humbled foe withstandThe blows of my avenging hand,When, nerved by rage and pride, I beatThe traitor down beneath my feet.Thou, love, hast lent thine own sweet aid,And all thy tender care displayed;Now by my life, by these who yearnTo serve thee well, I pray thee turn.But for a while, dear dame, I goTo come triumphant o\\'er the foe.\"Thus Báli spake in gentlest tone:Soft arms about his neck were thrown;Then round her lord the lady wentWith sad steps slow and reverent.She stood in solemn guise to blessWith prayers for safety and success,Then with her train her chamber soughtBy grief and racking fear distraught.With serpent pantings fierce and fastKing Báli from the city passed.His glance, as each quick breath he drew,Around to find the foe he threw,And saw where fierce Sugríva showedHis form with golden hues that glowed,And, as a fire resplendent, stayedTo meet his foe in arms arrayed.When Báli, long-armed chieftain, foundSugríva stationed on the ground,Impelled by warlike rage he bracedHis warrior garb about his waist,And with his mighty arm raised highRushed at Sugríva with a cry.But when Sugríva, fierce and bold,Saw Báli with his chain of gold,His arm he heaved, his hand he closed,And face to face his foe opposed.To him whose eyes with fury shone,In charge impetuous rushing on,Skilled in each warlike art and plan,Báli with hasty words began:\"My ponderous hand, to fight addressedWith fingers clenched and arm compressedShall on thy death doomed brow descendAnd, crashing down, thy life shall end.\"He spoke; and wild with rage and pride,The fierce Sugríva thus replied:\"Thus let my arm begin the strifeAnd from thy body crush the life.\"Then Báli, wounded and enraged,With furious blows the battle waged.Sugríva seemed, with blood-streams dyed,A hill with fountains in his side.But with his native force unspentA Sál tree from the earth he rent,And like the bolt of Indra smoteOn Báli head and chest and throat.Bruised by the blows he could not shield,Half vanquished Báli sank and reeled,As sinks a vessel with her freightBorne down by overwhelming weight.Swift as Suparna(582) swiftest flightIn awful strength they rushed to fight:So might the sun and moon on highEncountering battle in the sky.Fierce and more fierce, as fought the foes,The furious rage of combat rose.They warred with feet and arms and knees,With nails and stones and boughs and trees,And blows descending fast as rainDyed each dark form with crimson stain,While like two thunder-clouds they metWith battle-cry and shout and threat.Then Ráma saw Sugríva quail,Marked his worn strength grow weak and fail.Saw how he turned his wistful eyeTo every quarter of the sky.His friend defeat he could not brook,Bent on his shaft an eager look,Then burned to slay the conquering foe,And laid his arrow on the bow.As to an orb the bow he drewForth from the string the arrow flewLike Fate tremendous discus hurledBy Yáma(583) forth to end the world.So loud the din that every birdThe bow-string clans with terror heard,And wildly fled the affrighted deerAs though the day of doom were near.So, deadly as the serpent fang,Forth from the string the arrow sprang.Like the red lightning flash and flameIt flew unerring to its aim,And, hissing murder through the air,Pierced Báli breast, and quivered there.Struck by the shaft that flew so wellThe mighty Vánar reeled and fell,As earthward Indra flag they pullWhen Asvíní fair moon is full.(584)Canto XVII. Báli Speech.Like some proud tree before the blastBrave Báli to the ground was cast,Where prostrate in the dust he rolledClad in the sheen of glistening gold,As when uptorn the standard liesOf the great God who rules the skies.When low upon the earth was laidThe lord whom Vánar tribes obeyed,Dark as a moonless sky no moreHis land her joyous aspect wore.Though low in dust and mire was rolledThe form of Báli lofty-souled,Still life and valour, might and graceClung to their well-loved dwelling-place.That golden chain with rich gems set,The choicest gift of Sákra,(585) yetPreserved his life nor let decaySteal strength and beauty light away.Still from that chain divinely wroughtHis dusky form a glory caught,As a dark cloud, when day is done,Made splendid by the dying sun.As fell the hero, crushed in fight,There beamed afar a triple lightFrom limbs, from chain, from shaft that drankHis life-blood as the warrior sank.The never-failing shaft, impelledBy the great bow which Ráma held,Brought bliss supreme, and lit the wayTo Brahmá worlds which ne\\'er decay.(586)Ráma and Lakshman nearer drewThe mighty fallen foe to view,Mahendra son, the brave and bold,The monarch with his chain of gold,With lustrous face and tawny eyes,Broad chest, and arms of wondrous size,Like Lord Mahendra fierce in fight,Or Vishnu never-conquered might,Now fallen like Yayáti(587) sentFrom heaven, his store of merit spent,Like the bright flame that pales and dies,Like the great sun who fires the skies,Doomed in the general doom to fallWhen time shall end and ruin all.The wounded Báli, when he sawRáma and Lakshman nearer draw,Keen words to Raghu son, impressedWith justice\\' holy stamp, addressed:\"What fame, from one thou hast not slainIn front of battle, canst thou gain,Whose secret hand has laid me lowWhen madly fighting with my foe?From every tongue thy glory rings,A scion of a line of kings,True to thy vows, of noblest race,With every gentle gift and grace:Whose tender heart for woe can feel,And joy in every creature weal:Whose breast with high ambition swells,Knows duty claim and ne\\'er rebels.They praise thy valour, patience, ruth,Thy firmness, self-restraint, and truth:Thy hand prepared for sin control,All virtues of a princely soul.I thought of all these gifts of thine,And glories of an ancient line,I set my Tárá tears at naught,I met Sugríva and we fought.O Ráma, till this fatal mornI held that thou wouldst surely scornTo strike me as I fought my foeAnd thought not of a stranger blow,But now thine evil heart is shown,A yawning well with grass o\\'ergrown.Thou wearest virtue badge,(588) but guileAnd meanest sin thy soul defile.I took thee not for treacherous fire,A sinner clad in saint attire;Nor deemed thou idly wouldst professThe show and garb of righteousness.In fenced town, in open land,Ne\\'er hast thou suffered at this hand,Nor canst of proud contempt complain:Then wherefore is the guiltless slain?My harmless life in woods I lead,On forest fruits and roots I feed.My foeman in the field I sought,And ne\\'er with thee, O Ráma, fought.Upon thy limbs, O King, I seeThe raiment of a devotee;And how can one like thee, who springsFrom a proud line of ancient kings,Beneath fair virtue mask, disgraceHis lineage by a deed so base?From Raghu is thy long descent,For duteous deeds prëeminent:Why, sinner clad in saintly dress,Roamest thou through the wilderness?Truth, valour, justice free from spot,The hand that gives and grudges not,The might that strikes the sinner down,These bring a prince his best renown.Here in the woods, O King, we liveOn roots and fruit which branches give.(589)Thus nature framed our harmless race:Thou art a man supreme in place.Silver and gold and land provokeThe fierce attack, the robber stroke,Canst thou desire this wild retreat,The berries and the fruit we eat?\\'Tis not for mighty kings to treadThe flowery path, by pleasure led.Theirs be the arm that crushes sin,Theirs the soft grace to woo and win:The steadfast will that guides the state,Wise favour to the good and great;And for all time are kings renownedWho blend these arts and ne\\'er confound.But thou art weak and swift to ire,Unstable, slave of each desire.Thou tramplest duty in the dust,And in thy bow is all thy trust.Thou carest naught for noble gain,And treatest virtue with disdain,While every sense its captive drawsTo follow pleasure changing laws.I wronged thee not in word or deed,But by thy deadly dart I bleed.What wilt thou, mid the virtuous, sayTo purge thy lasting stain away?All these, O King, must sink to hell,The regicide, the infidel,He who in blood and slaughter joys,A Bráhman or a cow destroys,Untimely weds in law despiteScorning an elder brother right,(590)Who dares his Teacher bed ascend,The miser, spy, and treacherous friend.These impious wretches, one and all,Must to the hell of sinners fall.My skin the holy may not wear,Useless to thee my bones and hair;Nor may my slaughtered body beThe food of devotees like thee.These five-toed things a man may slayAnd feed upon the fallen prey;The mailed rhinoceros may die,And, with the hare his food supply.Iguanas he may kill and eat,With porcupine and tortoise meat.(591)But all the wise account it sinTo touch my bones and hair and skin.My flesh they may not eat; and IA useless prey, O Ráma, die.In vain my Tárá reasoned well,On dull deaf ears her counsel fell.I scorned her words though sooth and sweet,And hither rushed my fate to meet.Ah for the land thou rulest! sheFinds no protection, lord, from thee,Neglected like some noble dameBy a vile husband dead to shame.Mean-hearted coward, false and vile,Whose cruel soul delights in guile,Could Dasaratha, noblest king,Beget so mean and base a thing?Alas! an elephant, in formOf Ráma, in a maddening stormOf passion casting to the groundThe girth of law(592) that clipped him round,Too wildly passionate to feelThe prick of duty guiding steel,(593)Has charged me unawares, and deadI fall beneath his murderous tread.How, stained with this my base defeat,How wilt thou dare, where good men meet,To speak, when every tongue will blameWith keen reproach this deed of shame?Such hero strength and valour, shownUpon the innocent alone,Thou hast not proved in manly strifeOn him who robbed thee of thy wife.Hadst thou but fought in open fieldAnd met me boldly unconcealed,This day had been thy fate to fall,Slain by this hand, to Yáma hall.In vain I strove, and struck by theeFell by a hand I could not see.Thus bites a snake, for sins of yore,A sleeping man who wakes no more.Sugríva foeman thou hast killed,And thus his heart desire fulfilled;But, Ráma, hadst thou sought me first,And told the hope thy soul has nursed,That very day had I restoredThe Maithil lady to her lord;And, binding Rávan with a chain,Had laid him at thy feet unslain.Yea, were she sunk in deepest hell,Or whelmed beneath the ocean swell,I would have followed on her trackAnd brought the rescued lady back,As Hayagríva(594) once set freeFrom hell the white Asvatarí.(595)That when my spirit wings its flightSugríva reign, is just and right.But most unjust, O King, that I,Slain by thy treacherous hand, should lie.Be still, my heart: this earthly stateIs darkly ruled by sovereign Fate.The realm is lost and won: defyThy questioners with apt reply.\"(596)Canto XVIII. Ráma Reply.He ceased: and Ráma heart was stirredAt every keen reproach he heard.There Báli lay, a dim dark sun,His course of light and glory run:Or like the bed of Ocean driedOf his broad floods from side to side,Or helpless, as the dying fire,Hushed his last words of righteous ire.Then Ráma, with his spirit moved,The Vánar king in turn reproved:\"Why dost thou, Báli, thus revile,And castest not a glance the whileOn claims of duty, love, and gain,And customs o\\'er the world that reign?Why dost thou blame me, rash and blind,Fickle as all thy Vánar kind,Slighting each rule of ancient daysWhich all the good and prudent praise?This land, each hill and woody chase,Belongs to old Ikshváku race:With bird and beast and man, the wholeIs ours to cherish and control.Now Bharat, prompt at duty call,Wise, just, and true, is lord of all.Each claim of law, love, gain he knows,And wrath and favour duly shows.A king from truth who never bends,And grace with vigour wisely blends;With valour worthy of his race,He knows the claims of time and place.Now we and other kings of might,By his ensample taught aright,The lands of every region treadThat justice may increase and spread.While royal Bharat, wise and just,Rules the broad earth, his glorious trust,Who shall attempt, while he is lord,A deed by Justice held abhorred?We now, as Bharat has decreed,Let justice guide our every deed,And toil each sinner to repressWho scorns the way of righteousness.Thou from that path hast turned aside,And virtue holy law defied,Left the fair path which kings should tread,And followed pleasure voice instead.The man who cleaves to duty lawRegards these three with filial awe--The sire, the elder brother, thirdHim from whose lips his lore he heard.Thus too, for duty sake, the wiseRegard with fond paternal eyesThe well-loved younger brother, oneTheir lore has ripened, and a son.Fine are the laws which guide the good,Abstruse, and hardly understood;Only the soul, enthroned withinThe breast of each, knows right from sin.But thou art wild and weak of soul,And spurnest, like thy race, control;The true and right thou canst not find,The blind consulting with the blind.Incline thine ear and I will teachThe cause that prompts my present speech.This tempest of thy soul assuage,Nor blame me in thine idle rage.On this great sin thy thoughts bestow,The sin for which I lay thee low.Thou, Báli, in thy brother lifeHast robbed him of his wedded wife,And keepest, scorning ancient right,His Rumá for thine own delight.Thy son own wife should scarcely beMore sacred in thine eyes than she.All duty thou hast scorned, and henceComes punishment for dire offence.For those who blindly do amissThere is, I ween, no way but this:To check the rash who dare to strayFrom customs which the good obey,I may not, sprung of Kshatriya line,Forgive this heinous sin of thine:The laws for those who sin like theeThe penalty of death decree.Now Bharat rules with sovereign sway,And we his royal word obey.There was no hope of pardon, none,For the vile deed that thou hast done,That wisest monarch dooms to dieThe wretch whose crimes the law defy;And we, chastising those who err,His righteous doom administer.My soul accounts Sugríva dearE\\'en as my brother Lakshman here.He brings me blessing, and I sworeHis wife and kingdom to restore:A bond in solemn honour boundWhen Vánar chieftains stood around.And can a king like me forsakeHis friend, and plighted promise break?Reflect, O Vánar, on the cause,The sanction of eternal laws,And, justly smitten down, confessThou diest for thy wickedness.By honour was I bound to lendAssistance to a faithful friend;And thou hast met a righteous fateThy former sins to expiate.And thus wilt thou some merit winAnd make atonement for thy sin.For hear me, Vánar King, rehearseWhat Manu(597) spake in ancient verse,--This holy law, which all acceptWho honour duty, have I kept:\"Pure grow the sinners kings chastise,And, like the virtuous, gain the skies;By pain or full atonement freed,They reap the fruit of righteous deed,While kings who punish not incurThe penalties of those who err.\"Mándhátá(598) once, a noble king,Light of the line from which I spring,Punished with death a devoteeWhen he had stooped to sin like thee;And many a king in ancient timeHas punished frantic sinners\\' crime,And, when their impious blood was spilt,Has washed away the stain of guilt.Cease, Báli, cease: no more complain:Reproaches and laments are vain,For thou art justly punished: weObey our king and are not free.Once more, O Báli, lend thine earAnother weightiest plea to hear.For this, when heard and pondered well,Will all complaint and rage dispel.My soul will ne\\'er this deed repent,Nor was my shaft in anger sent.We take the silvan tribes besetWith snare and trap and gin and net,And many a heedless deer we smiteFrom thickest shade, concealed from sight.Wild for the slaughter of the game,At stately stags our shafts we aim.We strike them bounding scared away,We strike them as they stand at bay,When careless in the shade they lie,Or scan the plain with watchful eye.They turn away their heads; we aim,And none the eager hunter blame.Each royal saint, well trained in lawOf duty, loves his bow to drawAnd strike the quarry, e\\'en as thouHast fallen by mine arrow now,Fighting with him or unaware,--A Vánar thou.--I little care.(599)But yet, O best of Vánars, knowThat kings who rule the earth bestowFruit of pure life and virtuous deed,And lofty duty hard-won meed.Harm not thy lord the king: abstainFrom act and word that cause him pain;For kings are children of the skiesWho walk this earth in men disguise.But thou, in duty claims untaught,Thy breast with blinding passion fraught,Assailest me who still have clungTo duty, with thy bitter tongue.\"He ceased: and Báli sore distressedThe sovereign claims of law confessed,And freed, o\\'erwhelmed with woe and shame,The lord of Raghu race from blame.Then, reverent palm to palm applied,To Ráma thus the Vánar cried:\"True, best of men, is every wordThat from thy lips these ears have heard,It ill beseems a wretch like meTo bandy empty words with thee.Forgive the angry taunts that brokeFrom my wild bosom as I spoke.And lay not to my charge, O King,My mad reproaches\\' idle sting.Thou, in the truth by trial trained,Best knowledge of the right hast gained:And layest, just and pure within,The meetest penalty on sin.Through every bond of law I burst,The boldest sinner and the worst.O let thy right-instructing speechConsole my heart and wisely teach.\"Like some sad elephant who standsFast sinking in the treacherous sands,Thus Báli raised despairing eyes;Then spake again with sobs and sighs:\"Not for myself, O King, I grieve,For Tárá or the friends I leave,As for sweet Angad, my dear son,My noble, only little one.For, nursed in luxury and bliss,His father he will mourn and miss,And like a stream whose fount is dryWill waste away and sink and die,--My own dear child, my only boy,His mother Tárá hope and joy.Spare him, O son of Raghu, spareThe child entrusted to thy care.My Angad and Sugríva treatE\\'en as thy heart considers meet,For thou, O chief of men, art strongTo guard the right and punish wrong.O, if thou wilt thine ear inclineTo hear these dying words of mine,He and Sugríva will to theeAs Bharat and as Lakshman be.Let not my Tárá, left forlorn,Weep for Sugríva wrathful scorn;Nor let him, for her lord offence,Condemn her faithful innocence.And well and wisely may he reignIf thy dear grace his power sustain:If, following thee his friend and guide,He turn not from thy hest aside:Thus may he reign with glory, nayThus to the skies will win his way.Though stayed by Tárá fond recall,By thy dear hand I longed to fall.Against my brother rushed and fought,And gained the death I long have sought.\"Then Ráma thus the prince consoledFrom whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:\"Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,Nor tremble for thyself or us,For we will deal with thine and theeAs duty and the laws decree.He who exacts and he who pays,Is justly slain or justly slays,Shall in the life to come have bliss;For each has done his task in this.Thou, wandering from the right, art madePure by the forfeit thou hast paid.Thy weight of sins is cast aside,And duty claim is satisfied.Then grieve no more, O Prince, but clearThy bosom from all doubt and fear,For fate, inexorably stern,Thou hast no power to move or turn.Thy princely Angad still will shareMy tender love, Sugríva care;And to thy offspring shall be shownAffection that shall match thine own.\"Canto XIX. Tárá Grief.No answer gave the Vánar kingTo Ráma prudent counselling.Battered and bruised by tree and stone,By Ráma arrow overthrown,Fainting upon the ground he lay,Gasping his troubled life away.But Tárá in the Vánar hallHeard tidings of her husband fall;Heard that a shaft from Ráma bowHad laid the royal Báli low.Her darling Angad by her side,Distracted from her home she hied.Then nigh the place of battle drewThe Vánars, Angad retinue.They saw the bow-armed Ráma: dreadFell on them, and they turned and fled.Like helpless deer, their leaders slain,So wildly fled the startled train.But Tárá saw, and nearer pressed,And thus the flying band addressed:\"O Vánars, ye who ever standAbout our king, a trusty band,Where is the lion master? whyForsake ye thus your lord and fly?Say, lies he dead upon the plain,A brother by a brother slain,Or pierced by shafts from Ráma bowThat rain from far upon the foe?\"Thus Tárá questioned, and was still:Then, wearers of each shape at will,The Vánars thus with one accordAnswered the Lady of their lord:\"Turn, Tárá turn, and half undoneSave Angad thy beloved son.There Ráma stands in death disguise,And conquered Báli faints and dies.He by whose strong arm, thick and fast,Uprooted trees and rocks were cast,Lies smitten by a shaft that cameResistless as the lightning flame.When he, whose splendour once could vieWith Indra, regent of the sky,Fell by that deadly arrow, allThe Vánars fled who marked his fall.Let all our chiefs their succours bring,And Angad be anointed king;For all who come of Vánar raceWill serve him set in Báli place.Or else our conquering foes to-dayWithin our wall will force their way,Polluting with their hostile feetThe chambers of thy loved retreat.Great fear is on us, all and one.Those who have wives and who have none,They lust for power, are fierce and bold,Or hate us for the strife of old.\"She heard their speech as, sore afraid,Arrested in their flight, they stayed,And gave her answer as becameThe spirit of so true a dame:\"Nay, what have I to do with pelf,With son, with kingdom, or with self,When he, my noble lord, who leadsThe Vánars like a lion, bleeds?His high-souled victor will I meet,And throw me prostrate at his feet.\"She hastened forth, her bosom rentWith anguish, weeping as she went,And striking, mastered by her woes,Her head and breast with frantic blows.She hurried to the field and foundHer husband prostrate on the ground,Who quelled the hostile Vánars\\' might,Whose bank was never turned in flight:Whose arm a massy rock could throwAs Indra hurls his bolts below:Fierce as the rushing tempest, loudAs thunder from a labouring cloud:Whene\\'er he roared his voice of fearStruck terror on the boldest ear:Now slain, as, hungry for the prey,A tiger might a lion slay:Or when, his serpent foe to seek,Suparna(600) with his furious beakTears up a sacred hillock, longThe reverence of a village throng,Its altar with their offerings spread,And the gay flag that waved o\\'erhead.She looked and saw the victor standResting upon his bow his hand:And fierce Sugríva she descried,And Lakshman by his brother side.She passed them by, nor stayed to view,Swift to her husband side she flew;Then as she looked, her strength gave way,And in the dust she fell and lay.Then, as if startled ere the closeOf slumber, from the earth she rose.Upon her dying husband, roundWhose soul the coils of Death were wound,Her eyes in agony she bentAnd called him with a shrill lament.Sugríva, when he heard her cries,And saw the queen with weeping eyes,And youthful Angad standing there,His load of grief could hardly bear.Canto XX. Tárá Lament.Again she bent her to the ground,Her arms about her husband wound.Sobbed on his breast, and sick and faintWith anguish poured her wild complaint:\"Brave in the charge of battle, boastAnd glory of the Vánar host,Why on the cold earth wilt thou lieAnd give no answer when I cry?Up, warrior, from thy lowly bed!A meeter couch for thee is spread.It ill beseems a glorious kingOn the bare ground his limbs to fling.Ah, surely must thy love be strongFor her whom thou hast governed long,If thou, my hero, canst reclineOn her cold breast forsaking mine.Or, famed for justice through the land,Thou on the road to heaven hast plannedSome city fairer far than thisTo be thy new metropolis.Are all our pleasures ended now,With those delicious hours which thouAnd I, dear lord, together spentIn woods that breathed the honey scent?Whelmed in my sorrow boundless sea,There is no joy, no hope, for me,When my beloved lord, who ledThe Vánars to the fight, is dead,My widowed heart is stern and cold.Or, at the sight mine eyes behold,O\\'ermastered would it end this acheAnd in a thousand fragments break.Ah noble Vánar, doomed to payThe penalty of all today--Sugríva from his home expelled,And Rumá(601) from his arms withheld.Our Vánar race and thee to save,Wise counsel for thy weal I gave;But thou, by wildest folly stirred,Wouldst give no credence to my word,And now wilt woo the nymphs above,And shake their souls with pangs of love.Ah, never could it be that thouBeneath Sugríva power shouldst bow,Thy conqueror is none but FateWhose mandates all who breathe await.And does no thrill of anguish runThrough the stern breast of Raghu son,Whose base hand dealt a coward blow,And smote thee fighting with thy foe?Reft of my lord my days, alas!In bitter bitter woe will pass:And I, long blest with every good,Must bear my dreary widowhood.And when his uncle brow is stern,When his fierce eyes with fury burn,Ah, what will be my Angad fate,So fair and young and delicate?Come, darling, for the last sad sight,Of thy dear sire who loved the right;For soon thine eyes will long in vainA look at that loved face to gain.And, hero, as thy child draws near,With tender words his spirit cheer;Thy dying wishes gently speak,And kiss him on the brows and cheek.High fame, I ween, has Ráma wonBy this great deed his hand has done,His debt to brave Sugríva paidAnd kept the promise that he made.Be happy, King Sugríva, lordOf Ramá to thine arms restored:Enjoy uninterrupted reign,For he, thy foe, at length is slain.Dost thou not hear me speak, and whyHast thou no word of soft reply?Will thou not lift thine eyes and seeThese dames who look to none but thee?\"From their sad eyes, as Tárá spoke,The floods of bitter sorrow broke:Then, pressing close to Angad side,Each lifted up her voice and cried:\"How couldst thou leave thine Angad thus,And go, for ever go, from us--Thy child so dear in brave attire,Graced with the virtues of his sire?If e\\'er in want of thought, O chief,One deed of mine have caused thee grief,Forgive my folly, I entreat,And with my head I touch thy feet.\"Again the hapless Tárá weptAs to her husband side she crept,And wild with sorrow and dismaySat on the ground where Báli lay.Canto XXI. Hanumán Speech.There, like a fallen star, the dameFell by her lord half lifeless frame;And Hanumán drew softly near,And strove her grieving heart to cheer:\"By changeless law our bliss and woeFrom ancient worth and folly flow.What fruits soe\\'er we cull, the seedsWere scattered by our former deeds.(602)Why mourn another mournful fate,And weep, thyself unfortunate?Be calm, O thou whose heart is wise,For none deserves another sighs.Look up, with idle sorrow strive:Thy child, his heir, is yet alive.Let needful rites be duly done,Nor in thy woe forget thy son.Regard the law which all obey:They spring to life, they pass away.Begin the task that bids thee rise,And stay these tears, for thou art wise.Our lord the king is doomed to die,On whom ten million hearts rely.Kind, liberal, patient, true, and justWas he in whom they place their trust,And now he seeks the land of thoseWho for the right subdue their foes.Each Vánar lord with all his train,Each ranger of this wild domain,And Angad here, thy darling, seeA governor and friend in thee.These twain(603) whose hearts with sorrow acheThe funeral rites shall undertake,And Angad by his mother careBe king, his father rightful heir.Now let him pay, as laws require,His sacred duty to his sire,Nor one solemnity omitOf all that mighty kings befit.And when thy fond eye sees thine ownDear Angad on his father throne,Then, lightened of its load of pain,Thy spirit will have rest again.\"She heard his speech, she heaved her head,Looked upon Hanumán and said:\"Sweeter my slain lord limbs to touch,Than Angad or a hundred such.No rule or right, a widowed dame,O\\'er Angad or the realm I claim.Sugríva is the uncle, heIn every act supreme must be.I pray thee, chief, this plan resign,Nor claim from me what ne\\'er is mine.The father with his tender careGuards the dear child the mother bare,Where\\'er I be, no sweeter task,No happier joy I hope or askThan thus to sit with loving eyesAnd watch the bed where Báli lies.Canto XXII. Báli Dead.There breathing still with slow faint sighsLay Báli on the ground: his eyes,Damp with the tears of death, he raised,On conquering Sugríva gazed,And then in clearest speech expressedThe tender feelings of his breast:\"Not to my charge, Sugríva, layThine injuries avenged to-day;But rather blame resistless FateThat urged me on infuriate.Fate ne\\'er agreed our lives to blessWith simultaneous happiness:To dwell like brothers side by sideIn tender love was still denied.The Vánars\\' realm is thine to-day:Begin, O King, thy rightful sway;(604)For I must go at Yáma callTo sojourn in his gloomy hall;Must part and leave this very hourMy life, my realm, my kingly power,And go instead of these to gainBright glory free from spot and stain.Now at thy hands one boon I seekWith the last words my lips shall speak,And, though it be no easy thing,Perform the task I give thee, King.This son of mine, no foolish boy,Worthy of bliss and nursed in joy,--See, prostrate on the ground he lies,The hot tears welling from his eyes--The child I love so well, more sweetThan life itself, for woe unmeet,--To him be kindly favour shown:O guard and keep him as thine own.Retain him ever by thy side,His father, helper, friend, and guide.From fear and woe his young life save,And give him all his father gave.Then Tárá son in time shall beBrave, resolute, and famed like thee,And march before thee to the fightWhere stricken fiends shall own his might.While yet a tender stripling, fameShall bruit abroad his warrior name,And brightly shall his glory shineFor exploits worthy of his line.Child of Sushen,(605) my Tárá wellObscurest lore can read and tell;And, trained in wondrous art, divinesEach mystery of boding signs.Her solemn warning ne\\'er despise,Do boldly what her lips advise;For things to come her eye can see,And with her words events agree.And for the son of Raghu sakeThe toil and danger undertake:For breach of faith were grievous wrong,Nor wouldst thou be unpunished long.Now, brother, take this chain of gold,Gift of celestial hands of old,Or when I die its charm will flee,And all its might be lost with me.\"The loving speech Sugríva heard,And all his heart with woe was stirred.Remorse and gentle pity stoleEach thought of triumph from his soul:Thus fades the light when Ráhu(606) marsThe glory of the Lord of Stars.(607)All angry thoughts were stayed and stilledAnd kindly love his bosom filled.His brother word the chief obeyedAnd took the chain as Báli prayed.On little Angad standing nighThe dying hero fixed his eye,And, ready from this world to part,Spoke the fond utterance of his heart:\"Let time and place thy thoughts employ:In woe be strong, be meek in joy.Accept both pain and pleasure, stillObedient to Sugríva will.Thou hast, my darling, from the firstWith tender care been softly nursed;But harder days, if thou wouldst winSugríva love, must now begin.To those who hate him ne\\'er incline,Nor count his foe a friend of thine.In all thy thoughts his welfare seek,Obedient, lowly, faithful, meek.Let no rash suit his bosom pain,Nor yet from due requests abstain.(608)Each is a grievous fault, betweenThe two is found the happy mean.\"Then Báli ceased: his eyeballs rolledIn stress of anguish uncontrolledHis massive teeth were bared to view,And from the frame the spirit flew.Their lord and leader dead, the crowdOf noblest Vánars shrieked aloud:\"Since thou, O King, hast sought the skiesAll desolate Kishkindhá lies.Her woods, where Vánars loved to rove,Are empty now, and hill and grove.From every eye the light is fled,Since thou, our mighty lord, art dead.Thine was the unwearied arm that boreThe brunt of deadly fight of yoreWith Golabh the Gandharva, when,Lasting through five long years and ten,The dreadful conflict knew no stayIn gloom of night, in glare of day;And when the fifteenth year had pastThy dire opponent fell at last.If such a foeman fell beneathOur hero arm and awful teethWho freed us from our terror, howIs conquering Báli fallen now?\"Then when they saw their leader slainGreat anguish seized the Vánar train,Weeping their mighty chief, as whenIn pastures near a lion denThe cows by sudden fear are stirred,Slain the bold bull who led the herd.And hapless Tárá sank belowThe whelming waters of her woe,Looked upon Báli face and fellBeside him whom she loved go well,Like a young creeper clinging roundA tall tree prostrate on the ground.Canto XXIII. Tárá Lament.She kissed her lifeless husband face,She clasped him in a close embrace,Laid her soft lips upon his head;Then words like these the mourner said:\"No words of mine wouldst thou regard,And now thy bed is cold and hard.Upon the rude rough ground o\\'erthrown,Beneath thee naught but sand and stone.To thee the earth is dearer farThan I and my caresses are,If thou upon her breast wilt lie,And to my words make no reply.Ah my beloved, good and brave,Bold to attack and strong to save,Fate is Sugríva thrall, and weIn him our lord and master see.Lo, by thy bed, a mournful band,Thy Vánar chiefs lamenting stand.O hear thy nobles\\' groans and cries,O mark thy Angad weeping eyes,O list to my entreaties, breakThe chains of slumber and awake.Ah me, my lord, this lowly bedWhere rest thy limbs and fallen head,Is the cold couch where smitten layThy foemen in the bloody fray.O noble heart from blemish free,Lover of war, beloved by me.Why hast thou fled away and leftThy Tárá of all hope bereft?Unwise the father who allowsHis child to be a warrior spouse,For, hero, see thy consort fate,A widow now most desolate,For ever broken is my pride,My hope of lasting bliss has died,And sinking in the lowest deepOf sorrow sea I pine and weep.Ah, surely not of earthly mould,This stony heart is stern and cold,Or, in a hundred pieces rent,It had not lingered to lament.Dead, dead! my husband, friend, and lordIn whom my loving hopes were stored,First in the field, his foemen dread,My own victorious Báli, dead!A woman when her lord has died,Though children flourish by her side,Though stores of gold her coffers fill,Is called a lonely widow still.Alas, thy bleeding gashes makeAround thy limbs a purple lake:Thus slumbering was thy wont to lieOn cushions bright with crimson dye.Dark streams of welling blood besmearThy limbs where dust and mire adhere,Nor have I strength, weighed down by woe,Mine arms about thy form to throw.The issue of this day has broughtSugríva all his wishes sought,For Ráma shot one shaft and heIs freed from fear and jeopardy.Alas, alas, I may not restMy head upon thy wounded breast,Obstructed by the massive dartDeep buried in thy bleeding heart.\"Then Níla from his bosom drewThe fatal shaft that pierced him through,Like some tremendous serpent deepIn caverns of a hill asleep.As from the hero wound it came,Shot from the shaft a gleam of flame,Like the last flashes of the sunDescending when his course is run.From the wide rent in crimson floodRushed the full stream of Báli blood,Like torrents down a mountain sideWith golden ore and copper dyed.Then Tárá brushed with tender careThe dust of battle from his hair,While her sad eyes poured down their rainUpon her lord untimely slain.Once more she looked upon the dead;Then to her bright-eyed child she said:\"Turn hither, turn thy weeping eyesWhere low in death thy father lies.By sinful deed and bitter hateOur lord has met his mournful fate.Bright as the sun at early mornTo Yáma halls is Báli borne.Then go, my child, salute the king,From whom our bliss and honour spring.\"Obedient to his mother hestHis father feet he gently pressedWith twining arms and lingering hands:\"Father,\" he cried, \"here Angad stands.\"Then Tárá: \"Art thou stern and mute,Regardless of thy child salute?Hast thou no blessing for thy son,No word for little Angad, none?O, hero, at thy lifeless feetHere with my boy I take my seat,As some sad mother of the herd,By the fierce lion undeterred,Lies moaning by the grassy dellWherein her lord and leader fell.How, having wrought that awful rite,The sacrifice of deadly fight,Wherein the shaft by Ráma spedSupplied the place of water shed,How hast thou bathed thee at the endWithout thy wife her aid to lend?(609)Why do mine eyes no more beholdThy bright beloved chain of gold,Which, pleased with thee, the Immortals\\' KingAbout thy neck vouchsafed to fling?Still lingering on thy lifeless faceI see the pride of royal race:Thus when the sun has set, his glowStill rests upon the Lord of Snow.Alas my hero! undeterredThou wouldst not listen to my word.With tears and prayers I sued in vain:Thou wouldst not listen, and art slain.Gone is my bliss, my glory: IAnd Angad now with thee will die.\"Canto XXIV. Sugríva Lament.But when Sugríva saw her weepO\\'erwhelmed in sorrow rushing deep,Swift through his bosom pierced the stingOf anguish for the fallen king.At the sad sight his eyes beheldA flood of bitter tears outwelled,And, with his bosom racked and rent,To Ráma with his train he went.He came with faltering steps and slowWhere Ráma held his mighty bowAnd arrow like a venomed snake,And to the son of Raghu spake:\"Well hast thou kept, O King, thy vow:The promised fruit is gathered now.But life is marred, my soul to-dayTurns sickening from all joy away.For, while this queen laments and sighsAmid a mourning people cries,And Angad weeps his father slain,How can my heart delight to reign?For outrage, fury, senseless pride,My brother, doomed of yore, has died.Yet, Raghu son, in bitter woeI mourn his fated overthrow.Ah, better far in pain and illTo dwell on Rishyamúka stillThan gain the heaven of Gods and allIts pleasures by my brother fall.Did not he cry,--great-hearted foe,--\"Go, for I will not slay thee, Go\"?With his brave soul those words agree:My speech, my deeds, are worthy me.How can a brother counterweighHis grievous loss with joys of sway,And see with dull unpitying eyeSo brave and good a brother die?His lofty soul was nobly blind:My death alas, he ne\\'er designed;But I, urged blindly on by hate,Sought with his life my rage to sate.He smote me with a splintered tree:I groaned aloud and turned to flee,From stern reproaches he forbore,And gently bade me sin no more.Serene and dutiful and goodHe kept the laws of brotherhood:I, fierce and greedy, vengeful, base,Showed all the vices of our race.Ah me, dear friend, my brother fateLays on my soul a crushing weight:A sin no heart should e\\'er conceive,But at the thought each soul should grieve:Sin such as Indra when his blowLaid heavenly Visvarúpa(610) low.Yet earth, the waters of the seas,The race of women and the treesWere fain upon themselves to takeThe weight of sin for Indra sake.But who a Vánar soul will free,Or ease the load that crushes me?Wretch that I am, I may not claimThe reverence due to royal name.How shall I reign supreme, or dareAffect the power I should not share?Ah me, I sorrow for my sin,The ruin of my race and kin,Polluted by a hideous crimeWorld-hated till the end of time.Alas, the floods of sorrow rollWith whelming force upon my soul:So gathers the descending rainIn the deep hollow of the plain.\"Canto XXV. Ráma Speech.Then Raghu son, whose feeling breastShared the great woe that moved the rest,Strove with wise charm their grief to easeAnd gently spoke in words like these:\"You ne\\'er can raise the dead to blissBy agony of grief like this.Cease your lament, nor leave undoneThe funeral task you may not shun.As nature orders o\\'er the dead.Your tributary tears are shed,But Fate, directing each event,Is still the lord preëminent.Yes, all obey the changeless lawsOf Fate the universal cause.By Fate, the lives of all proceed,That governs every word and deed,None acts, none sees his hest obeyed,But each and all by Fate are swayed.The world its ordered course maintains,And o\\'er that course Fate ever reigns.Fate ne\\'er exceeds the rule of Fate:Is ne\\'er too swift, is ne\\'er too late,And making nature its allyForgets no life, nor passes by.No kith and kin, no power and forceCan check or stay its settled course,No friend or client, grace or charm,That victor of the world disarm.So all who see with prudent eyesThe hand of Fate must recognize,For virtue rules, or love, or gain,As Fate unchanged decrees ordain.Báli has died and won the meedThat waits in heaven on noble deed,Throned in the seats the brave may reachBy liberal hand and gentle speech,True to a warrior duty, boldIn fight, the hero lofty-souledDeigned not to guard his life: he died,And now in heaven is glorified.Then cease these tears and wild despair:Turn to the task that claims your care,For Báli is the glorious fateWhich warriors count most fortunate.\"When Ráma speech had found a close,Brave Lakshman, terror of his foes,With wise and soothing words addressedSugríva still with woe oppressed:\"Arise Sugríva,\" thus he said,\"Perform the service of the dead.Prepare with Tárá and her sonThat Báli rites be duly done.A store of funeral wood provideWhich wind and sun and time have driedAnd richest sandal fit to graceThe pyre of one of royal race.With words of comfort soft and kindConsole poor Angad troubled mind,Nor let thy heart be thus cast down,For thine is now the Vánars\\' town.Let Angad care a wreath supply,And raiment rich with varied dye,And oil and perfumes for the fire,And all the solemn rites require.Go, hasten to the town, O King,And Tárá little quickly bring.A virtue is despatch: and speedIs best of all in hour of need.Go, let a chosen band prepareThe litter of the dead to bear.For stout and tall and strong of limbMust be the chiefs who carry him.\"He spoke,--his friends\\' delight and pride,--Then stood again by Ráma side.When Tára(611) heard the words he saidWithin the town he quickly sped,And brought, on stalwart shoulders laid,The litter for the rites arrayed,Framed like a car for Gods, completeWith painted sides and royal seat,With latticed windows deftly made,And golden birds and trees inlaid:Well joined and wrought in every part,A marvel of ingenious art.Where pleasure mounds in carven woodAnd many a graven figure stood.The best of jewels o\\'er it hung,And wreaths of flowers around it clung,And over all was raised on highA canopy of saffron dye,While like the sun of morning shoneThe brilliant blooms that lay thereon.That glorious litter Ráma eyed.And spake to Lakshman by his side:\"Let Báli on the bier be placedAnd with all funeral service graced.\"Sugríva then with many a tearDrew Báli body to the bierWhereon, with weeping Angad aid,The relics of the chief were laidNeath many a vesture varied fold,And wreaths and ornaments and gold.Then King Sugríva bade them speedThe obsequies by law decreed:\"Let Vánars lead the way and throwRich gems around them as they go,And be the chosen bearers nearBehind them laden with the bier.No costly rite may you deny,Used when the proudest monarchs die:As for a king of widest sway.Perform his obsequies to-day.\"Sugríva gave his high behest;Then Princely Tára and the rest,With little Angad weeping, ledThe long procession of the dead.Behind the funeral litter came,With Tárá first, each widowed dame,In tears and shrieks her loss deplored,Add cried aloud, My lord! My lord!While wood and hill and valley sentIn echoes back the shrill lament.Then on a low and sandy isleWas reared the hero funeral pileBy crowds of toiling Vánars, whereThe mountain stream ran fresh and fair,The Vánar chiefs, a noble band,Had laid the litter on the sand,And stood a little space apart,Each mourning in his inmost heart.But Tárá, when her weeping eyeSaw Báli, on the litter lie,Laid his dear head upon her lap,And wailed aloud her dire mishap;\"O mighty Vánar, lord and king,To whose fond breast I loved to cling,Of goodly arms, wise, brave, and bold,Rise, look upon me as of old.Rise up, my sovereign, dost thou seeA crowd of subjects weep for thee?Still o\\'er thy face, though breath has fled,The joyous light of life is spread:Thus around the sun, although he set,A crimson glory lingers yet.Death clad in Ráma form to-dayHast dragged thee from the world away.One shaft from his tremendous bowDooms us to widowhood and woe.Hast thou, O Vánar King, no eyesThy weeping wives to recognize,Who for the length of way unmeetHave followed thee with weary feet?Yet every moon-faced beauty hereBy thee, O King was counted dear.Lord of the Vánar race, hast thouNo eyes to see Sugríva now?About thee stands in mournful moodA sore-afflicted multitude,And Tára and thy lords of stateAround their monarch weep and wait.Arise my lord, with gentle speech,As was thy wont, dismissing each,Then in the forest will we playAnd love shall make our spirits gay.\"The Vánar dames raised Tárá, drownedIn floods of sorrow, from the ground;And Angad with Sugríva aid,O\\'erwhelmed with anguish and dismayed,Weeping for his departed sire,Placed Báli body on the pyre:Then lit the flame, and round the deadPassed slowly with a mourner tread.Thus with full rites the funeral trainPerformed the service for the slain,Then sought the flowing stream and madeLibations to the parted shade.There, setting Angad first in place,The chieftains of the Vánar race,With Tárá and Sugríva, shedThe water that delights the dead.Canto XXVI. The Coronation.Each Vánar councillor and peerIn crowded numbers gathered nearSugríva, mournful king, while yetHis vesture from the wave was wet,Before the chief of Raghu seedUnwearied in each arduous deed,They stood and raised the reverent handAs saints before Lord Brahmá stand.Then Hanumán of massive mould,Like some tall hill of glistering gold,Son of the God whose wild blasts shakeThe forest, thus to Ráma spake:\"By thy kind favour, O my lord,Sugríva, to his home restoredTriumphant, has regained to-dayHis rank and power and royal sway.He now will call each faithful friend,Enter the city, and attendWith sage advice and prudent careTo every task that waits him there.Then balm and unguent shall anointOur monarch, as the laws appoint,And gems and precious wreaths shall beHis grateful offering, King, to thee.Do thou, O Ráma, with thy friendThy steps within the city bend;Our ruler on his throne install,And with thy presence cheer us all.\"Then, skilled in lore and arts that guideThe speaker, Raghu son replied:\"For fourteen years I might not breakThe mandate that my father spake;Nor can I, till that time be fled,The street of town or village tread.Let King Sugríva seek the townMost worthy of her high renown,There let him be without delayAnointed, and begin his sway.\"This answered, to Sugríva thenThus spake anew the king of men:\"Do thou who knowest right ordainPrince Angad consort of thy reign;For he is noble, true, and bold,And trained a righteous course to holdGifts like his sire that youth adornBorn eldest to the eldest born.This is the month of Srávan,(612) firstOf those that see the rain-clouds burst.Four months, thou knowest well, extendsThe season when the rain descends.No time for deeds of war is this:Seek thou thy fair metropolis,And I with Lakshman, O my friend,The time upon this hill will spend.An ample cavern opens thereMade lovely by the mountain air,And lotuses and lilies fillThe pleasant lake and murmuring rill.When Kártik(613) month shall clear the skies,Then tempt the mighty enterprise.Now, chieftain to thy home repair,And be anointed sovereign there.\"Sugríva heard: he bowed his head:Within the lovely town he spedWhich Báli royal will had swayed,Where thousand Vánar chiefs arrayedGathered in order round their king,And led him on with welcoming.Low on the earth the lesser crowdFell in prostration as they bowed.Sugríva looked with grateful eyes,Spake to them all and bade them rise.Then through the royal bowers he strodeWherein the monarch wives abode.Soon from the inner chambers cameThe Vánar of exalted fame;And joyful friends drew near and shedKing-making balm upon his head,Like Gods anointing in the skiesTheir sovereign of the thousand eyes.(614)Then brought they, o\\'er their king to holdThe white umbrella decked with gold,And chouries with their waving hairIn golden handles wondrous fair;And fragrant herbs and seed and spice,And sparkling gems exceeding price,And every bloom from woods and leas,And gum distilled from milky trees;And precious ointment white as milk,And spotless robes of cloth and silk,Wreaths of sweet flowers whose glories gleamIn grassy grove, on lake or stream.And fragrant sandal and each scentThat makes the soft breeze redolent;Grain, honey, odorous seed, and storeOf oil and curd and golden ore;A noble tiger skin, a pairOf sandals wrought with costliest care,Eight pairs of damsels drawing nighBrought unguents stained with varied dye.Then gems and cates and robes displayedBefore the twice-born priests were laid,That they would deign in order dueTo consecrate the king anew.The sacred grass was duly spreadAnd sacrificial flame was fed,Which Scripture-learned priests suppliedWith oil which texts had sanctified.Then, with all rites ordained of old,High on the terrace bright with gold,Whereon a glorious carpet lay,And fresh-culled garlands sweet and gay,Placed on his throne, Sugríva bentHis looks toward the Orient.In horns from forehead of the bull,In pitchers bright and beautiful,In urns of gold the Vánara tookPure water brought from stream and brook,From every consecrated strandAnd every sea that beats the land.Then, as prescribed by sacred loreAnd many a mighty sage of yore,(615)The leaders of the Vánars pouredThe sacred water on their lord.(616)From every Vánar at the closeOf that imperial rite aroseShouts of glad triumph, loud and longRepeated by the high-souled throng.Sugríva, when the rite was done,Obeyed the hest of Raghu son,Prince Angad to his breast he strained,And partner of his sway ordained.Once more from all the host rang outThe loud huzza and jovful shout.\"Well done! well done!\" each Vánar cried,And good Sugríva glorified.Then with glad voices loudly raisedWere Ráma and his brother praised;And bright Kishkindhá shone that dayWith happy throngs and banners gay.Canto XXVII. Ráma On The Hill.But when the solemn rite was o\\'er,And bold Sugríva reigned once more,The sons of Raghu sought the hill,Prasravan of the rushing rill,Where roamed the tiger and the deer,And lions raised their voice of fear;Thick set with trees of every kind,With trailing shrubs and plants entwined;Home of the ape and monkey, lairOf mountain cat and pard and bear.In cloudy gloom against the skyThe sanctifying hills rose high.Pierced in their crest, a spacious caveTo Raghu sons a shelter gave.Then Ráma, pure from every crime,In words well suited to the timeTo Lakshman spake, whose faithful zealWatched humbly for his brother weal:\"I love this spacious cavern whereThere breathes a fresh and pleasant air.Brave brother, let us here remainThroughout the season of the rain.For in mine eyes this mountain crestIs above all, the loveliest.Where copper-hued and black and whiteShow the huge blocks that face the height;Where gleams the shine of varied ore,Where dark clouds hang and torrents roar;Where waving woods are fair to see,And creepers climb from tree to tree;Where the gay peacock voice is shrill,And sweet birds carol on the hill;Where odorous breath is wafted farFrom Jessamine and Sinduvár;(617)And opening flowers of every hueGive wondrous beauty to the view.See, too, this pleasant water nearOur cavern home is fresh and clear;And lilies gay with flower and budAre glorious on the lovely flood.This cave that fares north and eastWill shelter us till rain has ceased;And towering hills that rise behindWill screen us from the furious wind.Close by the cavern portal liesAnd level stone of ample sizeAnd sable hue, a mighty blockLong severed from the parent rock.Now let thine eye bent northward restA while upon that mountain crest,High as a cloud that brings the rain,And dark as iron rent in twain.Look southward, brother, now and viewA cloudy pile of paler hueLike Mount Kailása topmost heightWhere ores of every tint are bright.See, Lakshman, see before our caveThat clear brook eastward roll its waveAs though \\'twere Gangá infant rillDown streaming from the three-peaked hill.See, by the water gentle flowAsoka, sál, and sandal grow.And every lovely tree most fairWith leaf and bud and flower is there.See there, beneath the bending treesThat fringe her bank, the river flees,Clothed with their beauty like a maidIn all her robes and gems arrayed,While from the sedgy banks are heardThe soft notes of each amorous bird.O see what lovely islets studLike gems the bosom of the flood,And sárases and wild swans crowdAbout her till she laughs aloud.See, lotus blooms the brook o\\'erspread,Some tender blue, some dazzling red,And opening lilies white as snowTheir buds in rich profusion show.There rings the joyous peacock scream,There stands the curlew by the stream,And holy hermits love to throngWhere the sweet waters speed along.Ranged on the grassy margin shineGay sandal trees in glittering line,And all the wondrous verdure seemsThe offspring of creative dreams.O conquering Prince, there cannot beA lovelier place than this we see.Here sheltered on the beauteous heightOur days will pass in calm delight.Nor is Kishkindhá city, gayWith grove and garden, far away.Thence will the breeze of evening bringSweet music as the minstrels sing;And, when the Vánars dance, will comeThe sound of tabour and of drum.Again to spouse and realm restored,Girt by his friends, the Vánar lordGreat glory has acquired; and howCan he be less than happy now?\"This said, the son of Raghu madeHis dwelling in that pleasant shadeUpon the mountain shelving sideThat sweetly all his wants supplied.But still the hero troubled mindNo comfort in his woe could find,Yet mourning for his stolen wifeDearer to Ráma than his life,Chief when he saw the Lord of NightRise slowly o\\'er the eastern height,He tossed upon his leafy bedWith eyes by sleep unvisited.Outwelled the tears in ceaseless flow,And every sense was numbed by woe.Each pang that pierced the mourner throughSmote Lakshman faithful bosom too,Who, troubled for his brother sake,With wisest words the prince bespake:\"Arise, my brother, and be strong:Thy hero heart has mourned too long.Thou knowest well that tears and sighsWill mar the mightiest enterprise.Thine was the soul that loved to dare:To serve the Gods was still thy care;And ne\\'er may sorrow sting subdueA heart so resolute and true.How canst thou hope to slay in fightThe giant cruel in his might?Unwearied must the champion beWho strives with such a foe as he.Tear out this sorrow by the root;Again be bold and resolute.Arise, my brother, and subdueThe demon and his wicked crew.Thou canst destroy the earth, her seas,Her rooted hills and giant treesUnseated by thy furious hand:And shall one fiend thy power withstand?Wait through this season of the rainTill suns of autumn dry the plain,Then shall thy giant foe, and allHis host and realm, before thee fall.I wake thy valour that has sleptAmid the tears thine eyes have wept;As drops of oil in worship raiseThe dormant flame to sudden blaze.\"The son of Raghu heard: he knewHis brother rede was wise and true;And, honouring his friendly guide,In gentle words he thus replied:\"Whate\\'er a hero firm and bold,Devoted, true, and lofty-souledShould speak by deep affection led,Such are the words which thou hast said.I cast away each pensive thoughtThat brings the noblest plans to naught,And each uninjured power will strainUntil the purposed end we gain.Thy prudent words will I obey,And till the close of rain-time stay,When King Sugríva will inviteTo action, and the streams be bright.The hero saved in hour of needRepays the debt with friendly deed:But hated by the good are theyWho take the boon and ne\\'er repay.\"Canto XXVIII. The Rains.\"See, brother, see\" thus Ráma criedOn Mályavat(618) dark-wooded side,\"A chain of clouds, like lofty hills,The sky with gathering shadow fills.Nine months those clouds have borne the loadConceived from sunbeams as they glowed,And, having drunk the seas, give birth,And drop their offspring on the earth.Easy it seems at such a timeThat flight of cloudy stairs to climb,And, from their summit, safely won,Hang flowery wreaths about the sun.See how the flash of evening redFringes the fleecy clouds o\\'erheadTill all the sky is streaked and linedWith bleeding wounds incarnadined,Or the wide firmament aboveShows like a lover sick with loveAnd, pale with cloudlets, heaves a sighIn the soft breeze that wanders by.See, by the fervent heat embrowned,How drenched with recent showers, the groundPours out in floods her gushing tears,Like Sítá wild with torturing fears.So softly blows this cloud-born breezeCool through the boughs of camphor treesThat one might hold it in the cupOf hollowed hands and drink it up.See, brother, where that rocky steep,Where odorous shrubs in rain-drops weep,Shows like Sugríva when they shedTne royal balm upon his head.Like students at their task appearThese hills whose misty peaks are near:Black deerskin(619) garments wrought of cloudTheir forms with fitting mantles shroud,Each torrent from the summit pouredSupplies the place of sacred cord.(620)And winds that in their caverns moanSound like the voice undertone.(621)From east to west red lightnings flash,And, quivering neath the golden lash,The great sky like a generous steedGroans inly at each call to speed.Yon lightning, as it flashes throughThe giant cloud of sable hue,Recalls my votaress Sítá pressedMid struggles to the demon breast.See, on those mountain ridges standSweet shrubs that bud and bloom expand.The soft rain ends their pangs of grief,And drops its pearls on flower and leaf.But all their raptures stab me throughAnd wake my pining love anew.(622)Now through the air no wild bird flies,Each lily shuts her weary eyes;And blooms of opening jasmin showThe parting sun has ceased to glow.No captain now for conquest burns,But homeward with his host returns;For roads and kings\\' ambitious dreamsHave vanished neath descending streams.This is the watery month(623) whereinThe Sámar(624) sacred chants begin.Áshádha(625) past, now Kosal lord(626)The harvest of the spring has stored,(627)And dwells within his palace freedFrom every care of pressing need.Full is the moon, and fierce and strongImpetuous Sarjú(628) roars alongAs though Ayodhyá crowds ran outTo greet their king with echoing shout.In this sweet time of ease and restNo care disturbs Sugríva breast,The foe that marred his peace o\\'erthrown,And queen and realm once more his own.Alas, a harder fate is mine,Reft both of realm and queen to pine,And, like the bank which floods erode,I sink beneath my sorrow load.Sore on my soul my miseries weigh,And these long rains our action stay,While Rávan seems a mightier foeThan I dare hope to overthrow.I saw the roads were barred by rain,I knew the hopes of war were vain;Nor could I bid Sugríva rise,Though prompt to aid my enterprise.E\\'en now I scarce can urge my friendOn whom his house and realm depend,Who, after toil and peril past,Is happy with his queen at last.Sugríva after rest will knowThe hour is come to strike the blow,Nor will his grateful soul forgetMy succour, or deny the debtI know his generous heart, and henceAwait the time with confidenceWhen he his friendly zeal will show,And brooks again untroubled flow.\"(629)Canto XXIX. Hanumán Counsel.No flash of lightning lit the sky,No cloudlet marred the blue on high.The Saras(630) missed the welcome rain,The moon full beams were bright again.Sugríva, lapped in bliss, forgotThe claims of faith, or heeded not;And by alluring joys misledThe path of falsehood learned to tread.In careless ease he passed each hour,And dallied in his lady bower.Each longing of his heart was stilled,And every lofty hope fulfilled.With royal Rumá by his side,Or Tárá yet a dearer bride,He spent each joyous day and nightIn revelry and wild delight,Like Indra whom the nymphs enticeTo taste the joys of Paradise.The power to courtiers\\' hands resigned,To all their acts his eyes were blind.All doubt, all fear he cast asideAnd lived with pleasure for his guide.But sage Hanúmán, firm and true,Whose heart the lore of Scripture knew,Well trained to meet occasion, trainedIn all by duty law ordained,Strove with his prudent speech to findSoft access to the monarch mind.He, skilled in every gentle artOf eloquence that wins the heart,Sugríva from his trance to wake,His salutary counsel spake:\"The realm is won, thy name advanced,The glory of thy house enhanced,And now thy foremost care should beTo aid the friends who succoured thee.He who is firm and faithful foundTo friendly ties in honour bound,Will see his name and fame increaseAnd his blest kingdom thrive in peace.Wide sway is his who truly boastsThat friends and treasure, self and hosts,All blent in one harmonious whole,Are subject to his firm control.Do thou, whose footsteps never strayFrom the clear bounds of duty way,Assist, as honour bids thee, nowThy friends, observant of thy vow.For if all cares we lay not by,And to our friend assistance fly,We, after, toil in idle haste,And all the late endeavour waste.Up! nor the promised help delayUntil the hour have slipped away.Up! and with Raghu son renewThe search for Sítá lost to view.The hour is come: he hears the call,But not on thee reproaches fallFrom him who labours to repressHis eager spirit restlessness.Long joined to thee in friendly tiesHe made thy fame and fortune rise,In gentle gifts by none excelled.In splendid might unparalleled.Up, to his succour, King! repayThe favour of that prosperous day,And to thy bravest captains sendPrompt mandates to assist thy friend.The cry for help thou wilt not spurnAlthough no grace demands return:And wilt thou not thine aid affordTo him who realm and life restored?Exert thy power, and thou hast wonThe love of Dasaratha son:And wilt thou for his summons wait,And, till he call thee, hesitate?Think not the hero needs thy powerTo save him in the desperate hour:He with his arrows could subdueThe Gods and all the demon crew,And only waits that he may seeRedeemed the promise made by thee.For thee he risked his life and fought,For thee that great deliverance wrought.Then let us trace through earth and skiesHis lady wheresoe\\'er she lies.Through realms above, beneath, we flee,And plant our footsteps on the sea.Then why, O Lord of Vánars, stillDelay us waiting for thy will?Give thy commands, O King, and sayWhat task has each and where the way.Before thee myriad Vánars standTo sweep through heaven, o\\'er seas and land.\"Sugríva heard the timely redeThat roused him in the day of need,And thus to Níla prompt and braveHis hest the imperial Vánar gave:\"Go, Níla, to the distant hostsThat keep in arms their several posts,And all the armies that protectThe quarters,(631) with their chiefs, collect.To all the luminaries placedIn intermediate regions haste,And bid each captain rise and leadHis squadrons to their king with speed.Do thou meanwhile with strictest careAll that the time requires prepare.The loitering Vánar who delaysTo gather here ere thrice five days,Shall surely die for his offence,Condemned for sinful negligence.\"Canto XXX. Ráma Lament.But Ráma in the autumn nightStood musing on the mountain height,While grief and love that scorned controlShook with wild storms the hero soul.Clear was the sky, without a cloudThe glory of the moon to shroud.And bright with purest silver shoneEach hill the soft beams looked upon.He knew Sugríva heart was bentOn pleasure, gay and negligent.He thought on Janak child forlornFrom his fond arms for ever torn.He mourned occasion slipping by,And faint with anguish heaved each sigh.He sat where many a varied streakOf rich ore marked the mountain peak.He raised his eyes the sky to view,And to his love his sad thoughts flew.He heard the Sáras cry, and faintWith sorrow poured his love-born plaint:\"She, she who mocked the softest toneOf wild birds\\' voices with her own,--Where strays she now, my love who playedSo happy in our hermit shade?How can my absent love beholdThe bright trees with their flowers of gold,And all their gleaming glory seeWith eyes that vainly look for me?How is it with my darling whenFrom the deep tangles of the glenFloat carols of each bird elateWith rapture singing to his mate?In vain my weary glances roveFrom lake to hill, from stream to grove:I find no rapture in the scene,And languish for my fawn-eyed queen.Ah, does strong love with wild unrest,Born of the autumn, stir her breast?And does the gentle lady pineTill her bright eyes shall look in mine?\"Thus Raghu son in piteous tone,O\\'erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.E\\'en as the bird that drinks the rains(632)To Indra thousand-eyed complains.Then Lakshman who had wandered throughThe copses where the berries grew,Returning to the cavern foundHis brother chief in sorrow drowned,And pitying the woes that brokeThe spirit of the hero spoke:\"Why cast thy strength of soul away,And weakly yield to passion sway?Arise, my brother, do and dareEre action perish in despair.Recall the firmness of thy heart,And nerve thee for a hero part.Whose is the hand unscathed to siezeThe red flame quickened by the breeze?Where is the foe will dare to wrongOr keep the Maithil lady long?\"Then with pale lips that sorrow driedThe son of Raghu thus replied:\"Lord Indra thousand-eyed, has sentThe sweet rain from the firmament,Sees the rich promise of the grain,And turns him to his rest again.The clouds with voices loud and deep,Veiling each tree upon the steep,Up on the thirsty earth have shedTheir precious burden and are fled.Now in kings\\' hearts ambition glows:They rush to battle with their foes;(633)But in Sugríva sloth I seeNo care for deeds of chivalry.See, Lakshman, on each breezy heightA thousand autumn blooms are bright.See how the wings of wild swans gleamOn every islet of the stream.Four months of flood and rain are past:A hundred years they seemed to lastTo me whom toil and trouble tried,My Sítá severed from my side.She, gentlest woman, weak and young,Still to her lord unwearied clung.Still by the exile side she stoodIn the wild ways of Dandak wood,Like a fond bird disconsolateIf parted from her darling mate.Sugríva, lapped in soft repose,Untouched by pity for my woes,Scorns the poor exile, dispossessed,By Rávan mightier arm oppressed,The wretch who comes to sue and prayFrom his lost kingdom far away.Hence falls on me the Vánar scorn,A suitor friendless and forlorn.The time is come: with heedless eyeHe sees the hour of action fly,--Unmindful, now his hopes succeed,Of promise made in stress of need.Go seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,Forgetful of his royal oath,And as mine envoy thus upbraidThe monarch for his help delayed:\"Vile is the wretch who will not payThe favour of an earlier day,Hope in the supplicant breast awakes,And then his plighted promise breaks.Noblest, mid all of women born,Who keeps the words his lips have sworn,Yea, if those words be good or ill,Maintains his faith unbroken still.The thankless who forget to aidThe friend who helped them when they prayed,Dishonoured in their death shall lie,And dogs shall pass their corpses by.Sure thou wouldst see my strained arm holdMy bow of battle backed with gold,Wouldst gaze upon its awful formLike lightning flashing through the storm,And hear the clanging bowstring loudAs thunder from a labouring cloud.\"His valour and his strength I know:But pleasure sway now sinks them low,With thee, my brother, for allyThat strength and valour I defy.He promised, when the rains should end,The succour of his arm to lend.Those months are past: he dares forget,And, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet.No thought disturbs his careless breastFor us impatient and distressed,And, while we sadly wait and pine,Girt by his lords he quaffs the wine.Go, brother, go, his palace seek,And boldly to Sugríva speak,Thus give the listless king to knowWhat waits him if my anger glow:Still open, to the gloomy God,Lies the sad path that Báli trod.\"Still to thy plighted word be true,Lest thou, O King, that path pursue.I launched the shaft I pointed well.And Báli, only Báli, fell.But, if from truth thou dare to stray,Both thee and thine this hand shall slay.\"Thus be the Vánar king addressed,Then add thyself what seems the best.\"Canto XXXI. The Envoy.Thus Ráma spoke, and Lakshman thenMade answer to the prince of men:\"Yea, if the Vánar, undeterredBy fear of vengeance, break his word,Loss of his royal power ere longShall pay the traitor for the wrong.Nor deem I him so void of senseTo brave the bitter consequence.But if enslaved to joy he lie,And scorn thy grace with blinded eye,Then let him join his brother slain:Unmeet were such a wretch to reign.Quick rises, kindling in my breast,The wrath that will not be repressed,And bids me in my fury slayThe breaker of his faith to-day.Let Báli son thy consort traceWith bravest chiefs of Vánar race.\"Thus spoke the hero, and aglowWith rage of battle seized his bow.But Ráma thus in gentler moodWith fitting words his speech renewed:\"No hero with a soul like thineTo paths of sin will e\\'er incline,He who his angry heart can tameIs worthiest of a hero name.Not thine, my brother, be the partSo alien from the tender heart,Nor let thy feet by wrath misledForsake the path they loved to tread.From harsh and angry words abstain:With gentle speech a hearing gain,And tax Sugríva with the crimeOf failing faith and wasted time.\"Then Lakshman, bravest of the brave,Obeyed the hest that Ráma gave,To whom devoting every thoughtThe Vánar royal town he sought.As Mandar mountain heaves on highHis curved peak soaring to the sky,So Lakshman showed, his dread bow bentLike Indra(634) in the firmament.His brother wrath, his brother woeInflamed his soul to fiercest glow.The tallest trees to earth were castAs furious on his way he passed,And where he stepped, so fiercely fleet,The stones were shivered by his feet.He reached Kishkindhá city deepEmbosomed where the hills were steep,Where street and open square were linedWith legions of the Vánar kind.Then, as his lips with fury swelled,The lord of Raghu line beheldA stream of Vánar chiefs outpouredTo do obeisance to their lord.But when the mighty prince in viewOf the thick coming Vánars drew,They turned them in amaze to seizeCrags of the rock and giant trees.He saw, and fiercer waxed his ire,As oil lends fury to the fire.Scarce had the Vánar chieftains seenThat wrathful eye, that troubled mienFierce as the God who rules the dead,When, turned in wild affright, they fled.Speeding in breathless terror allSought King Sugríva council hall,And there made known their tale of fear,That Lakshman wild with rage, was near.The king, untroubled by alarms,Held Tárá in his amorous arms,And in the distant bower with herHeard not each clamorous messenger.Then, summoned at the lords\\' behestForth from the city portals pressed,Each like some elephant or cloud,The Vánars in a trembling crowd:Fierce warriors all with massive jawsAnd terrors of their tiger claws,Some matched ten elephants, and someA hundred strength could overcome.Some chieftains, mightier than the rest,Ten times a hundred force possessed.With eyes of fury Lakshman viewedThe Vánars\\' tree-armed multitude.Thus garrisoned from side to sideThe city walls assault defied.Beyond the moat that girt the wallAdvanced the Vánar chiefs; and allUpon the plain in firm brigade,Impetuous warriors, stood arrayed.Red at the sight flashed Lakshman eyes,His bosom heaved tumultuous sighs,And forth the fire of fury brokeLike flame that flashes through the smoke.Like some fierce snake the hero stood:His bow recalled the expanded hood,And in his shaft-head bright and keenThe flickering of its tongue was seen:And in his own all-conquering mightThe venom of its deadly bite.Prince Angad marked his angry look,And every hope his heart forsook.Then, his large eyes with fury red,To Angad Lakshman turned and said:\"Go tell the king that Lakshman waitsFor audience at the city gates,Whose heart, O tamer of thy foes,Is heavy with his brother woes.Bid him to Ráma word attend,And ask if he will aid his friend.Go, let the king my message learn:Then hither with all speed return.\"Prince Angad heard and wild with griefCried as he looked upon the chief:\"\\'Tis Lakshman self: impelled by ireHe seeks the city of my sire.\"At the fierce words and furious lookOf Raghu son he quailed and shook.Back through the city gates he sped,And, laden with the tale of dread,Sought King Sugríva, filled his earsAnd Rumá with his doubts and fears.To Rumá and the king he bent,And clasped their feet most reverent,Clasped the dear feet of Tárá, too,And told the startling tale anew.But King Sugríva ear was dulled,By love and wine and languor lulled,Nor did the words that Angad spakeThe slumberer from his trance awake.But soon as Raghu son came nighThe startled Vánars raised a cry,And strove to win his grace, while dreadEach anxious heart disquieted.They saw, and, as they gathered round,Rose from the mighty throng a soundLike torrents when they downward dash,Or thunder with the lightning flash.The shouting of the Vánars brokeSugríva slumber, and he woke:Still with the wine his eyes were red,His neck with flowers was garlanded.Roused at the voice of Angad cameTwo Vánar lords of rank and fame;One Yaksha, one Prabháva hight,--Wise counsellors of gain and right.They came and raised their voices high,And told that Raghu son was nigh:\"Two brothers steadfast in their truth,Each glorious in the bloom of youth,Worthy of rule, have left the skies,And clothed their forms in men disguise.One at thy gates, in warlike handsHolding his mighty weapon, stands.His message is the charioteerThat brings the eager envoy near,Urged onward by his bold intent,And by the hest of Ráma sent.\"The gathered Vánars saw and fled,And raised aloud their cry of dread.Son of Queen Tárá, Angad ranTo parley with the godlike man.Still fiery-eyed with rage and hateStands Lakshman at the city gate,And trembling Vánars scarce can flyScathed by the lightning of his eye.\"Go with thy son, thy kith and kin,The favour of the prince to win,And bow thy reverent head that soHis fiery wrath may cease to glow.What righteous Ráma bids thee, do,And to thy plighted word be true.\"Canto XXXII. Hanumán Counsel.Sugríva heard, and, trained and triedIn counsel, to his lords replied:\"No deed of mine, no hasty wordThe anger of the prince has stirred.But haply some who hate me stillAnd watch their time to work me ill,Have slandered me to Raghu son,Accused of deeds I ne\\'er have done.Now, O my lords--for you are wise--Speak truly what your hearts advise,And, pondering each event, inquireThe reason of the prince ire.No fear have I of Lakshman: none:No dread of Raghu mightier son.But wrath, that fires a friendly breastWithout due cause, disturbs my rest.With labour light is friendship gained,But with severest toil maintained.And doubt is strong, and faith is weak,And friendship dies when traitors speak.Hence is my troubled bosom coldWith fear of Ráma lofty-souled;For heavy on my spirit weighHis favours I can ne\\'er repay.\"He ceased: and Hanumán of allThe Vánars in the council hallIn wisdom first, and rank, expressedThe thoughts that filled his prudent breast:\"No marvel thou rememberest yetThe service thou shouldst ne\\'er forget,How the brave prince of Raghu seedThy days from fear and peril freed;And Báli for thy sake o\\'erthrew,Whom Indra self might scarce subdue.I doubt not Ráma anger burnsFor the scant love thy heart returns.For this he sends his brother, himWhose glory never waxes dim.Sunk in repose thy careless eyeMarks not the seasons as they fly,Nor sees that autumn has begunWith dark blooms opening to the sun.Clear is the sky: no cloudlet marsThe splendour of the shining stars.The balmy air is soft and still,And clear and bright are lake and rill.Thou heedest not with blinded eyesThe hour for warlike enterprise.Hence Lakshman hither comes to breakThy slothful trance and bid thee wake.Then, Monarch, with a patient earThe high-souled Ráma message hear,Which, reft of wife and realm and friends,Thus by another mouth he sends.Thou, Vánar King, hast done amiss:And now I see no way but this:Before his envoy humbly standAnd sue for peace with suppliant hand.High duty bids a courtier seekHis master weal, and freely speak.So by no thought of fear controlledMy speech, O King, is free and bold,For Ráma, if his anger glow,Can, with the terrors of his bowThis earth with all the Gods subdue,Gandharvas,(635) and the demon crew.Unwise to stir his wrathful moodWhose favour must again be wooed.And, most of all, unwise for oneGrateful like thee for service done.Go with thy son and kinsmen: bendThy humble head and greet thy friend.And, like a fond obedient spouse,Be faithful to thy plighted vows.\"Canto XXXIII. Lakshman Entry.Through the fair city Lakshman came,Invited in Sugríva name.Within the gates the guardian bands,Of Vánars raised their suppliant hands,And in their ordered ranks, amazed,Upon the princely hero gazed,They marked each burning breath he drew,The fury of his soul they knew.Their hearts were chilled with sudden fear:They gazed, but dared not venture near,Before his eyes the city, gayWith gems and flowery gardens, lay,Where fane and palace rose on high,And things of beauty charmed the eye.Where trees of every blossom grewYielding their fruit in season dueTo Vánars of celestial seedWho wore each varied form at need,Fair-faced and glorious with the shineOf heavenly robes and wreaths divine.There sandal, aloe, lotus bloomed,And there delicious breath perfumedThe city broad street, redolentOf sugary mead(636) and honey scent.There many a lofty palace roseLike Vindhya or the Lord of Snows,And with sweet murmur sparkling rillsLeapt lightly down the sheltering hills.On many a glorious palace, raisedFor prince and noble,(637) Lakshman gazed:Like clouds of paly hue they shoneWith fragrant wreaths that hung thereon:There wealth of jewels was enshrined,And fairer gems of womankind.There gleamed, of noble height and size,Like Indra mansion in the skies,Protected by a crystal fenceOf rock, the royal residence,With roof and turret high and brightLike Mount Kailása loftiest height.There blooming trees, Mahendra gift,High o\\'er the walls were seen to liftTheir golden fruited boughs, that madeWith leaf and flower delicious shade.He saw a band of Vánars wait,Wielding their weapons, at the gateWhere golden portals flashed betweenCelestial garlands red and green.Within Sugríva fair abodeUnchecked the mighty hero strode,As when the sun of autumn shroudsHis glory in a pile of clouds.Through seven wide courts he quickly passed,And reached the royal tower at last,Where seats were set with couch and bedOf gold and silver richly spread.While the young chieftain feet drew nearThe sound of music reached his ear,As the soft breathings of the fluteCame blending with the voice and lute.Then beauty showed her youth and graceAnd varied charm of form and face:Soft bright-eyed creatures, fair and young,--Gay garlands round their necks were hung,And greater charms to each were lentBy richest dress and ornament.He saw the calm attendants waitAbout their lord in careless state,Heard women girdles chime in sweetAccordance with their tinkling feet.He heard the anklet silvery sound,He saw the calm that reigned around,And o\\'er him, as he listened, cameA rush of rage, a flood of shame.He drew his bowstring: with the clangFrom ease to west the welkin rang:Then in his modest mood withdrewA little from the ladies\\' view.And sternly silent stood apart,While wrath for Ráma filled his heart.Sugríva knew the sounding string,And at the call the Vánar kingSprang swiftly from his golden seat,And feared the coming prince to meet.Then with cold lips that terror driedTo beauteous Tárá thus he cried:\"What cause of anger, O my spouseFair with the charm of lovely brows,Sets Lakshman gentle breast on fire,And brings him in unwonted ire?Say, canst thou see, O faultless dame,A cause to fill his soul with flame?For there must be a reason whenSuch fury stirs the king of men.Reveal the sin, if sin of mineAnger the lord of Raghu line.Or go thyself, his rage subdue,And with soft words his favour woo.Soon as on thee his eyes are setHis heart this anger will forget,For men like him of lofty mindAre never stern with womankind.First let thy gentle speech disarmHis fury, and his spirit charm,And I, from fear of peril free,The conqueror of his foes will see.\"She heard: with faltering steps and slow,With eyes that shone with trembling glow,With gold-girt body gently bentTo meet the stranger prince she went.When Lakshman saw the Vánar queenWith tranquil eyes and modest mien,Before the dame he bent his head,And anger, at her presence, fled.Made bold by draughts of wine, and cheeredBy Lakshman look no more she feared,And in the trust his favour lentShe thus addressed him eloquent:\"Whence springs thy burning fury? say:Who dares thy will to disobey?Who checks the maddened flames that seizeOn forests full of withered trees?\"Then Lakshman spoke, her mind to ease,His kind reply in words like these:\"Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,Heedless of duty and of friends,Nor dost thou mark, though fondly true,The evil path his steps pursue.He cares not for affairs of state,Nor us forlorn and desolate,But sits a mere spectator still,A sensual slave to pleasure will.Four months were fixed, the time agreedWhen he should help us in our need:But, bound in toils of pleasure fast,He sees not that the months are past.Where beats the heart which draughts of wineTo virtue or to gain incline?Hast thou not heard those draughts destroyVirtue and gain and love and joy?For those who, helped at need, refuseTheir aid in turn, their virtue lose:And they who scorn a friend disdainA treasure naught may buy again.Thy lord has cast his friend away,Nor feared from virtue path to stray,If this be true, declare, O dameWho knowest duty every claim,What further work remains for usDeceived and disappointed thus.\"She listened, for his words were kind,Where virtue showed with gain combined,And thus in turn the prince addressed,As hope was rising in his breast:\"No time, no cause of wrath I seeWith those who live and honour thee:And thou shouldst bear without offenceThy servant fitful negligence.I know the seasons glide away,While Ráma maddens at delayI know what deed our thanks has earned,I know that grace should be returned.But still I know, whate\\'er befall,That conquering love is lord of all;Know where Sugríva thoughts, possessedBy one absorbing passion, rest.But he whom sensual joys debaseHeeds not the claim of time and place,And sees not with his blinded sightHis duty or his gain aright.O pardon him who loves me! spareThe Vánar caught in pleasure snare,And once again let Ráma graceWith favour him who rules our race.E\\'en royal saints, whose chief delightWas penance and austerest rite,At love commandment have unbent,Beguiled by sweetest blandishment.And know, Sugríva, roused at last,The order to his lords has passed,And, long by love and bliss delayed,Wakes all on fire your hopes to aid.A countless host his city fills,New-gathered from a thousand hills:Impetuous chiefs, who wear at needEach varied form, his legions lead.Come then, O hero, kept aloofBy modest awe, nor fear reproof:A faithful friend untouched by blameMay look upon another dame.\"He passed within, by Tárá pressed,And by his own impatient breast,Refulgent there in sunlike sheenSugríva on his throne was seen.Gay garlands round his neck were twined,And Rumá by her lord recline.Canto XXXIV. Lakshman Speech.Sugríva started from his restWith doubt and terror in his breast.He heard the prince furious treadHe saw his eyes glow fiercely red.Swift sprang the monarch to his feetUpstarting from his golden seat.Rose Rumá and her fellows, too,And closely round Sugríva drew,As round the moon full glory standAttendant stars in glittering band.Sugríva glanced with reddened eyes,Raised his joined hands in suppliant guiseFlew to the door, and rooted thereStood like the tree that grants each prayer.(638)And Lakshman saw, and, fiercely moved,With angry speech the king reproved:\"Famed is the prince who loves the truth,Whose soul is touched with tender ruth,Who, liberal, keeps each sense subdued,And pays the debt of gratitude.But all unmeet a king to be,The meanest of the mean is heWho basely breaks the promise madeTo trusting friends who lent him aid.He sins who for a steed has lied,As if a hundred steeds had died:Or if he lie, a cow to win,Tenfold as heavy is the sin.But if the lie a man betray,Both he and his shall all decay.(639)O Vánar King, the thankless manIs worthy of the general ban,Who takes assistance of his friends,And in his turn no service lends.This verse of old by Brahmá sungIs echoed now by every tongue.Hear what He cried in angry moodBewailing man ingratitude:\"For draughts of wine, for slaughtered cows,For treacherous theft, for broken vowsA pardon is ordained: but noneFor thankless scorn of service done.\"Ungrateful, Vánar King, art thou,And faithless to thy plighted vow.For Ráma brought thee help, and yetThou shunnest to repay the debt:Or, grateful, thou hadst surely pressedTo aid the hero in his quest.Thou art, in vulgar pleasures drowned,False to thy bond in honour bound.Nor yet has Ráma guileless heartDiscerned thee for the thing thou art--A snake who holds the frogs that criesAnd lures fresh victims as it dies.Brave Ráma, born for glorious fate,Has set thee in thy high estate,And to the Vánars\\' throne restored,Great-souled himself, their mean-souled lord.Now if thy pride disown what he,High thoughted prince, has done for thee,Struck by his arrows shalt thou fall,And Báli meet in Yáma hall.Still open, to the gloomy God,Lies the sad path thy brother trod.Then to thy plighted word be true,Nor let thy steps that path pursue.Methinks the shafts of Ráma, shotLike thunderbolts, thou heedest not,Who canst, absorbed in sensual bliss,Thy promise from thy mind dismiss.\"Canto XXXV. Tárá Speech.He ceased: and Tárá starry-eyedThus to the angry prince replied:\"Not to my lord shouldst thou addressA speech so fraught with bitterness:Not thus reproached my lord should be,And least of all, O Prince, by thee.He is no thankless coward--no--With spirit dead to valour glow.From paths of truth he never strays,Nor wanders in forbidden ways.Ne\\'er will Sugríva heart forget,By Ráma saved, the lasting debt.Still in his grateful breast will liveThe succour none but he could give.Restored to fame by Ráma grace,To empire o\\'er the Vánar race,From ceaseless dread and toil set free,Restored to Rumá and to me:By grief and care and exile tried,New to the bliss so long denied,Like Visvámitra once, alas,He marks not how the seasons pass.That saint ten thousand years remained,By sweet Ghritáchí(640) love enchained,And deemed those years, that flew awaySo lightly, but a single day.O, if those years unheeded flewBy him who times and seasons knew,Unequalled for his lofty mind,What marvel meaner eyes are blind?Then be not angry, Raghu son,And let thy brother feel for oneWho many a weary year has spentStranger to love and blandishment.Let not this wrath thy soul inflame,Like some mean wretch unknown to fame:For high and noble hearts like thineLove mercy and to ruth incline,Calm and deliberate, and slowWith anger raging fire to glow.At length, O righteous prince, relent,Nor let my words in vain be spent,This sudden blaze of fury slake,I pray thee for Sugríva sake.He would renounce at Ráma callRumá and Angad, me and allWho call him lord: his gold and grain,The favour of his friend to gain.His arm shall slay the fiend more baseIn soul than all his impious race,And happy Ráma reuniteTo Sítá, rival in delightOf the triumphant Moon when heRejoins his darling Rohiní.(641)Ten million million demons guardThe gates of Lanká firmly barred.All hope until that host be slain,To smite the robber king is vain.Nor with Sugríva aid aloneMay king and host be overthrown.Thus ere he died--for well he knew--Spake Báli, and his words are true.I know not what his proofs might be,But speak the words he spake to me.Hence far and wide our lords are sentTo raise the mightiest armament,For their return Sugríva waitsEre he can sally from his gates.Still is the oath Sugríva sworeKept firmly even as before:And the great host this day will beAssembled by the king decree,Ten thousand thousand troops, who wearThe form of monkey and of bear,Prepared for thee the war to wage:Then let thy wrath no longer rage.The matrons of the Vánar raceSee marks of fury in thy face;They see thine eyes like blood are red,And will not yet be comforted.\"Canto XXXVI. Sugríva Speech.She ceased: and Lakshman gave assent,Won by her gentle argument.So Tárá pleading, just and mild,His softening heart had reconciled.His altered mood Sugríva saw,And cast aside the fear and aweLike raiment heavy with the rainWhich on his troubled soul had lain.Then quickly to the ground he threwHis flowery garland, bright of hue,Which round his royal neck he wore,And, sobered, was himself once more.Then turning to the princely manIn soothing words the king began:\"My glory, wealth, and royal swayTo other hands had passed away:But Ráma to my rescue came,And gave me back my power and fame.O Lakshman, say, whose grateful heartCould nurse the hope to pay in part,By service of a life, the deedOf Ráma sprung of heavenly seed?His foeman Rávan shall be slain,And Sítá shall be his again.The hero side I will not leave,But he the conquest shall achieve.What need of help has he who drewHis bow, and one great arrow flewThrough seven tall trees, a mountain rent,And cleft the earth with force unspent?What aid needs he who shook his bow,And at the sound the earth belowWith hill and wood and rooted rockQuaked feverous with the thunder shock?Yet all my legions will I bring,And follow close the warrior kingMarching on his impetuous wayFierce Rávan and his hosts to slay.If I be guilty of offence,Careless through love or negligence,Let him his loyal slave forgive;For error cleaves to all who live.\"Thus king Sugríva, good and brave,In humble words his answer gave,Softened was Lakshman angry moodWho thus his friendly speech renewed:\"My brother, Vánar King, will seeA champion and a friend in thee.So strong art thou, so brave and bold,So pure in thought, so humble-souled,That thou deservest well to reignAnd all a monarch bliss to gain.Lend thou my brother aid, and allHis foes beneath his arm will fall.Full well the words thou speakest suitA chieftain wise and resolute.With grateful heart that loves the right,And foot that never yields in fight.O come, and my sad brother cheerWho mourns the wife he holds so dear.O pardon, friend, my harsh address,And Ráma frantic bitterness.\"Canto XXXVII. The Gathering.He ceased: and King Sugríva criedTo sage Hanúmán(642) by his side:\"Summon the Vánar legions, thoseWho dwell about the Lord of Snows:Those who in Vindhyan groves delight,Kailása, or Mahendra height,Dwell on the Five bright Peaks, or whereMandar white summit cleaves the air:Wherever they are wandring freeIn highlands by the western sea,On that east hill whence springs the sun,Or where he sinks when day is done.Call the great chiefs whose legions fillThe forests of the Lotus Hill,(643)Where every one in strength and sizeWith the stupendous Anjan(644) vies.Call those, with tints of burnished goldWhom Mahásaila caverns hold:Those who on Dhúmra roam, or hideIn the wild woods on Meru side.Call those who, brilliant as the sun,On high Mahárun leap and run,Quaffing sweet juices that distilFrom odorous trees upon the hill,Call those whom tranquil haunts delight,Where dwell the sage and anchoriteIn groves that through their wide extentExhale a thousand blossoms\\' scent.Send out, send out: from coast to coastAssemble all the Vánar host:With force, with words, with gifts of priceCompel, admonish and entice.Already envoys have been sentTo warn them of their lord intent.Let others urged by thee repeatMy mandate that their steps be fleet.Those lords who yielding to the swayOf love delight would fain delay,Urge hither with the utmost speed,Or with thee to my presence lead:And those who linger to the lastUntil ten days be come and passed,And dare their sovereign to defy,For their offence shall surely die.Thousands, yea millions, shall there be,Obedient to their king decree,The lions of the Vánar race,Assembled from each distant place,Forth shall they haste like hills in size,Or mighty clouds that veil the skies,And swiftly speeding on their wayBring all our legions in array.\"He ceased: the son of Váyu(645) heard,Submissive to his sovereign word;And sent his rapid envoys forthTo east and west and south and north.They bent their airy course afarAlong the paths of bird and star,And sped through ether farther yetWhere Vishnu splendid sphere is set.(646)By sea, on hill, by wood and lakeThey called to arms for Ráma sake,As each with terror in his breastObeyed his awful king behest.Three million Vánars, fierce and strongAs Anjan self, a wondrous throngSped from the spot where Ráma stillGazed restless from the woody hill.Ten million others, brave and bold,With coats that shone like burning gold,Came flying from the mountain crestWhere sinks the weary sun to rest.Impetuous from the northern skies,Where Mount Kailása summits rise,Ten hundred millions hasted, huedLike manes of lions, ne\\'er subdued:The dwellers on Himálaya side,Whose food his roots and fruit supplied,With rangers of the Vindhyan chainAnd neighbours of the Milky Main.(647)Some from the palm groves where they fed,Some from the woods of betel sped:In countless numbers, fierce and brave,They came from mountain, lake, and cave.As on their way the Vánars wentTo rouse each distant armament,They chanced that wondrous tree to viewThat on Himálaya summit grew.Of old upon that sacred heightWas wrought Mahesvar(648) glorious rite,Which every God in heaven beheld,And his glad heart with triumph swelled.There from pure seed at random sownBright plants with luscious fruit had grown,And, sweet as Amrit to the taste,The summit of the mountain graced.Who once should eat the virtuous fruitThat sprang from so divine a root,One whole revolving moon should beFrom every pang of hunger free.The Vánars culled the fruit they foundRipe on the sacrificial groundWith rare celestial odours sweet,To lay them at Sugríva feet.Those noble envoys scoured the landTo summon every Vánar bandThen swiftly homeward at the headOf countless armaments they sped.They gathered by Kishkindhá wall.They thronged Sugríva palace hall,And, richly laden, bare withinThat fruit of heavenly origin.Their gifts before their king they spread,And thus in tones of triumph said:\"Through every land our way we tookTo visit hill and wood and brook,And all thy hosts from east to westFlock hither at their lord behest.\"Sugríva with delighted lookThe present of his envoys took,Then bade them go, with gracious speechRewarding and dismissing each.Canto XXXVIII. Sugríva Departure.Thus all the princely Vánars, trueTo their appointed tasks, withdrew.Sugríva deemed already doneThe work he planned for Raghu son.Then Lakshman gently spoke and cheeredSugríva for his valour feared:\"Now, chieftain, if thy will be so,Forth from Kishkindhá let us go.\"Sugríva heart swelled high with prideAs to the prince he thus replied:\"Come, speed we forth without delay:\\'Tis mine thy mandate to obey.\"Sugríva bade the dames adieu,And Tárá and the rest withdrew.Then at their chieftain summons cameThe Vánars first in rank and fame,A trusty brave and reverent band,Meet e\\'en before a queen to stand.They at his call made haste to bringThe litter of the glorious king.\"Mount, O my friend.\" Sugríva cried,And straight Sumitrá son complied.Then took by Lakshman side his placeThe sovereign of the woodland race,Upraised by Vánars, fleet and strong,Who bore the glittering load along.On high above his royal headA paly canopy was spread,And chouries white in many a handThe forehead of the monarch fanned,And shell and drum and song and shoutPealed round him as the king passed out.About the monarch went a throngOf Vánar warriors brave and strong,As onward to the mountain shadeWhere Ráma dwelt his way he made.Soon as the lovely spot he viewedWhere Ráma lived in solitude,The Vánar monarch, far-renowed,With Lakshman, lightly stepped to ground,And to the son of Raghu wentJoining his raised hands reverent.As their great leader raised his hands,So suppliant stood the Vánar bands.Well pleased the son of Raghu sawThose legions, hushed in reverent awe,Stand silent like the tranquil floodsThat raise their hands of lotus buds.But Ráma, when the king, to greetHis friend, had bowed him at his feet,Raised him who ruled the Vánar race,And held him in a close embrace:Then, when his arms he had unknit,Besought him by his side to sit,And thus with gentle words the bestOf men the Vánar king addressed:\"The prince who well his days divides,And knows aright the times and tidesTo follow duty, joy, or gain,He, only he, deserves to reign.But he who wealth and virtue leaves,And every hour to pleasure cleaves,Falls from his bliss like him who wakesFrom slumber on a branch that breaks.True king is he who smites his foes,And favour to his servants shows,And of that fruit makes timely useWhich virtue, wealth, and joy produce.The hour is come that bids thee riseTo aid me in my enterprise.Then call thy nobles to debate,And with their help deliberate.\"\"Lost was my power,\" the king replied,\"All strength had fled, all hope had died.The Vánars owned another lord,But by thy grace was all restored.All this, O conqueror of the foe,To thee and Lakshman aid I owe.And his should be the villain shameWho durst deny the sacred claim.These Vánar chiefs of noblest birthHave at my bidding roamed the earth,And brought from distant regions allOur legions at their monarch call:Fierce bears with monkey troops combined,And apes of every varied kind,Terrific in their forms, who dwellIn grove and wood and bosky dell:The bright Gandharvas\\' brood, the seedOf Gods,(649) they change their shapes at need.Each with his legions in array,Hither, O Prince, they make their way.They come: and tens of millions swellTo numbers that no tongue may tell.(650)For thee their armies will uniteWith chiefs, Mahendra peers in might.From Meru and from Vindhya chainThey come like clouds that bring the rain.These round thee to the war will go,To smite to earth thy demon foe;Will slay the Rákshas and restoreThy consort when the fight is o\\'er.\"Canto XXXIX. The Vánar Host.Then Ráma, best of all who guideTheir steps by duty, thus replied:\"What marvel if Lord Indra sendThe kindly rain, O faithful friend?If, thousand-rayed, the God of DayDrive every darksome cloud away?Or, rising high, the Lord of NightFlood the broad heaven with silver light?What marvel, King, that one like theeThe glory of his friends should be?No marvel, O my lord, that thouHast shown thy noble nature now.Thy heart, Sugríva, well I know:Naught from thy lips but truth may flow,With thee for friend and champion allMy foes beneath my arm will fall.The Rákshas, when my queen he stole,Brought sure destruction on his soul,Like Anuhláda(651) who beguiledQueen Sachí called Puloma child.Yes, near, Sugríva, is the dayWhen I my demon foe shall slay,As conquering Indra in his ireSlew Queen Paulomí haughty sire.\"(652)He ceased: thick clouds of dust rose highTo every quarter of the sky:The very sun grew faint and paleBehind the darkly-gathering veil.The mighty clouds that hung o\\'erheadFrom east to west thick darkness spread,And earth to her foundations shookWith hill and forest, lake and brook.Then hidden was the ground beneathFierce warriors armed with fearful teeth,Hosts numberless, each lord in sizeA match for him who rules the skies:From many a sea and distant hill,From rock and river, lake and rill.Some like the morning sun were bright,Some, like the moon, were silver white:These green as lotus fibres, thoseWhite-coated from their native snows.(653)Then Satabali came in viewGirt by a countless retinue.Like some gold mountain high in airTárá illustrious sire(654) was there.There Rumá father,(655) far-renowned,With tens of thousands ranged around.There, tinted like the tender greenOf lotus filaments, was seen,Compassed by countless legions, oneWhose face was as the morning sun,Hanúmán father good and great,Kesarí,(656) wisest in debate.There the proud king Gaváksha, fearedFor his strong warrior arm, appeared.There Dhúmra, mighty lord, the dreadOf foes, his ursine legions led.There Panas, first for warlike fame,With twenty million warriors came.There glorious Níla, dark of hue,Arrayed his countless troops in view.There moved lord Gavaya brave and bold,Resplendent like a hill of gold,And near him Darímukha stoodWith millions from the hill and woodAnd Dwivid famed for strength and speed,And Mamda, both of Asvin seed.There Gaja, strong and glorious, ledThe countless troops around him spread,And Jámbaván(657) the king whose swayThe bears delighted to obey,With swarming myriads onward pressedTrue to his lord Sugríva hest;And princely Ruman, dear to fame,Led millions whom no hosts could tame,All these and many a chief beside(658)Came onward fierce in warlike pride.They covered all the plain, and stillPressed forward over wood and hill.In rows for many a league aroundThey rested on the grassy ground;Or to Sugríva made their way,Like clouds about the Lord of Day,And to the king their proud heads bentIn power and might preeminent.Sugríva then to Ráma sped,And raised his reverent hands, and saidThat every chief from coast to coastWas present with his warrior host.Canto XL. The Army Of The East.With practised eye the king reviewedThe Vánars\\' countless multitude,And, joying that his hest was done,Thus spake to Raghu mighty son:\"See, all the Vánar hosts who fearMy sovereign might are gathered here.Chiefs strong as Indra self, who speedWher\\'er they list, these armies lead.Fierce and terrific to the viewAs Daityas or the Dánav(659) crew,Famed in all lands for souls afireWith lofty thoughts, they never tire,O\\'er hill and vale they wander free,And islets of the distant sea.And these gathered myriads, allWill serve thee, Ráma, at thy call.Whate\\'er thy heart advises, say:Thy mandates will the host obey.\"Then answered Ráma, as he pressedThe Vánar monarch to his breast:\"O search for my lost Sítá, striveTo find her if she still survive:And in thy wondrous wisdom traceFierce Rávan to his dwelling-place.And when by toil and search we knowWhere Sítá lies and where the foe,With thee, dear friend, will I deviseFit means to end the enterprise.Not mine, not Lakshman is the powerTo guide us in the doubtful hour.Thou, sovereign of the Vánars, thouMust be our hope and leader now.\"He ceased: at King Sugríva callNear came a Vánar strong and tall.Huge as a towering mountain, loudAs some tremendous thunder cloud,A prince who warlike legions led:To him his sovereign turned and said:\"Go, take ten thousand(660) of our raceWell trained in lore of time and place,And search the eastern region; throughGroves, woods, and hills thy way pursue.There seek for Sítá, trace the spotWhere Rávan hides, and weary not.Search for the captive in the cavesOf mountains, and by woods and waves.To Sarjú,(661) Kausikí,(662) repair,Bhagírath daughter(663) fresh and fair.Search mighty Yamun(664) peak, exploreSwift Yamuná(665) delightful shore,Sarasvati(666) and Sindhu(667) tide,And rapid Sona(668) pebbly side.Then roam afar by Mahí(669) bedWhere Kálamahí groves are spread.Go where the silken tissue shines,Go to the land of silver mines.(670)Visit each isle and mountain steepAnd city circled by the deep,And distant villages that highAbout the peaks of Mandar lie.Speed over Yavadwipa land,(671)And see Mount Sisir(672) proudly standUplifting to the skies his headBy Gods and Dánavs visited.Search each ravine and mountain pass,Each tangled thicket deep in grass.Search every cave with utmost careIf haply Ráma queen be there.Then pass beyond the sounding seaWhere heavenly beings wander free,And Sona(673) waters swift and strongWith ruddy billows foam along.Search where his shelving banks descend,Search where the hanging woods extend.Try if the pathless thickets screenThe robber and the captive queen.Search where the torrent floods that rendThe mountain to the plains descend:Search dark abysses where they rave,Search mountain slope and wood and caveThen on with rapid feet and gainThe inlands of the fearful mainWhere, tortured by the tempest lash,Against rude rocks the billows dash:An ocean like a sable cloud,Whose margent monstrous serpents crowd:An ocean rising with a roarTo beat upon an iron shore.On, onward still!

The Army Of The North.Forth went the legions of the west:And wise Sugríva addressedSatabal, summoned from the crowd.To whom the sovereign cried aloud:\"Go forth, O Vánar chief, go forth,Explore the regions of the north.Thy host a hundred thousand be,And Yáma sons(733) attend on thee.With dauntless courage, strength, and skillSearch every river, wood, and hill.Through every land in order goRight onward to the Hills of Snow.Search mid the peaks that shine afar,In woods of Lodh and Deodár.(734)Search if with Janak daughter, screenedBy sheltering rocks, there lie the fiend.The holy grounds of Soma treadBy Gods and minstrels visited.Reach Kála mount, and flats that lieAmong the peaks that tower on high.Then leave that hill that gleams with ore,And fair Sudarsan heights explore.Then on to Devasakhá(735) hie,Loved by the children of the sky.A dreary land you then will seeWithout a hill or brook or tree,A hundred leagues, bare, wild, and dreadIn lifeless desolation, spread.Pursue your onward way, and hasteThrough the dire horrors of the wasteUntil triumphant with delightYou reach Kailása glittering height.There stands a palace decked with gold,For King Kuvera(736) wrought of old,A home the heavenly artist plannedAnd fashioned with his cunning hand.There lotuses adorn the floodWith full-blown flower and opening budWhere swans and mallards float, and gayApsarases(737) come down to play.There King Vaisravan(738) self, the lordBy all the universe adored,Who golden gifts to mortals sends,Lives with the Guhyakas(739) his friends.Search every cavern in the steep,And green glens where the moonbeams sleep,If haply in that distant groundThe robber and the dame be found.Then on to Krauncha hill,(740) and throughHis fearful pass your way pursue:Though dark and terrible the valeYour wonted courage must not fail.There through abyss and cavern seek,On lofty ridge, and mountain peak,On, on! pursue your journey stillBy valley, lake, and towering hill.Reach the North Kurus\\' land, where restThe holy spirits of the blest:Where golden buds of lilies gleamResplendent on the silver stream,And leaves of azure turkis throwSoft splendour on the waves below.Bright as the sun at early mornFair pools that happy clime adorn,Where shine the loveliest flowers on stemsOf crystal and all valued gems.Blue lotuses through all the landThe glories of their blooms expand,And the resplendent earth is strownWith peerless pearl and precious stone.There stately trees can scarce upholdThe burthen of their fruits of gold,And ever flaunt their gay attireOf flower and leaf like flames of fire.All there sweet lives untroubled spendIn bliss and joy that know not end,While pearl-decked maidens laugh, or singTo music of the silvery string.(741)Still on your forward journey keep,And rest you by the northern deep,Where springing from the billows highMount Somagiri(742) seeks the sky,And lightens with perpetual glowThe sunless realm that lies below.There, present through all life extent,Dwells Brahmá Lord preëminent,And round the great God, manifestIn Rudra(743) forms high sages rest.Then turn, O Vánars: search no more,Nor tempt the sunless, boundless shore.\"Canto XLIV. The Ring.But special counselling he gaveTo Hanumán the wise and brave:To him on whom his soul relied,With friendly words the monarch cried:\"O best of Vánars, naught can stayBy land or sea thy rapid way,Who through the air thy flight canst bend,And to the Immortals\\' home ascend.All realms, I ween, are known to theeWith every mountain, lake, and sea.In strength and speed which naught can tireThou, worthy rival of thy sireThe mighty monarch of the wind,Where\\'er thou wilt a way canst find.Exert thy power, O swift and strong,Bring back the lady lost so long,For time and place, O thou most wise,Lie open to thy searching eyes.\"When Ráma heard that special hestTo Hanumán above the rest,He from the monarch favour drewHope of success and trust anewThat he on whom his lord relied,In toil and peril trained and tried,Would to a happy issue bringThe task commanded by the king.He gave the ring that bore his name,A token for the captive dame,That the sad lady in her woeThe missive of her lord might know.\"This ring,\" he said, \"my wife will see,Nor fear an envoy sent by me.Thy valour and thy skill combined,Thy resolute and vigorous mind,And King Sugríva high behest,With joyful hopes inspire my breast.\"Canto XLV. The Departure.Away, away the Vánars spedLike locusts o\\'er the land outspread.To northern realms where rising highThe King of Mountains cleaves the sky,Fierce Satabal with vast arrayOf Vánar warriors led the way.Far southward, as his lord decreed,Wise Hanumán, the Wind-God seed,With Angad his swift way pursued,And Tára warlike multitude,Strong Vinata with all his bandBetook him to the eastern land,And brave Sushen in eager questSped swiftly to the gloomy west.Each Vánar chieftain sought with speedThe quarter by his king decreed,While from his legions rose on highThe shout and boast and battle cry:\"We will restore the dame and beatThe robber down beneath our feet.My arm alone shall win the dayFrom Rávan met in single fray,Shall rob the robber of his life,And rescue Ráma captive wifeAll trembling in her fear and woe.Here, comrades, rest: no farther go:For I will vanquish hell, and sheShall by this arm again be free.The rooted mountains will I rend,The mightiest trees will break and bend,Earth to her deep foundations cleave,And make the calm sea throb and heave.A hundred leagues from steep to steepIn desperate bound my feet shall leap.My steps shall tread unchecked and free,Through woods, o\\'er land and hill and sea,Range as they list from flood to fell,And wander through the depths of hell.\"Canto XLVI. Sugríva Tale.\"How, King,\" cried Ráma, \"didst thou gainThy lore of sea and hill and plain?\"\"I told thee how,\" Sugríva said,\"From Báli arm Máyáví fled(744)To Malaya hill, and strove to saveHis life by hiding in the cave.I told how Báli sought, to killHis foe, the hollow of the hill;Nor need I, King, again unfoldThe wondrous tale already told.Then, wandering forth, my way I tookBy many a town and wood and brook.I roamed the earth from place to place,Till, like a mirror polished face,The whole broad disk, that lies betweenIts farthest bounds, mine eyes had seen.I wandered first to eastern skiesWhere fairest trees rejoiced mine eyes,And many a cave and wooded hillWhere lilies robed the lake and rill.There metal dyes that hill(745) adornWhence springs the sun to light the morn.There, too, I viewed the Milky sea,Where nymphs of heaven delight to be.Then to the south I made my wayFrom regions of the rising day,And roamed o\\'er Vindhya, where the breezeIs odorous of sandal trees.Still in my fear I found no rest:I sought the regions of the west,And gazed on Asta,(746) where the sunSinks when his daily course is run.Then from that noblest hill I fledAnd to the northern country sped,Saw Himaván,(747) and Meru steep,And stood beside the northern deep.But when, by Báli might oppressed,E\\'en in those wilds I could not rest,Came Hanumán the wise and brave,And thus his prudent counsel gave:\"\\'I told thee how Matanga(748) cursedThy tyrant, that his head should burstIn pieces, should he dare invadeThe precincts of that tranquil shade.There may we dwell in peace and beFrom thy oppressor malice free.\"We went to Rishyamúka hill,And spent our days secure from illWhere, with that curse upon his head,The cruel Báli durst not tread.\"Canto XLVII. The Return.Thus forth in quest of Sítá wentThe legions King Sugríva sent.To many a distant town they hiedBy many a lake and river side.As their great sovereign order taught,Through valleys, plains, and groves they sought.They toiled unresting through the day:At night upon the ground they layWhere the tall trees, whose branches swayedBeneath their fruit, gave pleasant shade.Then, when a weary month was spent,Back to Prasravan hill they went,And stood with faces of despairBefore their king Sugríva there.Thus, having wandered through the east,Great Vinata his labours ceased,And weary of the fruitless painReturned to meet the king again,Brave Satabali to the northHad led his Vánar legions forth.Now to Sugríva he spedWith all his host dispirited.Sushen the western realms had sought,And homeward now his legions brought.All to Sugríva came, where stillHe sat with Ráma on the hill.Before their sovereign humbly bentAnd thus addressed him reverent:\"On every hill our steps have been,By wood and cave and deep ravine;And all the wandering brooks we knowThroughout the land that seaward flow,Our feet by thy command have tracedThe tangled thicket and the waste,And dens and dingles hard to passfor creeping plants and matted grass.Well have we searched with toil and pain,And monstrous creatures have we slainBut Hanumán of noblest mindThe Maithil lady yet will find;For to his quarter of the sky(749)The robber fiend was seen to fly.\"Canto XLVIII. The Asur Death.But Hanumán still onward pressedWith Tára, Angad, and the rest,Through Vindhya pathless glens he spedAnd left no spot unvisited.He gazed from every mountain height,He sought each cavern dark as night,And wandered through the bloomy shadeBy pool and river and cascade,But, though they sought in every place,Of Sítá yet they found no trace.On fruit and woodland berries fedThrough many a lonely wild they sped,And reached at last, untouched by fear,A desert terrible and drear:A fruitless waste, a land of gloomWhere trees were bare of leaf and bloom,Where every scanty stream was dried,And niggard earth her roots denied.No elephants through all the ground,No buffaloes or deer are found.There roams no tiger, pard, or bear,No creature of the wood is there.No bird displays his glittering wings,No tree, no shrub, no creeper springs.There rise no lilies from the flood,Resplendent with their flower and bud,Where the delighted bees may throngAbout the fragrance with their song.There lived a hermit Kandu named,For truth and wealth of penance famed.Whom fervent zeal and holy riteHad dowered with all-surpassing might.His little son, a ten year child--So chanced it--perished in the wild.His death with fury stirred the sage,Who cursed the forest in his rage,Doomed from that hour to shelter none,A waste for bird and beast to shun.They searched by every forest edge,They searched each cave and mountain ledge,And thickets whence the water fellWandering through the tangled dell.Striving to do Sugríva willThey roamed along each leafy rill.But vain were all endeavours, vainThe careful search, the toil and pain.Through one dark grove they scarce could wind,So thick were creepers intertwined.There as they struggled through the woodBefore their eyes an Asur(750) stood.High as a towering hill, his prideThe very Gods in heaven defied.When on the fiend their glances fellEach braced him for the combat well.The demon raised his arm on high,And rushed upon them with a cry.Him Angad smote,--for, sure, he thoughtThis was the fiend they long had sought.From his huge mouth by Angad felled,The blood in rushing torrents welled,As, like a mountain from his baseUptorn, he dropped upon his face.Thus fell the mighty fiend: and theyThrough the thick wood pursued their way;Then, weary with the toil, reclinedWhere leafy boughs to shade them twined.Canto XLIX. Angad Speech.Then Angad spake: \"We Vánars wellHave searched each valley, cave, and dell,And hill, and brook, and dark recess,And tangled wood, and wilderness.But all in vain: no eye has seenThe robber or the Maithil queen.A dreary time has passed away,And stern is he we all obey.Come, cast your grief and sloth aside:Again be every effort tried;So haply may our toil attainThe sweet success that follows pain.Laborious effort, toil, and skill,The firm resolve, the constant willSecure at last the ends we seek:Hence, O my friends, I boldly speak.Once more then, noble hearts, once moreLet us to-day this wood explore,And, languor and despair subdued,Purchase success with toil renewed.Sugríva is a king austere,And Ráma wrath we needs must fear.Come, Vánars, ye think it wise,And do the thing that I advise.\"Then Gandhamádan thus repliedWith lips that toil and thirst had dried;\"Obey his words, for wise and trueIs all that he has counselled you.Come, let your hosts their toil renewAnd search each grove and desert through,Each towering hill and forest glade.By lake and brook and white cascade,Till every spot, as our great lordCommanded, be again explored.\"Uprose the Vánars one and all,Obedient to the chieftain call,And over the southern region spedWhere Vindhya tangled forests spread.They clomb that hill that towers on highLike a huge cloud in autumn sky,Where many a cavern yawns, and streaksOf radiant silver deck the peaks.In eager search they wandered throughThe forests where the Lodh trees grew,Where the dark leaves were thick and green,But found not Ráma darling queen.Then faint with toil, their hearts depressed,Descending from the mountain crest,Their weary limbs a while to easeThey lay beneath the spreading trees.Canto L. The Enchanted Cave.Angad and Tára by his side,Again rose Hanumán and triedEach mountain cavern, dark and deep,And stony pass and wooded steep,The lion and the tiger home,By rushing torrents white with foam.Then with new ardour, south and west,O\\'er Vindhya height the search they pressed.The day prescribed was near and theyStill wandered on their weary way.They reached the southern land besetWith woody mountains like a net.At length a mighty cave they spiedThat opened in a mountain side.Where many a verdant creeper grewAnd o\\'er the mouth its tendrils threw.Thence issued crane, and swan, and drake,And trooping birds that love the lake.The Vánars rushed within to coolTheir fevered lips in spring or pool.Vast was the cavern dark and dread,Where not a ray of light was shed;Yet not the more their eyesight failed,Their courage sank or valour quailed.On through the gloom the Vánars pressedWith hunger, thirst, and toil distressed,Poor helpless wanderers, sad, forlorn,With wasted faces wan and worn.At length, when life seemed lost for aye,They saw a splendour as of day,A wondrous forest, fair and bright,Where golden trees shot flamy light.And lotus-covered pools were thereWith pleasant waters fresh and fair,And streams their rippling currents rolledBy seats of silver and of gold.Fair houses reared their stately heightOf burnished gold and lazulite,And glorious was the lustre thrownThrough lattices of precious stone.And there were flowers and fruit on stemsOf coral decked with rarest gems,And emerald leaves on silver trees,And honeycomb and golden bees.Then as the Vánars nearer drew,A holy woman met their view,Around her form was duly tiedA garment of the blackdeer hide.(751)Pure votaress she shone with lightOf fervent zeal and holy rite.Then Hanumán before the restWith reverent words the dame addressed:\"Who art thou? say: and who is lordOf this vast cave with treasures stored?\"Canto LI. Svayamprabhá.\"Assailed by thirst and hunger, dame,Within a gloomy vault we came.We saw the cavern opening wide,And straight within its depths we hied.But utterly amazed are weAt all the marvels that we see.Whose are the golden trees that gleamWith splendour like the morning beam?These cates of noblest sort? these roots?This wondrous store of rarest fruits?Whose are these calm and cool retreats,These silver homes and golden seats,And lattices of precious stones?Who is the happy lord that ownsThe golden trees, of rarest scent,Neath loads of fruit and blossom bent?Who, strong in holy zeal, had powerTo deck the streams with richest dower,And bade the lilies bright with goldThe glory of their blooms unfold,Where fish in living gold belowThe sheen of changing colours show?Thine is the holy power, I ween,That beautified the wondrous scene;But if another, lady, deignTo tell us, and the whole explain.\"To him the lady of the caveIn words like these her answer gave:\"Skilled Maya framed in days of oldThis magic wood of growing gold.The chief artificer in placeWas he of all the Dánav race.He, for his wise enchantments famed,This glorious dwelling planned and framedHe for a thousand years enduredThe sternest penance, and securedFrom Brahmá of all boons the best,The knowledge Usanas(752) possessed.Lord, by that boon, of all his will,He fashioned all with perfect skill;And, with his blissful state content,In this vast grove a season spent.By Indra jealous bolt he fellFor loving Hemá(753) charms too well.And Brahmá on that nymph bestowedThe treasures of this fair abode,Wherein her tranquil days to spendIn happiness that ne\\'er may end.Sprung of a lineage old and high,Merusávarni(754) daughter, IGuard ever for that heavenly dameThis home, Svayamprabhá(755) my name,--For I have loved the lady long,So skilled in arts of dance and song.But say what cause your steps has ledThe mazes of this grove to tread.How, strangers did ye chance to spyThe wood concealed from wanderer eye?Tell clearly why ye come: but firstEat of this fruit and quench your thirst.\"Canto LII. The Exit.\"Ráma,\" he cried, \"a prince whose swayAll peoples of the earth obey,To Dandak tangled forest cameWith his brave brother and his dame.From that dark shade of forest boughsThe giant Rávan stole his spouse.Our king Sugríva orders sendThese Vánars forth to aid his friend,That so the lady be restoredUninjured to her sorrowing lord.With Angad and the rest, this bandHas wandered through the southern land,With careful search in every placeThe lady and the fiend to trace.We roamed the southern region o\\'er,And stood upon the ocean shore.By hunger pressed our strength gave way;Beneath the spreading trees we lay,And cried, worn out with toil and woe,\"No farther, comrades, can we go.\"Then as our sad eyes looked aroundWe spied an opening in the ground,Where all was gloomy dark behindThe creeping plants that o\\'er it twined.Forth trooping from the dark-recessCame swans and mallards numberless,With drops upon their shining wingsAs newly bathed where water springs.\"On, comrades, to the cave,\" I criedAnd all within the portal hied.Each clasping fast another handFar onward pressed the Vánar band;And still, as thirst and hunger drove,We traced the mazes of the grove.Here thou with hospitable careHast fed us with the noblest fare,Preserving us, about to die,With this thy plentiful supply.But how, O pious lady, say,May we thy gracious boon repay?\"He ceased: the ascetic dame replied:\"Well, Vánars, am I satisfied.A life of holy works I lead,And from your hands no service need.\"Then spake again the Vánar chief:\"We came to thee and found relief.Now listen to a new distress,And aid us, holy votaress.Our wanderings in this vasty caveExhaust the time Sugríva gave.Once more then, lady, grant release,And let thy suppliants go in peaceAgain upon their errand sped,For King Sugríva ire we dread.And the great task our sovereign set,Alas, is unaccomplished yet.\"Thus Hanumán their leader prayed,And thus the dame her answer made:\"Scarce may the living find their wayReturning hence to light of day;But I will free you through the mightOf penance, fast, and holy rite.Close for a while your eyes, or ne\\'erMay you return to upper air.\"She ceased: the Vánars all obeyed;Their fingers on their eyes they laid,And, ere a moment time had fled,Were through the mazy cavern led.Again the gracious lady spoke,And joy in every bosom woke:\"Lo, here again is Vindhya hill,Whose valleys trees and creepers fill;And, by the margin of the sea,Prasravan where you fain would be.\"With blessings then she bade adieu,And swift within the cave withdrew.Canto LIII. Angad Counsel.They looked upon the boundless mainThe awful seat of Varun reign.And heard his waters roar and raveTerrific with each crested wave.Then, in the depths of sorrow drowned,They sat upon the bosky ground,And sadly, as they pondered, grievedFor days gone by and naught achieved.Pain pierced them through with sharper stingWhen, gazing on the trees of spring,They saw each waving bough that showedThe treasures of its glorious load,And helpless, fainting with the weightOf woe they sank disconsolate.Then, lion-shouldered, stout and strong,The noblest of the Vánar throng,Angad the prince imperial rose,And, deeply stricken by the woesThat his impetuous spirit broke,Thus gently to the chieftains spoke:\"Mark ye not, Vánars, that the dayOur monarch fixed has passed away?The month is lost in toil and pain,And now, my friends, what hopes remain?On you, in lore of counsel tried,Our king Sugríva most relied.Your hearts, with strong affection fraught,His weal in every labour sought,And the true valour of your bandWas blazoned wide in every land.Forth on the toilsome search you sped,By me--for so he willed it--led,To us, of every hope bereft,Death is the only refuge left.For none a happy life may seeWho fails to do our king decree.Come, let us all from food abstain,And perish thus, since hope is vain.Stern is our king and swift to ire,Imperious, proud, and fierce like fire,And ne\\'er will pardon us the crimeOf fruitless search and wasted time.Far better thus to end our lives,And leave our wealth, our homes and wives,Leave our dear little ones and all,Than by his vengeful hand to fall.Think not Sugríva wrath will spareMe Báli son, imperial heir:For Raghu royal son, not he,To this high place anointed me.Sugríva, long my bitter foe,With eager hand will strike the blow,And, mindful of the old offence,Will slay me now for negligence,Nor will my pitying friends have powerTo save me in the deadly hour.No--here, O chieftains, will I lieBy ocean marge, and fast and die.\"They heard the royal prince declareThe purpose of his fixt despair;And all, by common terror moved,His speech in these sad words approved:\"Sugríva heart is hard and stern,And Ráma thoughts for Sítá yearn.Our forfeit lives will surely payFor idle search and long delay,And our fierce king will bid us dieThe favour of his friend to buy.\"Then Tára softly spake to cheerThe Vánars\\' hearts oppressed by fear:\"Despair no more, your doubts dispel:Come in this ample cavern dwell.There may we live in blissful easeMid springs and fruit and bloomy trees,Secure from every foe assault,For magic framed the wondrous vault.Protected there we need not fearThough Ráma and our king come near;Nor dread e\\'en him who batters downThe portals of the foeman town.\"(756)Canto LIV. Hanumán Speech.But Hanumán, while Tára, bestOf splendid chiefs his thought expressed,Perceived that Báli princely sonA kingdom for himself had won.(757)His keen eye marked in him combinedThe warrior arm, the ruler mind,And every noble gift should graceThe happy sovereign of his race:Marked how he grew with ripening ageMore glorious and bold and sage,--Like the young moon that night by nightShines on with ever waxing light,--Brave as his royal father, wiseAs he who counsels in the skies:(758)Marked how, forwearied with the quest,He heeded not his liege hest,But Tára every word obeyedLike Indra still by Sukra(759) swayed.Then with his prudent speech he triedTo better thoughts the prince to guide,And by division skilful artThe Vánars and the youth to part:\"Illustrious Angad, thou in fightHast far surpassed thy father might,Most worthy, like thy sire of old,The empire of our race to hold.The Vánars\\' fickle people rangeFrom wish to wish and welcome change.Their wives and babes they will not leaveAnd to their new-made sovereign cleave.No art, no gifts will draw awayThe Vánars from Sugríva sway,Through hope of wealth, through fear of painStill faithful will they all remain.Thou fondly hopest in this caveThe vengeance of the foe to brave.But Lakshman arm a shower will sendOf deadly shafts those walls to rend.Like Indra bolts his shafts have powerTo cleave the mountain like a flower.O Angad, mark my counsel well:If in this cave thou choose to dwell,These Vánar hosts with one accordWill quit thee for their lawful lord,And turn again with thirsty eyesTo wife and babe and all they prize.Thou in the lonely cavern leftOf followers and friends bereft,Wilt be in all thy woe, alas,Weak as a blade of trembling grass:And Lakshman arrows, keen and fierceFrom his strong bow, thy heart will pierce.But if in lowly reverence meekSugríva court with us thou seek,He, as thy birth demands, will shareThe kingdom with the royal heir.Thy loving kinsman, true and wise,Looks on thee still with favouring eyes.Firm in his promise, pure is he,And ne\\'er will vex or injure thee.He loves thy mother, lives for herA faithful friend and worshipper.That mother love thou mayst not spurn:Her only child, return, return.\"Canto LV. Angad Reply.\"What truth or justice canst thou find,\"Cried Angad, \"in Sugríva mind?Where is his high and generous soul,His purity and self-control?How is he worthy of our trust,Righteous, and true, and wise, and just,Who, shrinking not from sin and shame,Durst take his living brother dame?Who, when, in stress of mortal strifeHis noble brother fought for life,Against the valiant warrior barredThe portal which he stood to guard?Can he be grateful--he who tookThe hand of Ráma, and forsookThat friend who saved him in his woes,To whom his life and fame he owes?Ah no! his heart is cold and mean,What bids him search for Ráma queen?Not honour law, not friendship debt,But angry Lakshman timely threat.No prudent heart will ever placeIts trust in one so false and base,Who heeds not friendship, kith or kin,Who scorns the law and cleaves to sin.But true or false, whate\\'er he be,One consequence I clearly see;Me, in my youth anointed heirAgainst his wish, he will not spare,But strike with eager hand the blowThat rids him of a household foe.Shall I of power and friends despoiled,In all my purpose crossed and foiled,--Shall I Kishkindhá seek, and wait,Like some poor helpless thing, my fate?The cruel wretch through lust of swayWill seize upon his hapless prey,And to a prison secret gloomThe remnant of my years will doom.\\'Tis better far to fast and dieThan hopeless bound in chains to lie,Your steps, O Vánars, homeward bendAnd leave me here my life to end.Better to die of hunger hereThan meet at home the fate I fear.Go, bow you at Sugríva feet,And in my name the monarch greet.Before the sons of Raghu bend,And give the greeting that I send.Greet kindly Rumá too, for sheA son affection claims from me,And gently calm with friendly careMy mother Tárá wild despair;Or when she hears her darling fateThe queen will die disconsolate.\"Thus Angad bade the chiefs adieu:Then on the ground his limbs he threwWhere sacred Darbha(760) grass was spread,And wept as every hope had fled.The moving words of Angad drewDown aged cheeks the piteous dew.And, as the chieftains\\' eyes grew dim,They swore to stay and die with him.On holy grass whose every bladeWas duly, pointing southward, laid,The Vánars sat them down and bentTheir faces to the orient,While \"Here, O comrades, let us dieWith Angad,\" was the general cry.Canto LVI. Sampáti.Then came the vultures\\' mighty kingWhere sat the Vánars sorrowing,--Sampáti,(761) best of birds that flyOn sounding pinions through the sky,Jatáyus\\' brother, famed of old,Most glorious and strong and bold.Upon the slope of Vindhya hillHe saw the Vánars calm and still.These words he uttered while the sightFilled his fierce spirit with delight:\"Behold how Fate with changeless lawsWithin his toils the sinner draws,And brings me, after long delay,A rich and noble feast to-day,These Vánars who are doomed to dieMy hungry maw to satisfy.\"He spoke no more: and Angad heardThe menace of the mighty bird;And thus, while anguish filled his breast,The noble Hanumán addressed:\"Vivasvat(762) son has sought this placeFor vengeance on the Vánar race.See, Yáma, wroth for Sítá sake,Is come our guilty lives to take.Our king decree is left undone,And naught achieved for Raghu son.In duty have we failed, and henceComes punishment for dire offence.Have we not heard the marvels wroughtBy King Jatáyus,(763) how he foughtWith Rávan might, and, nobly brave,Perished, the Maithil queen to save?There is no living creature, none,But loves to die for Raghu son,And in long toils and dangers weHave placed our lives in jeopardy.Blest is Jatáyus, he who gaveHis life the Maithil queen to save,And proved his love for Ráma wellWhen by the giant hand he fell.Now raised to bliss and high renownHe fears not fierce Sugríva frown.Alas, alas! what miseries springFrom that rash promise of the king!(764)His own sad death, and Ráma sentWith Lakshman forth to banishment:The Maithil lady borne away:Jatáyus slain in mortal fray:The fall of Báli when the dartOf Ráma quivered in his heart:And, after toil and pain and care,Our misery and deep despair.\"He ceased: the feathered monarch heard,His heart with ruth and wonder stirred:\"Whose is that voice,\" the vulture cried,\"That tells me how Jatáyus died,And shakes my inmost soul with woeFor a loved brother overthrow?After long days at length I hearThe glorious name of one so dear.Once more, O Vánar chieftains, tellHow King Jatáyus fought and fell.But first your aid, I pray you, lend,And from this peak will I descend.The sun has burnt my wings, and INo longer have the power to fly.\"Canto LVII. Angad Speech.Though grief and woe his utterance brokeThey trusted not the words he spoke;But, looking still for secret guile,Reflected in their hearts a while:\"If on our mangled limbs he feed,We gain the death ourselves decreed.\"Then rose the Vánar chiefs, and lentTheir arms to aid the bird descent;And Angad spake: \"There lived of yoreA noble Vánar king who boreThe name of Riksharajas, greatAnd brave and strong and fortunate.His sons were like their father: fameKnows Báli and Sugríva name.Praised in all lands, a glorious kingWas Báli, and from him I spring.Brave Ráma, Dasaratha heir,A glorious prince beyond compare,His sire and duty law obeyed,And sought the depths of Dandak\\' shadeSítá his well-beloved dame,And Lakshman, with the wanderer came.A giant watched his hour, and stoleThe sweet delight of Ráma soul.Jatáyus, Dasaratha friend,Swift succour to the dame would lend.Fierce Rávan from his car he felled,And for a time the prize withheld.But bleeding, weak with years, and tired,Beneath the demon blows expired,Due rites at Ráma hands obtained,And bliss that ne\\'er shall minish, gained.Then Ráma with Sugríva madeA covenant for mutual aid,And Báli, to the field defied,By conquering Ráma arrow died.Sugríva then, by Ráma grace,Was monarch of the Vánar race.By his command a mighty hostSeeks Ráma queen from coast to coast.Sent forth by him, in every spotWe looked for her, but find her not.Vain is the toil, as though by nightWe sought to find the Day-God light.In lands unknown at length we foundA spacious cavern under ground,Whose vaults that stretch beneath the hillWere formed by Maya magic skill.Through the dark maze our steps were bent,And wandering there a month we spent,And lost, in fruitless error, thusThe days our king allotted us.Thus we though faithful have transgressed,And failed to keep our lord behest.No chance of safety can we see,No lingering hope of life have we.Sugríva wrath and Ráma hatePress on our souls with grievous weight:And we, because \\'tis vain to fly,Resolve at length to fast and die.\"Canto LVIII. Tidings Of Sítá.The piteous tears his eye bedewedAs thus his speech the bird renewed;\"Alas my brother, slain in fightBy Rávan unresisted might!I, old and wingless, weak and worn,O\\'er his sad fate can only mourn.Fled is my youth: in life declineMy former strength no more is mine.Once on the day when Vritra(765) died,We brothers, in ambitious pride,Sought, mounting with adventurous flight,The Day-God garlanded with light.On, ever on we urged our wayWhere fields of ether round us lay,Till, by the fervent heat assailed,My brother pinions flagged and failed.I marked his sinking strength, and spreadMy stronger wings to screen his head,Till, all my feathers burnt away,On Vindhya hill I fell and lay.There in my lone and helpless stateI heard not of my brother fate.\"Thus King Sampáti spoke and sighed:And royal Angad thus replied:\"If, brother of Jatáyus, thouHast heard the tale I told but now,Obedient to mine earnest prayerThe dwelling of that fiend declare.O, say where cursed Rávan dwells,Whom folly to his death impels.\"He ceased. Again Sampáti spoke,And hope in every breast awoke:\"Though lost my wings, and strength decayed,Yet shall my words lend Ráma aid.I know the worlds where Vishnu trod,(766)I know the realm of Ocean God;How Asurs fought with heavenly foes,And Amrit from the churning rose.(767)A mighty task before me lies,To prosper Ráma enterprise,A task too hard for one whom lengthOf days has rifled of his strength.I saw the cruel Rávan bearA gentle lady through the air.Bright was her form, and fresh and young,And sparkling gems about her hung.\"O Ráma, Ráma!\" cried the dame,And shrieked in terror Lakshman name,As, struggling in the giant hold,She dropped her gauds of gems and gold.Like sun-light on a mountain shoneThe silken garments she had on,And glistened o\\'er his swarthy formAs lightning flashes through the storm.That giant Rávan, famed of old,Is brother of the Lord of Gold.(768)The southern ocean roars and swellsRound Lanká, where the robber dwellsIn his fair city nobly plannedAnd built by Visvakarmá(769) hand.Within his bower securely barred,With monsters round her for a guard,Still in her silken vesture cladLies Sítá, and her heart is sad.A hundred leagues your course must beBeyond this margin of the sea.Still to the south your way pursue,And there the giant Rávan view.Then up, O Vánars, and away!For by my heavenly lore I say,There will you see the lady face,And hither soon your steps retrace.In the first field of air are borneThe doves and birds that feed on corn.The second field supports the crowsAnd birds whose food on branches grows.Along the third in balanced flightSail the keen osprey and the kite.Swift through the fourth the falcon springsThe fifth the slower vulture wings.Up to the sixth the gay swans rise,Where royal Vainateya(770) flies.We too, O chiefs, of vulture race,Our line from Vinatá may trace,Condemned, because we wrought a deedOf shame, on flesh and blood to feed.But all Suparna(771) wondrous powersAnd length of keenest sight are ours,That we a hundred leagues awayThrough fields of air descry our prey.Now from this spot my gazing eyeCan Rávan and the dame descry.Devise some plan to overleapThis barrier of the briny deep.Find the Videhan lady there,And joyous to your home repair.Me too, O Vánars, to the sideOf Varun(772) home the ocean, guide,Where due libations shall be paidTo my great-hearted brother shade.\"Canto LIX. Sampáti Story.They heard his counsel to the close,Then swiftly to their feet they rose;And Jámbaván with joyous breastThe vulture king again addressed:\"Where, where is Sítá? who has seen,Who borne away the Maithil queen?Who would the lightning flight withstandby Lakshman hand?\"Again Sampáti spoke to cheerThe Vánars as they bent to hear:\"Now listen, and my words shall showWhat of the Maithil dame I know,And in what distant prison liesThe lady of the long dark eyes.Scorched by the fiery God of Day,High on this mighty hill I lay.A long and weary time had passed,And strength and life were failing fast.Yet, ere the breath had left my frame,My son, my dear Supársva, came.Each morn and eve he brought me food,And filial care my life renewed.But serpents still are swift to ire,Gandharvas slaves to soft desire,And we, imperial vultures, needA full supply our maws to feed.Once he turned at close of day,Stood by my side, but brought no prey.He looked upon my ravenous eye,Heard my complaint and made reply:\"Borne on swift wings ere day was lightI stood upon Mahendra(773) height,And, far below, the sea I viewedAnd birds in countless multitude.Before mine eyes a giant flewWhose monstrous form was dark of hueAnd struggling in his grasp was borneA lady radiant as the morn.Swift to the south his course he bent,And cleft the yielding element.The holy spirits of the airCame round me as I marvelled there,And cried as their bright legions met:\"O say, is Sítá living yet?\"Thus cried the saints and told the nameOf him who held the struggling dame.Then while mine eye with eager lookPursued the path the robber took,I marked the lady streaming hair,And heard her cry of wild despair.I saw her silken vesture rentAnd stripped of every ornament,Thus, O my father, fled the time:Forgive, I pray, the heedless crime.\"In vain the mournful tale I heardMy pitying heart to fury stirred,What could a helpless bird of air,Reft of his boasted pinions, dare?Yet can I aid with all that willAnd words can do, and friendly skill.\"Canto LX. Sampáti Story.Then from the flood Sampáti paidDue offerings to his brother shade.He bathed him when the rites were done,And spake again to Báli son:\"Now listen, Prince, while I relateHow first I learned the lady fate.Burnt by the sun resistless mightI fell and lay on Vindhya height.Seven nights in deadly swoon I passed,But struggling life returned at last.Around I bent my wondering view,But every spot was strange and new.I scanned the sea with eager ken,And rock and brook and lake and glen,I saw gay trees their branches wave,And creepers mantling o\\'er the cave.I heard the wild birds\\' joyous song,And waters as they foamed along,And knew the lovely hill must beMount Vindhya by the southern sea.Revered by heavenly beings, stoodNear where I lay, a sacred wood,Where great Nisakar dwelt of yoreAnd pains of awful penance bore.Eight thousand seasons winged their flightOver the toiling anchorite--Upon that hill my days were spent,--And then to heaven the hermit went.At last, with long and hard assay,Down from that height I made my way,And wandered through the mountain passRough with the spikes of Darbha grass.I with my misery worn, and faintWas eager to behold the saint:For often with Jatáyus IHad sought his home in days gone by.As nearer to the grove I drewThe breeze with cooling fragrance blew,And not a tree that was not fair,With richest flower and fruit was there.With anxious heart a while I stayedBeneath the trees\\' delightful shade,And soon the holy hermit, brightWith fervent penance, came in sight.Behind him bears and lions, tameAs those who know their feeder, came,And tigers, deer, and snakes pursuedHis steps, a wondrous multitude,And turned obeisant when the sageHad reached his shady hermitage.Then came Nisakar to my sideAnd looked with wondering eyes, and cried:\"I knew thee not, so dire a changeHas made thy form and feature strange.Where are thy glossy feathers? whereThe rapid wings that cleft the air?Two vulture brothers once I knew:Each form at will could they endue.They of the vulture race were kings,And flew with Mátarisva(774) wings.In human shape they loved to greetTheir hermit friend, and clasp his feet.The younger was Jatáyus, thouThe elder whom I gaze on now.Say, has disease or foeman hateReduced thee from thy high estate?\"Canto LXI. Sampáti Story.\"Ah me! o\\'erwhelmed with shame and weakWith wounds,\" I cried, \"I scarce can speak.My hapless brother once and IOur strength of flight resolved to try.And by our foolish pride impelledOur way through realms of ether held.We vowed before the saints who treadThe wilds about Kailása head,That we with following wings would chaseThe swift sun to his resting place.Up on our soaring pinions throughThe fields of cloudless air we flew.Beneath us far, and far away,Like chariot wheels bright cities lay,Whence in wild snatches rose the songOf women mid the gay-clad throng,With sounds of sweetest music blentAnd many a tinkling ornament.Then as our rapid wings we strainedThe pathway of the sun we gained.Beneath us all the earth was seenClad in her garb of tender green,And every river in her bedMeandered like a silver thread.We looked on Meru far belowAnd Vindhya and the Lord of Snow,Like elephants that bend to coolTheir fever in a lilied pool.But fervent heat and toil o\\'ercameThe vigour of each yielding frame,Our weary hearts began to quail,And wildered sense to reel and fail.We knew not, fainting and distressed,The north or south or east or west.With a great strain mine eyes I turnedWhere the fierce sun before me burned,And seemed to my astonished eyesThe equal of the earth in size.(775)At length, o\\'erpowered, Jatáyus fellWithout a word to say farewell,And when to earth I saw him hieI followed headlong from the sky.(776)With sheltering wings I intervenedAnd from the sun his body screened,But lost, for heedless folly doomed,My pinions which the heat consumed.In Janasthán, I hear them say,My hapless brother fell and lay.I, pinionless and faint and weak,Dropped upon Vindhya woody peak.Now with my swift wings burnt away,Reft of my brother and my sway,From this tall mountain summit IWill cast me headlong down and die.\"Canto LXII. Sampáti Story.\"As to the saint I thus complainedMy bitter tears fell unrestrained.He pondered for a while, then brokeThe silence, and thus calmly spoke:\"Forth from thy sides again shall spring,O royal bird, each withered wing,And all thine ancient power and mightReturn to thee with strength of sight.A noble deed has been foretoldIn prophecy pronounced of old:Nor dark to me are future things,Seen by the light which penance brings.A glorious king shall rise and reign,The pride of old Ikshváku strain.A good and valiant prince, his heir,Shall the dear name of Ráma bear.With his brave brother Lakshman heAn exile in the woods shall be,Where Rávan, whom no God may slay,(777)Shall steal his darling wife away.In vain the captive will be wooedWith proffered love and dainty food,She will not hear, she will not taste:But, lest her beauty wane and waste,Lord Indra self will come to herWith heavenly food, and minister.Then envoys of the Vánar raceBy Ráma sent will seek this place.To them, O roamer of the air,The lady fate shalt thou declare.Thou must not move--so maimed thou artThou canst not from this spot depart.Await the day and moment due,And thy burnt wings will sprout anew.I might this day the boon bestowAnd bid again thy pinions grow,But wait until thy saving deedThe nations from their fear have freed.Then for this glorious aid of thineThe princes of Ikshváku line,And Gods above and saints belowEternal gratitude shall owe.Fain would mine aged eyes beholdThat pair of whom my lips have told,Yet wearied here I must not stay,But leave my frame and pass away.\"Canto LXIII. Sampáti Story.\"With this and many a speech besideMy failing heart he fortified,With glorious hope my breast inspired,And to his holy home retired.I scaled the mountain height, to viewThe region round, and looked for you.In ceaseless watchings night and dayA hundred seasons passed away,And by the sage words consoledI wait the hour and chance foretold.But since Nisakar sought the skies.And cast away all earthly ties,Full many a care and doubt has pressedWith grievous weight upon my breast.But for the saint who turned asideMy purpose I had surely died.Those hopeful words the hermit spake,That bid me live for Ráma sake,Dispel my anguish as the lightOf lamp and torch disperse the night.\"He ceased: and in the Vánars\\' viewForth from his side young pinions grew,And boundless rapture filled his breastAs thus the chieftains he addressed:\"Joy, joy! the pinions, which the LordOf Day consumed, are now restoredThrough the dear grace & boundless mightOf that illustrious anchorite.The fire of youth within me burns,And all my wonted strength returns.Onward, ye Vánars, toil strive,And you shall find the dame alive.Look on these new-found wings, and henceBe strong in surest confidence.\"Swift from the crag he sprang to tryHis pinions in his native sky.His words the chieftains\\' doubts had stilled,And every heart with courage filled.(778)Canto LXIV. The Sea.Shouts of triumphant joy outrangAs to their feet the Vánars sprang:And, on the mighty task intent,Swift to the sea their steps they bent.They stood and gazed upon the deep,Whose billows with a roar and leapOn the sea banks ware wildly hurled,--The mirror of the mighty world.There on the strand the Vánars stayedAnd with sad eyes the deep surveyed,Here, as in play, his billows rose,And there he slumbered in repose.Here leapt the boisterous waters, highAs mountains, menacing the sky,And wild infernal forms betweenThe ridges of the waves were seen.They saw the billows rave and swell,And their sad spirits sank and fell;For ocean in their deep despairSeemed boundless as the fields of air.Then noble Angad spake to cheerThe Vánars and dispel their fear:\"Faint not: despair should never findAdmittance to a noble mind.Despair, a serpent mortal bite,Benumbs the hero power and might.\"Then passed the weary night, and allAssembled at their prince call,And every lord of high estateWas gathered round him for debate.Bright was the chieftains\\' glorious bandRound Angad on the ocean strand,As when the mighty Storm-Gods meetRound Indra on his golden seat.Then princely Angad looked on each,And thus began his prudent speech:\"What chief of all our host will leapA hundred leagues across the deep?Who, O illustrious Vánars, whoWill make Sugríva promise true,And from our weight of fear set freeThe leaders of our band and me?To whom, O warriors, shall we oweA sweet release from pain and woe,And proud success, and happy livesWith our dear children and our wives,Again permitted by his graceTo look with joy on Ráma face,And noble Lakshman, and our lordThe king, to our sweet homes restored?\"Thus to the gathered lords he spoke;But no reply the silence broke.Then with a sterner voice he cried:\"O chiefs, the nation boast and pride,Whom valour strength and power adorn,Of most illustrious lineage born,Where\\'er you will you force a way,And none your rapid course can stay.Now come, your several powers declare.And who this desperate leap will dare?\"Canto LXV. The Council.But none of all the host was foundTo clear the sea with desperate bound,Though each, as Angad bade, declaredHis proper power and what he dared.(779)Then spake good Jámbaván the sage,Chief of them all for reverend age;\"I, Vánar chieftains, long agoLimbs light to leap could likewise show,But now on frame and spirit weighsThe burthen of my length of days.Still task like this I may not slight,When Ráma and our king unite.So listen while I tell, O friends,What lingering strength mine age attends.If my poor leap may aught avail,Of ninety leagues, I will not fail.Far other strength in youth fresh primeI boasted, in the olden time,When, at Prahláda(780) solemn rite,I circled in my rapid flightLord Vishnu, everlasting God,When through the universe he trod.But now my limbs are weak and old,My youth is fled, its fire is cold,And these exhausted nerves to strainIn such a task were idle pain.\"Then Angad due obeisance paid,And to the chief his answer made:\"Then I, ye noble Vánars, IMyself the mighty leap will try:Although perchance the power I lackTo leap from Lanká island back.\"Thus the impetuous chieftain cried,And Jámbaván the sage replied:\"Whate\\'er thy power and might may be,This task, O Prince, is not for thee.Kings go not forth themselves, but sendThe servants who their best attend.Thou art the darling and the boast,The honoured lord of all the host.In thee the root, O Angad, liesOf our appointed enterprise;And thee, on whom our hopes depend,Our care must cherish and defend.\"Then Báli noble son replied:\"Needs must I go, whate\\'er betide,For, if no chief this exploit dare,What waits us all save blank despair,--Upon the ground again to lieIn hopeless misery, fast, and die?For not a hope of life I seeIf we neglect our king decree.\"Then spoke the aged chief again:\"Nay our attempt shall not be vain,For to the task will I inciteA chieftain of sufficient might.\"Canto LXVI. Hanumán.The chieftain turned his glances whereThe legions sat in mute despair;And then to Hanumán, the bestOf Vánar lords, these words addressed:\"Why still, and silent, and apart,O hero of the dauntless heart?Thou keepest treasured in thy mindThe laws that rule the Vánar kind,Strong as our king Sugríva, braveAs Ráma self to slay or save.Through every land thy praise is heard,Famous as that illustrious bird,Aríshtanemi son,(781) the kingOf every fowl that plies the wing.Oft have I seen the monarch sweepWith sounding pinions o\\'er the deep,And in his mighty talons bearHuge serpents struggling through the air.Thy arms, O hero, match in mightThe ample wings he spreads for flight;And thou with him mayest well compareIn power to do, in heart to dare.Why, rich in wisdom, power, and skill,O hero, art thou lingering still?An Apsaras(782) the fairest foundOf nymphs for heavenly charms renowned,Sweet Punjikasthalá, becameA noble Vánar wedded dame.Her heavenly title heard no more,Anjaná was the name she bore,When, cursed by Gods, from heaven she fellIn Vánar form on earth to dwell,New-born in mortal shape the childOf Kunjar monarch of the wild.In youthful beauty wondrous fair,A crown of flowers about her hair,In silken robes of richest dyeShe roamed the hills that kiss the sky.Once in her tinted garments dressedShe stood upon the mountain crest,The God of Wind beside her came,And breathed upon the lovely dame.And as he fanned her robe asideThe wondrous beauty that he eyedIn rounded lines of breast and limbAnd neck and shoulder ravished him;And captured by her peerless charmsHe strained her in his amorous arms.Then to the eager God she criedIn trembling accents, terrified:\"Whose impious love has wronged a spouseSo constant in her nuptial vows?\"He heard, and thus his answer made:\"O, be not troubled, nor afraid,But trust, and thou shalt know ere longMy love has done thee, sweet, no wrong,So strong and brave and wise shall beThe glorious child I give to thee.Might shall be his that naught can tire,And limbs to spring as springs his sire.\"Thus spoke the God; the conquered dameRejoiced in heart nor feared the shame.Down in a cave beneath the earthThe happy mother gave thee birth.Once o\\'er the summit of the woodBefore thine eyes the new sun stood.Thou sprangest up in haste to seizeWhat seemed the fruitage of the trees.Up leapt the child, a wondrous bound,Three hundred leagues above the ground,And, though the angered Day-God shotHis fierce beams on him, feared him not.Then from the hand of Indra cameA red bolt winged with wrath and flame.The child fell smitten on a rock,His cheek was shattered by the shock,Named Hanumán(783) thenceforth by allIn memory of the fearful fall.The wandering Wind-God saw thee lieWith bleeding cheek and drooping eye,And stirred to anger by thy woeForbade each scented breeze to blow.The breath of all the worlds was stilled,And the sad Gods with terror filledPrayed to the Wind, to calm the ireAnd soothe the sorrow of the sire.His fiery wrath no longer glowed,And Brahmá self the boon bestowedThat in the brunt of battle noneShould slay with steel the Wind-God son.Lord Indra, sovereign of the skies,Bent on thee all his thousand eyes,And swore that ne\\'er the bolt which heHurls from the heaven should injure thee.\\'Tis thine, O mighty chief, to shareThe Wind-God power, his son and heir.Sprung from that glorious father thou,And thou alone, canst aid us now.This earth of yore, through all her climes,I circled one-and-twenty times,And gathered, as the Gods decreed,Great store of herbs from hill and mead,Which, scattered o\\'er the troubled wave,The Amrit to the toilers gave.But now my days are wellnigh told,My strength is gone, my limbs are old,And thou, the bravest and the best,Art the sure hope of all the rest.Now, mighty chief, the task assay:Thy matchless power and strength display.Rise up, O prince, our second king,And o\\'er the flood of ocean spring.So shall the glorious exploit vieWith his who stepped through earth and sky.\"(784)He spoke: the younger chieftain heard,His soul to vigorous effort stirred,And stood before their joyous eyesDilated in gigantic size.Canto LXVII. Hanumán Speech.Soon as his stature they beheld,Their fear and sorrow were dispelled;And joyous praises loud and longRang out from all the Vánar throng.On the great chief their eyes they bentIn rapture and astonishment,As, when his conquering foot he raised,The Gods upon Náráyan(785) gazed.He stood amid the joyous crowd,Bent to the chiefs, and cried aloud:\"The Wind-God, Fire eternal friend,Whose blasts the mountain summits rend,With boundless force that none may stay,Takes where he lists his viewless way.Sprung from that glorious father, IIn power and speed with him may vie,A thousand times with airy leapCan circle loftiest Meru steep:With my fierce arms can stir the seaTill from their bed the waters fleeAnd rush at my command to drownThis land with grove and tower and town.I through the fields of air can springFar swifter than the feathered King,And leap before him as he flies,On sounding pinions through the skies.I can pursue the Lord of LightUprising from the eastern height,And reach him ere his course be spedWith burning beams engarlanded.I will dry up the mighty main,Shatter the rocks and rend the plain.O\\'er earth and ocean will I bound,And every flower that grows on ground,And bloom of climbing plants shall showStrewn on the ground, the way I go,Bright as the lustrous path that liesAthwart the region of the skies.(786)The Maithil lady will I find,--Thus speaks mine own prophetic mind,--And cast in hideous ruin downThe shattered walls of Lanká town.\"Still on the chief in rapt surpriseThe Vánar legions bent their eyes,And thus again sage JámbavánAddressed the glorious Hanumán:\"Son of the Wind, thy promise cheersThe Vánars\\' hearts, and calms their fears,Who, rescued from their dire distress,With prospering vows thy way will bless.The holy saints their favour lend,And all our chiefs the deed commendUrging thee forward on thy way:Arise then, and the task assay.Thou art our only refuge; we,Our lives and all, depend on thee.\"Then sprang the Wind-God son the bestOf Vánars, on Mahendra crest,And the great mountain rocked and swayedBy that unusual weight dismayed,As reels an elephant beneathThe lion spring and rending teeth.The shady wood that crowned him shook,The trembling birds the boughs forsook,And ape and pard and lion fledFrom brake and lair disquieted.',\n",
       " 'BOOK 5': 'Canto I. Hanumán Leap.Thus Rávan foe resolved to traceThe captive to her hiding-placeThrough airy pathways overheadWhich heavenly minstrels visited.With straining nerve and eager brows,Like some strong husband of the cows,In ready might he stood preparedFor the bold task his soul has dared.O\\'er gem-like grass that flashed and glowedThe Vánar like a lion strode.Roused by the thunder of his tread,The beasts to shady coverts fled.Tall trees he crushed or hurled aside,And every bird was terrified.Around him loveliest lilies grew,Pale pink, and red, and white, and blue,And tints of many a metal lentThe light of varied ornament.Gandharvas, changing forms at will,And Yakshas roamed the lovely hill,And countless Serpent-Gods were seenWhere flowers and grass were fresh and green.As some resplendent serpent takesHis pastime in the best of lakes,So on the mountain woody heightThe Vánar wandered with delight.Then, standing on the flowery sod,He paid his vows to saint and God.Svayambhu(788) and the Sun he prayed,And the swift Wind to lend him aid,And Indra, sovereign of the skies,To bless his hardy enterprise.Then once again the chief addressedThe Vánars from the mountain crest:\"Swift as a shaft from Ráma bowTo Rávan city will I go,And if she be not there will flyAnd seek the lady in the sky;Or, if in heaven she be not found,Will hither bring the giant bound.\"He ceased; and mustering his mightSprang downward from the mountain height,While, shattered by each mighty limb,The trees unrooted followed him.The shadow on the ocean castBy his vast form, as on he passed,Flew like a ship before the galeWhen the strong breeze has filled the sail,And where his course the Vánar heldThe sea beneath him raged and swelled.Then Gods and all the heavenly trainPoured flowerets down in gentle rain;Their voices glad Gandharvas raised,And saints in heaven the Vánar praised.Fain would the Sea his succour lendAnd Raghu noble son befriend.He, moved by zeal for Ráma sake,The hill Maináka(789) thus bespake:\"O strong Maináka, heaven decreeIn days of old appointed theeTo be the Asurs bar, and keepThe rebels in the lowest deep.Thou guardest those whom heaven has cursedLest from their prison-house they burst,And standest by the gates of hellTheir limitary sentinel.To thee is given the power to spreadOr spring above thy watery bed.Now, best of noble mountains, riseAnd do the thing that I advise.E\\'en now above thy buried crestFlies mighty Hanumán, the bestOf Vánars, moved for Ráma sakeA wonderous deed to undertake.Lift up thy head that he may stayAnd rest him on his weary way.\"He heard, and from his watery shroud,As bursts the sun from autumn cloud,Rose swifty, crowned with plant and tree,And stood above the foamy sea.(790)There with his lofty peaks upraisedBright as a hundred suns he blazed,And crest and crag of burnished goldFlashed on the flood that round him rolled.The Vánar thought the mountain roseA hostile bar to interpose,And, like a wind-swept cloud, o\\'erthrewThe glittering mountain as he flew.Then from the falling hill rang outA warning voice and joyful shout.Again he raised him high in airTo meet the flying Vánar there,And standing on his topmost peakIn human form began to speak:(791)\"Best of the Vánars\\' noblest line,A mighty task, O chief, is thine.Here for a while, I pray thee, lightAnd rest upon the breezy height.A prince of Raghu line was heWho gave his glory to the Sea,(792)Who now to Ráma envoy showsHigh honour for the debt he owes.He bade me lift my buried headUprising from my watery bed,And woo the Vánar chief to restA moment on my glittering crest.Refresh thy weary limbs, and eatMy mountain fruits for they are sweet.I too, O chieftain, know thee well;Three worlds thy famous virtues tell;And none, I ween, with thee may vieWho spring impetuous through the sky.To every guest, though mean and low.The wise respect and honour show;And how shall I neglect thee, howSlight the great guest so near me now?Son of the Wind, \\'tis thine to shareThe might of him who shakes the air;And,--for he loves his offspring,--heIs honoured when I honour thee.Of yore, when Krita age(793) was new,The little hills and mountains flewWhere\\'er they listed, borne on wingsMore rapid than the feathered king.(794)But mighty terror came on allThe Gods and saints who feared their fall.And Indra in his anger rentTheir pinions with the bolts he sent.When in his ruthless fury heLevelled his flashing bolt at me,The great-souled Wind inclined to save,And laid me neath the ocean wave.Thus by the favour of the sireI kept my cherished wings entire;And for this deed of kindness doneI honour thee his noble son.O come, thy weary limbs relieve,And honour due from me receive.\"\"I may not rest,\" the Vánar cried;\"I must not stay or turn aside.Yet pleased am I, thou noblest hill,And as the deed accept thy will.\"Thus as he spoke he lightly pressedWith his broad hand the mountain crest,Then bounded upward to the heightOf heaven, rejoicing in his might,And through the fields of boundless blue,The pathway of his father, flew.Gods, saints, and heavenly bards beheldThat flight that none had paralleled,Then to the Nágas\\' mother(795) cameAnd thus addressed the sun-bright dame:\"See, Hanumán with venturous leapWould spring across the mighty deep,--A Vánar prince, the Wind-God seed:Come, Surasá, his course impede.In Rákshas form thy shape disguise,Terrific, like a hill in size:Let thy red eyes with fury glow,And high as heaven thy body grow.With fearful tusks the chief defy,That we his power and strength may try.He will with guile thy hold elude,Or own thy might, by thee subdued.\"Pleased with the grateful honours paid,The godlike dame their words obeyed,Clad in a shape of terror sheSprang from the middle of the sea,And, with fierce accents that appalledAll creatures, to the Vánar called:\"Come, prince of Vánars, doomed to beMy food this day by heaven decree.Such boon from ages long agoTo Brahmá favouring will I owe.\"She ceased, and Hanumán replied,By shape and threat unterrified:\"Brave Ráma with his Maithil spouseLodged in the shade of Dandak boughs,Thence Rávan king of giants stoleSítá the joy of Ráma soul.By Ráma high behest to herI go a willing messenger;And never shouldst them hinder oneWho toils for Dasaratha son.First captive Sítá will I see,And him who sent and waits for me,Then come and to thy will submit,Yea, by my truth I promise it.\"\"Nay, hope not thus thy life to save;Not such the boon that Brahmá gave.Enter my mouth,\" was her reply,\"Then forward on thy journey hie!\"(796)\"Stretch, wider stretch thy jaws,\" exclaimedThe Vánar chief, to ire inflamed;And, as the Rákshas near him drew,Ten leagues in height his stature grew.Then straight, her threatening jaws between,A gulf of twenty leagues was seen.To fifty leagues he waxed, and stillHer mouth grew wider at her will.Then smaller than a thumb became,Shrunk by his power, the Vánar frame.(797)He leaped within, and turning roundSprang through the portal at a bound.Then hung in air a moment, whileHe thus addressed her with a smile:\"O Daksha child,(798) farewell at last!For I within thy mouth have passed.Thou hast the gift of Brahmá grace:I go, the Maithil queen to trace.\"Then, to her former shape restored,She thus addressed the Vánar lord:\"Then forward to the task, and maySuccess and joy attend thy way!Go, and the rescued lady bringIn triumph to her lord and king.\"Then hosts of spirits as they gazedThe daring of the Vánar praised.Through the broad fields of ether, fastGarud royal self, he passed,The region of the cloud and rain,Loved by the gay Gandharva train,Where mid the birds that came and wentShone Indra glorious bow unbent,And like a host of wandering starsFlashed the high Gods\\' celestial cars.Fierce Sinhiká(799) who joyed in illAnd changed her form to work her will,Descried him on his airy wayAnd marked the Vánar for her prey.\"This day at length,\" the demon cried,\"My hunger shall be satisfied,\"And at his passing shadow caughtDelighted with the cheering thought.The Vánar felt the power that stayedAnd held him as she grasped his shade,Like some tall ship upon the mainThat struggles with the wind in vain.Below, above, his eye he bentAnd scanned the sea and firmament.High from the briny deep uprearedThe monster hideous form appeared,\"Sugríva tale,\" he cried, \"is true:This is the demon dire to viewOf whom the Vánar monarch told,Whose grasp a passing shade can hold.\"Then, as a cloud in rain-time growsHis form, dilating, swelled and rose.Wide as the space from heaven to hellHer jaws she opened with a yell,And rushed upon her fancied preyWith cloud-like roar to seize and slay.The Vánar swift as thought compressedHis borrowed bulk of limb and chest,And stood with one quick bound insideThe monstrous mouth she opened wide.Hid like the moon when Ráhu drawsThe orb within his ravening jaws.Within that ample cavern pentThe demon form he tore and rent,And, from the mangled carcass freed,Came forth again with thought-like speed.(800)Thus with his skill the fiend he slew,Then to his wonted stature grew.The spirits saw the demon dieAnd hailed the Vánar from the sky:\"Well hast thou fought a wondrous fightNor spared the fiend terrific might,On, on! perform the blameless deed,And in thine every wish succeed.Ne\\'er can they fail in whom combineSuch valour, thought, and skill as thine.\"Pleased with their praises as they sang,Again through fields of air he sprang,And now, his travail wellnigh done,The distant shore was almost won.Before him on the margent stoodIn long dark line a waving wood,And the fair island, bright and greenWith flowers and trees, was clearly seen,And every babbling brook that gaveHer lord the sea a tribute wave.He lighted down on Lamba peakWhich tinted metals stain and streak,And looked where Lanká splendid townShone on the mountain like a crown.Canto II. Lanká.The glorious sight a while he viewed,Then to the town his way pursued.Around the Vánar as he wentBreathed from the wood delicious scent,And the soft grass beneath his feetWith gem-like flowers was bright and sweet.Still as the Vánar nearer drewMore clearly rose the town to view.The palm her fan-like leaves displayed,Priyálas(801) lent their pleasant shade,And mid the lower greenery farConspicuous rose the Kovidár.(802)A thousand trees mid flowers that glowedHung down their fruit delicious load,(803)And in their crests that rocked and swayedSweet birds delightful music made.And there were pleasant pools whereonThe glories of the lotus shone;And gleams of sparkling fountains, stirredBy many a joyous water-bird.Around, in lovely gardens grewBlooms sweet of scent and bright of hue,And Lanká, seat of Rávan sway,Before the wondering Vánar lay:With stately domes and turrets tall,Encircled by a golden wall,And moats whose waters were aglowWith lily blossoms bright below:For Sítá sake defended wellWith bolt and bar and sentinel,And Rákshases who roamed in bandsWith ready bows in eager hands.He saw the stately mansions riseLike pale-hued clouds in autumn skies;Where noble streets were broad and bright,And banners waved on every height.Her gates were glorious to beholdRich with the shine of burnished gold:A lovely city planned and deckedBy heaven creative architect,(804)Fairest of earthly cities meetTo be the Gods\\' celestial seat.The Vánar by the northern gateThus in his heart began debate\"Our mightiest host would strive in vainTo take this city on the main:A city that may well defyThe chosen warriors of the sky;A city never to be wonE\\'en by the arm of Raghu son.Here is no hope by guile to winThe hostile hearts of those within.\\'Twere vain to war, or bribe, or sowDissension mid the Vánar foe.But now my search must I pursueUntil the Maithil queen I view:And, when I find the captive dame,Make victory mine only aim.But, if I wear my present shape,How shall I enter and escapeThe Rákshas troops, their guards and spies,And sleepless watch of cruel eyes?The fiends of giant race who holdThis mighty town are strong and bold;And I must labour to eludeThe fiercely watchful multitude.I in a shape to mock their sightMust steal within the town by night,Blind with my art the demons\\' eyes,And thus achieve my enterprise.How may I see, myself unseenOf the fierce king, the captive queen,And meet her in some lonely place,With none beside her, face to face?\"When the bright sun had left the skiesThe Vánar dwarfed his mighty size,And, in the straitest bounds restrained,The bigness of a cat retained.(805)Then, when the moon soft light was spread,Within the city walls he sped.Canto III. The Guardian Goddess.There from the circling rampart heightHe gazed upon the wondrous sight;Broad gates with burnished gold displayed,And courts with turkises inlaid;With gleaming silver, gems, and rowsOf crystal stairs and porticoes.In semblance of a Rákshas dameThe city guardian Goddess came,--For she with glances sure and keenThe entrance of a foe had seen,--And thus with fury in her eyeAddressed him with an angry cry:\"Who art thou? what has led thee, say,Within these walls to find thy way?Thou mayst not enter here in spiteOf Rávan and his warriors\\' might.\"\"And who art thou?\" the Vánar cried,By form and frown unterrified,\"Why hast thou met me by the gate,And chid me thus infuriate?\"He ceased: and Lanká made reply:\"The guardian of the town am I,Who watch for ever to fulfilMy lord the Rákshas monarch will.But thou shalt fall this hour, and deepShall be thy never-ending sleep.\"Again he spake: \"In spite of theeThis golden city will I see.Her gates and towers, and all the prideOf street and square from side to side,And freely wander where I pleaseAmid her groves of flowering trees;On all her beauties sate mine eye.Then, as I came, will homeward hie.\"Swift with an angry roar she smoteWith her huge hand the Vánar throat.The smitten Vánar, rage-impelled,With fist upraised the monster felled:But quick repented, stirred with shameAnd pity for a vanquished dame,When with her senses troubled, weakWith terror, thus she strove to speak:\"O spare me thou whose arm is strong:O spare me, and forgive the wrong.The brave that law will ne\\'er transgressThat spares a woman helplessness.Hear, best of Vánars, brave and bold,What Brahmá self of yore foretold;\"Beware,\" he said, \"the fatal hourWhen thou shalt own a Vánar power.Then is the giants\\' day of fear,For terror and defeat are near.\"Now, Vánar chief, o\\'ercome by thee,I own the truth of heaven decree.For Sítá sake will ruin fallOn Rávan, and his town, and all.\"Canto IV. Within The City.The guardian goddess thus subdued,The Vánar chief his way pursued,And reached the broad imperial streetWhere fresh-blown flowers were bright and sweet.The city seemed a fairer skyWhere cloud-like houses rose on high,Whence the soft sound of tabors cameThrough many a latticed window frame,And ever and anon rang outThe merry laugh and joyous shout.From house to house the Vánar wentAnd marked each varied ornament,Where leaves and blossoms deftly strungAbout the crystal columns hung.Then soft and full and sweet and clearThe song of women charmed his ear,And, blending with their dulcet tones,Their anklets\\' chime and tinkling zones.He heard the Rákshas minstrel singThe praises of their matchless king;And softly through the evening airCame murmurings of text and prayer.Here moved a priest with tonsured head,And there an eager envoy sped,Mid crowds with hair in matted twineClothed in the skins of deer and kine,--Whose only arms, which none might blame,Were blades of grass and holy flame(806)There savage warriors roamed in bandsWith clubs and maces in their hands,Some dwarfish forms, some huge of size,With single ears and single eyes.Some shone in glittering mail arrayedWith bow and mace and flashing blade;Fiends of all shapes and every hue,Some fierce and foul, some fair to view.He saw the grisly legions waitIn strictest watch at Rávan gate,Whose palace on the mountain crestRose proudly towering o\\'er the rest,Fenced with high ramparts from the foe,And lotus-covered moats below.But Hanumán, unhindered, foundQuick passage through the guarded bound,Mid elephants of noblest breed,And gilded car and neighing steed.[I omit Canto V. which corresponds to chapter XI. in Gorresio edition.That scholar justly observes: \"The eleventh chapter, Description ofEvening, is certainly the work of the Rhapsodists and an interpolation oflater date. The chapter might be omitted without any injury to the actionof the poem, and besides the metre, style, conceits and images differ fromthe general tenour of the poem; and that continual repetition of the samesounds at the end of each hemistich which is not exactly rime, butassonance, reveals the artificial labour of a more recent age.\" Thefollowing sample will probably be enough.Fair shone the moon, as if to lendHis cheering light to guide a friend,And, circled by the starry host,Looked down upon the wild sea-coast.The Vánar cheiftain raised his eyes,And saw him sailing through the skiesLike a bright swan who joys to takeHis pastime on a silver lake;Fair moon that calms the mourner pain.Heaves up the waters of the main,And o\\'er the life beneath him throwsA tender light of soft repose,The charm that clings to Mandar hill,Gleams in the sea when winds are still,And decks the lilly opening flower,Showed in that moon her sweetest power.I am unable to show the difference of style in a translation.]Canto VI. The Court.The palace gates were guarded wellBy many a Rákshas sentinel,And far within, concealed from view,Were dames and female retinueFor charm of form and face renowned;Whose tinkling armlets made a sound,Clashed by the wearers in their glee,Like music of a distant sea.The hall beyond the palace gate,Rich with each badge of royal state,Where lines of noble courtiers stood,Showed like a lion-guarded wood.There the wild music rose and fellOf drum and tabor and of shell,Through chambers at each holy tideBy solemn worship sanctified.Through grove and garden, undismayed,From house to house the Vánar strayed,And still his wondering glances bentOn terrace, dome, and battlement:Then with a light and rapid treadPrahasta(807) home he visited,And Kumbhakarna(808) courtyard whereA cloudy pile rose high in air;And, wandering o\\'er the hill, exploredThe garden of each Rákshas lord.Each court and grove he wandered through,Then nigh to Rávan palace drew.She-demons watched it foul of face,Each armed with sword and spear and mace,And warrior fiends of every hue,A strange and fearful retinue.There elephants in many a row,The terror of the stricken foe.Huge Airávat,(809) deftly trainedIn battle-fields, stood ready chained.Fair litters on the ground were setAdorned with gems and golden net.Gay bloomy creepers clothed the walls;Green bowers were there and picture halls,And chambers made for soft delight.Broad banners waved on every height.And from the roof like Mandar hillThe peacock cry came loud and shrill.(810)Canto VII. Rávan Palace.He passed within the walls and gazedOn gems and gold that round him blazed,And many a latticed window brightWith turkis and with lazulite.Through porch and ante-rooms he passedEach richer, fairer than the last;And spacious halls where lances lay,And bows and shells, in fair array:A glorious house that matched in showAll Paradise displayed below.Upon the polished floor were spreadFresh buds and blossoms white and red,And women shone, a lovely crowd,As lightning flashes through a cloud:A palace splendid as the skyWhich moon and planets glorify:Like earth whose towering hills unfoldTheir zones and streaks of glittering gold;Where waving on the mountain browsThe tall trees bend their laden boughs,And every bough and tender sprayWith a bright load of bloom is gay,And every flower the breeze has bentFills all the region with its scent.Near the tall palace pale of hueShone lovely lakes where lilies blew,And lotuses with flower and budGleamed on the bosom of the flood.There shone with gems that flashed afarThe marvel of the Flower-named(811) car,Mid wondrous dwellings still confessedSupreme and nobler than the rest.Thereon with wondrous art designedWere turkis birds of varied kind.And many a sculptured serpent rolledHis twisted coil in burnished gold.And steeds were there of noblest formWith flying feet as fleet as storm:And elephants with deftest skillStood sculptured by a silver rill,Each bearing on his trunk a wreathOf lilies from the flood beneath.There Lakshmí,(812) beauty heavenly queen,Wrought by the artist skill, was seenBeside a flower-clad pool to standHolding a lotus in her hand.Canto VIII. The Enchanted Car.There gleamed the car with wealth untoldOf precious gems and burnished gold;Nor could the Wind-God son withdrawHis rapt gaze from the sight he saw,By Visvakarmá(813) self proclaimedThe noblest work his hand had framed.Uplifted in the air it glowedBright as the sun diurnal road.The eye might scan the wondrous frameAnd vainly seek one spot to blame,So fine was every part and fairWith gems inlaid with lavish care.No precious stones so rich adornThe cars wherein the Gods are borne,Prize of the all-resistless mightThat sprang from pain and penance rite,(814)Obedient to the master willIt moved o\\'er wood and towering hill,A glorious marvel well designedBy Visvakarmá artist mind,Adorned with every fair deviceThat decks the cars of Paradise.Swift moving as the master choseIt flew through air or sank or rose,(815)And in its fleetness left behindThe fury of the rushing wind:Meet mansion for the good and great,The holy, wise, and fortunate.Throughout the chariot vast extentWere chambers wide and excellent,All pure and lovely to the eyesAs moonlight shed from cloudless skies.Fierce goblins, rovers of the nightWho cleft the clouds with swiftest flightIn countless hosts that chariot drew,With earrings clashing as they flew.Canto IX. The Ladies\\' Bower.Where stately mansions rose around,A palace fairer still he found,Whose royal height and splendour showedWhere Rávan self, the king, abode.A chosen band with bow and swordGuarded the palace of their lord,Where Ráksha dames of noble raceAnd many a princess fair of faceWhom Rávan arm had torn awayFrom vanquished kings in slumber lay.There jewelled arches high o\\'erheadAn ever-changing lustre shedFrom ruby, pearl, and every gemOn golden pillars under them.Delicious came the tempered airThat breathed a heavenly summer there,Stealing through bloomy trees that boreEach pleasant fruit in endless store.No check was there from jealous guard,No door was fast, no portal barred;Only a sweet air breathed to meetThe stranger, as a host should greetA wanderer of his kith and kinAnd woo his weary steps within.He stood within a spacious hallWith fretted roof and painted wall,The giant Rávan boast and pride,Loved even as a lovely bride.\\'Twere long to tell each marvel there,The crystal floor, the jewelled stair,The gold, the silver, and the shineOf chrysolite and almandine.There breathed the fairest blooms of spring;There flashed the proud swan silver wing,The splendour of whose feathers brokeThrough fragrant wreaths of aloe smoke.\"\\'Tis Indra heaven,\" the Vánar cried,Gazing in joy from side to side;\"The home of all the Gods is this,The mansion of eternal bliss.\"There were the softest carpets spread,Delightful to the sight and tread,Where many a lovely woman layO\\'ercome by sleep, fatigued with play.The wine no longer cheered the feast,The sound of revelry had ceased.The tinkling feet no longer stirred,No chiming of a zone was heard.So when each bird has sought her nest,And swans are mute and wild bees rest,Sleep the fair lilies on the lakeTill the sun kiss shall bid them wake.Like the calm field of winter skyWhich stars unnumbered glorify,So shone and glowed the sumptuous roomWith living stars that chased the gloom.\"These are the stars,\" the chieftain cried,\"In autumn nights that earth-ward glide,In brighter forms to reappearAnd shine in matchless lustre here.\"With wondering eyes a while he viewedEach graceful form and attitude.One lady head was backward thrown,Bare was her arm and loose her zone.The garland that her brow had gracedHung closely round another waist.Here gleamed two little feet all bareOf anklets that had sparkled there,Here lay a queenly dame at restIn all her glorious garments dressed.There slept another whose small handHad loosened every tie and band,In careless grace another layWith gems and jewels cast away,Like a young creeper when the treadOf the wild elephant has spreadConfusion and destruction round,And cast it flowerless to the ground.Here lay a slumberer still as death,Save only that her balmy breathRaised ever and anon the laceThat floated o\\'er her sleeping face.There, sunk in sleep, an amorous maidHer sweet head on a mirror laid,Like a fair lily bending tillHer petals rest upon the rill.Another black-eyed damsel pressedHer lute upon her heaving breast,As though her loving arms were twinedRound him for whom her bosom pined.Another pretty sleeper roundA silver vase her arms had wound,That seemed, so fresh and fair and youngA wreath of flowers that o\\'er it hung.In sweet disorder lay a throngWeary of dance and play and song,Where heedless girls had sunk to restOne pillowed on another breast,Her tender cheek half seen beneathBed roses of the falling wreath,The while her long soft hair concealedThe beauties that her friend revealed.With limbs at random interlacedRound arm and leg and throat and waist,That wreath of women lay asleepLike blossoms in a careless heap.Canto X. Rávan Asleep.Apart a dais of crystal roseWith couches spread for soft repose,Adorned with gold and gems of priceMeet for the halls of Paradise.A canopy was o\\'er them spreadPale as the light the moon beams shed,And female figures,(816) deftly planned,The faces of the sleepers fanned,There on a splendid couch, asleepOn softest skins of deer and sheep.Dark as a cloud that dims the dayThe monarch of the giants lay,Perfumed with sandal precious scentAnd gay with golden ornament.His fiery eyes in slumber closed,In glittering robes the king reposedLike Mandar mighty hill asleepWith flowery trees that clothe his steep.Near and more near the VánarThe monarch of the fiends to view,And saw the giant stretched supineFatigued with play and drunk with wine.While, shaking all the monstrous frame,His breath like hissing serpents\\' came.With gold and glittering bracelets gayHis mighty arms extended layHuge as the towering shafts that bearThe flag of Indra high in air.Scars by Airávat tusk impressedShowed red upon his shaggy breast.And on his shoulders were displayedThe dints the thunder-bolt had made.(817)The spouses of the giant kingAround their lord were slumbering,And, gay with sparkling earrings, shoneFair as the moon to look upon.There by her husband side was seenMandodarí the favourite queen,The beauty of whose youthful faceBeamed a soft glory through the place.The Vánar marked the dame more fairThan all the royal ladies there,And thought, \"These rarest beauties speakThe matchless dame I come to seek.Peerless in grace and splendour, sheThe Maithil queen must surely be.\"Canto XI. The Banquet Hall.But soon the baseless thought was spurnedAnd longing hope again returned:\"No: Ráma wife is none of these,No careless dame that lives at ease.Her widowed heart has ceased to careFor dress and sleep and dainty fare.She near a lover ne\\'er would lieThough Indra wooed her from the sky.Her own, her only lord, whom noneCan match in heaven, is Raghu son.\"Then to the banquet hall intentOn strictest search his steps he bent.He passed within the door, and foundFair women sleeping on the ground,Where wearied with the song, perchance,The merry game, the wanton dance,Each girl with wine and sleep oppressedHad sunk her drooping head to rest.That spacious hall from side to sideWith noblest fare was well supplied,There quarters of the boar, and hereRoast of the buffalo and deer,There on gold plate, untouched as yetThe peacock and the hen were set.There deftly mixed with salt and curdWas meat of many a beast and bird,Of kid and porcupine and hare,And dainties of the sea and air.There wrought of gold, ablaze with shineOf precious stones, were cups of wine.Through court and bower and banquet hallThe Vánar passed and viewed them all;From end to end, in every spot,For Sítá searched, but found her not.Canto XII. The Search Renewed.Again the Vánar chief beganEach chamber, bower, and hall to scan.In vain: he found not her he sought,And pondered thus in bitter thought:\"Ah me the Maithil queen is slain:She, ever true and free from stain,The fiend entreaty has denied,And by his cruel hand has died.Or has she sunk, by terror killed,When first she saw the palace filledWith female monsters evil mienedWho wait upon the robber fiend?No battle fought, no might displayed,In vain this anxious search is made;Nor shall my steps, made slow by shame,Because I failed to find the dame,Back to our lord the king be bent,For he is swift to punishment.In every bower my feet have been,The dames of Rávan have I seen;But Ráma spouse I seek in vain,And all my toil is fruitless pain.How shall I meet the Vánar bandI left upon the ocean strand?How, when they bid me speak, proclaimThese tidings of defeat and shame?How shall I look on Angad eye?What words will Jámbaván reply?Yet dauntless hearts will never failTo win success though foes assail,And I this sorrow will subdueAnd search the palace through and through,Exploring with my cautious treadEach spot as yet unvisited.\"Again he turned him to exploreEach chamber, hall, and corridor,And arbour bright with scented bloom,And lodge and cell and picture-room.With eager eye and noiseless feetHe passed through many a cool retreatWhere women lay in slumber drowned;But Sítá still was nowhere found.Canto XIII. Despair And Hope.Then rapid as the lightning flameFrom Rávan halls the Vánar came.Each lingering hope was cold and dead,And thus within his heart he said:\"Alas, my fruitless search is done:Long have I toiled for Raghu son;And yet with all my care have seenNo traces of the ravished queen.It may be, while the giant throughThe lone air with his captive flew,The Maithil lady, tender-souled,Slipped struggling from the robber hold,And the wild sea is rolling nowO\\'er Sítá of the beauteous brow.Or did she perish of alarmWhen circled by the monster arm?Or crushed, unable to withstandThe pressure of that monstrous hand?Or when she spurned his suit with scorn,Her tender limbs were rent and torn.And she, her virtue unsubdued,Was slaughtered for the giant food.Shall I to Raghu son relateHis well-beloved consort fate,My crime the same if I revealThe mournful story or conceal?If with no happier tale to tellI seek our mountain citadel,How shall I face our lord the king,And meet his angry questioning?How shall I greet my friends, and brookThe muttered taunt, the scornful look?How to the son of Raghu goAnd kill him with my tale of woe?For sure the mournful tale I bearWill strike him dead with wild despair.And Lakshman ever fond and true,Will, undivided, perish too.Bharat will learn his brother fate,And die of grief disconsolate,And sad Satrughna with a cryOf anguish on his corpse will die.Our king Sugríva, ever foundTrue to each bond in honour bound,Will mourn the pledge he vainly gave,And die with him he could not save.Then Rumá his devoted wifeFor her dead lord will leave her life,And Tárá, widowed and forlorn,Will die in anguish, sorrow-worn.On Angad too the blow will fallKilling the hope and joy of all.The ruin of their prince and kingThe Vánars\\' souls with woe will wring.And each, overwhelmed with dark despair,Will beat his head and rend his hair.Each, graced and honoured long, will missHis careless life of easy bliss,In happy troops will play no moreOn breezy rock and shady shore,But with his darling wife and childWill seek the mountain top, and wildWith hopeless desolation, throwHimself, his wife, and babe, below.Ah no: unless the dame I findI ne\\'er will meet my Vánar kind.Here rather in some distant dellA lonely hermit will I dwell,Where roots and berries will supplyMy humble wants until I die;Or on the shore will raise a pyreAnd perish in the kindled fire.Or I will strictly fast untilWith slow decay my life I kill,And ravening dogs and birds of airThe limbs of Hanumán shall tear.Here will I die, but never bringDestruction on my race and king.But still unsearched one grove I seeWith many a bright Asoka tree.There will I enter in, and throughThe tangled shade my search renew.Be glory to the host on high,The Sun and Moon who light the sky,The Vasus(818) and the Maruts\\'(819) train,Ádityas(820) and the Asvins(821) twain.So may I win success, and bringThe lady back with triumphing.\"Canto XIV. The Asoka Grove.He cleared the barrier at a bound;He stood within the pleasant ground,And with delighted eyes surveyedThe climbing plants and varied shade,He saw unnumbered trees unfoldThe treasures of their pendent gold,As, searching for the Maithil queen,He strayed through alleys soft and green;And when a spray he bent or brokeSome little bird that slept awoke.Whene\\'er the breeze of morning blew,Where\\'er a startled peacock flew,The gaily coloured branches shedTheir flowery rain upon his headThat clung around the Vánar tillHe seemed a blossom-covered hill,(822)The earth, on whose fair bosom layThe flowers that fell from every spray,Was glorious as a lovely maidIn all her brightest robes arrayed,He saw the breath of morning shakeThe lilies on the rippling lakeWhose waves a pleasant lapping madeOn crystal steps with gems inlaid.Then roaming through the enchanted ground,A pleasant hill the Vánar found,And grottoes in the living stoneWith grass and flowery trees o\\'ergrown.Through rocks and boughs a brawling rillLeapt from the bosom of the hill,Like a proud beauty when she fliesFrom her love arms with angry eyes.He clomb a tree that near him grewAnd leafy shade around him threw.\"Hence,\" thought the Vánar, \"shall I seeThe Maithil dame, if here she be,These lovely trees, this cool retreatWill surely tempt her wandering feet.Here the sad queen will roam apart.And dream of Ráma in her heart.\"Canto XV. Sítá.Fair as Kailása white with snowHe saw a palace flash and glow,A crystal pavement gem-inlaid,And coral steps and colonnade,And glittering towers that kissed the skies,Whose dazzling splendour charmed his eyes.There pallid, with neglected dress,Watched close by fiend and giantess,Her sweet face thin with constant flowOf tears, with fasting and with woe;Pale as the young moon crescent whenThe first faint light returns to men:Dim as the flame when clouds of smokeThe latent glory hide and choke;Like Rohiní the queen of starsOppressed by the red planet Mars;From her dear friends and husband torn,Amid the cruel fiends, forlorn,Who fierce-eyed watch around her kept,A tender woman sat and wept.Her sobs, her sighs, her mournful mien,Her glorious eyes, proclaimed the queen.\"This, this is she,\" the Vánar cried,\"Fair as the moon and lotus-eyed,I saw the giant Rávan bearA captive through the fields of air.Such was the beauty of the dame;Her form, her lips, her eyes the same.This peerless queen whom I beholdIs Ráma wife with limbs of gold.Best of the sons of men is he,And worthy of her lord is she.\"Canto XVI. Hanumán Lament.Then, all his thoughts on Sítá bent,The Vánar chieftain made lament:\"The queen to Ráma soul endeared,By Lakshman pious heart revered,Lies here,--for none may strive with Fate,A captive, sad and desolate.The brothers\\' might full well she knows,And bravely bears the storm of woes,As swelling Gangá in the rainsThe rush of every flood sustains.Her lord, for her, fierce Báli slew,Virádha monstrous might o\\'erthrew,For her the fourteen thousand slainIn Janasthán bedewed the plain.And if for her Ikshváku sonDestroyed the world \\'twere nobly done.This, this is she, so far renowned,Who sprang from out the furrowed ground,(823)Child of the high-souled king whose swayThe men of Míthilá obey:The glorious lady wooed and wonBy Dasaratha noblest son;And now these sad eyes look on herMid hostile fiends a prisoner.From home and every bliss she fledBy wifely love and duty led,And heedless of a wanderer woes,A life in lonely forests chose.This, this is she so fair of mould.Whose limbs are bright as burnished gold.Whose voice was ever soft and mild,Who sweetly spoke and sweetly smiled.O, what is Ráma misery! howHe longs to see his darling now!Pining for one of her fond looksAs one athirst for water brooks.Absorbed in woe the lady seesNo Rákshas guard, no blooming trees.Her eyes are with her thoughts, and theyAre fixed on Ráma far away.\"Canto XVII. Sítá Guard.His pitying eyes with tears bedewed,The weeping queen again he viewed,And saw around the prisoner standHer demon guard, a fearful band.Some earless, some with ears that hungLow as their feet and loosely swung:Some fierce with single ears and eyes,Some dwarfish, some of monstrous size:Some with their dark necks long and thinWith hair upon the knotty skin:Some with wild locks, some bald and bare,Some covered o\\'er with bristly hair:Some tall and straight, some bowed and bentWith every foul disfigurement:All black and fierce with eyes of fire,Ruthless and stern and swift to ire:Some with the jackal jaw and nose,Some faced like boars and buffaloes:Some with the heads of goats and kine,Of elephants, and dogs, and swine:With lions\\' lips and horses\\' brows,They walked with feet of mules and cows:Swords, maces, clubs, and spears they boreIn hideous hands that reeked with gore,And, never sated, turned afreshTo bowls of wine and piles of flesh.Such were the awful guards who stoodRound Sítá in that lovely wood,While in her lonely sorrow sheWept sadly neath a spreading tree.He watched the spouse of Ráma thereRegardless of her tangled hair,Her jewels stripped from neck and limb,Decked only with her love of him.Canto XVIII. Rávan.While from his shelter in the boughsThe Vánar looked on Ráma spouseHe heard the gathered giants raiseThe solemn hymn of prayer and praise.--Priests skilled in rite and ritual, whoThe Vedas and their branches(824) knew.Then, as loud strains of music brokeHis sleep, the giant monarch woke.Swift to his heart the thought returnedOf the fair queen for whom he burned;Nor could the amorous fiend controlThe passion that absorbed his soul.In all his brightest garb arrayedHe hastened to that lovely shade,Where glowed each choicest flower and fruit,And the sweet birds were never mute,And tall deer bent their heads to drinkOn the fair streamlet grassy brink.Near that Asoka grove he drew,--A hundred dames his retinue.Like Indra with the thousand eyesGirt with the beauties of the skies.Some walked beside their lord to holdThe chouries, fans, and lamps of gold.And others purest water boreIn golden urns, and paced before.Some carried, piled on golden plates,Delicious food of dainty cates;Some wine in massive bowls whereonThe fairest gems resplendent shone.Some by the monarch side displayed,Wrought like a swan, a silken shade:Another beauty walked behind,The sceptre to her care assigned.Around the monarch gleamed the crowdAs lightnings flash about a cloud,And each made music as she wentWith zone and tinkling ornament.Attended thus in royal stateThe monarch reached the garden gate,While gold and silver torches, fedWith scented oil a soft light shed.(825)He, while the flame of fierce desireBurnt in his eyes like kindled fire,Seemed Love incarnate in his pride,His bow and arrows laid aside.(826)His robe, from spot and blemish freeLike Amrit foamy from the sea,(827)Hung down in many a loosened foldInwrought with flowers and bright with gold.The Vánar from his station viewed,Amazed, the wondrous multitude,Where, in the centre of that ringOf noblest women, stood the king,As stands the full moon fair to view,Girt by his starry retinue.Canto XIX. Sítá Fear.Then o\\'er the lady soul and frameA sudden fear and trembling came,When, glowing in his youthful pride,She saw the monarch by her side.Silent she sat, her eyes depressed,Her soft arms folded o\\'er her breast,And,--all she could,--her beauties screenedFrom the bold gazes of the fiend.There where the wild she-demons keptTheir watch around, she sighed and wept.Then, like a severed bough, she layProne on the bare earth in dismay.The while her thoughts on love fleet wingsFlew to her lord the best of kings.She fell upon the ground, and thereLay struggling with her wild despair,Sad as a lady born againTo misery and woe and pain,Now doomed to grief and low estate,Once noble fair and delicate:Like faded light of holy lore,Like Hope when all her dreams are o\\'er;Like ruined power and rank debased,Like majesty of kings disgraced:Like worship foiled by erring slips,The moon that labours in eclipse;A pool with all her lilies dead,An army when its king has fled:So sad and helpless wan and worn,She lay among the fiends forlorn.Canto XX. Rávan Wooing.With amorous look and soft addressThe fiend began his suit to press:\"Why wouldst thou, lady lotus-eyed,From my fond glance those beauties hide?Mine eager suit no more repel:But love me, for I love thee well.Dismiss, sweet dame, dismiss thy fear;No giant and no man is near.Ours is the right by force to seizeWhat dames soe\\'er our fancy please.(828)But I with rude hands will not touchA lady whom I love so much.Fear not, dear queen: no fear is nigh:Come, on thy lover love rely,Some little sign of favor show,Nor lie enamoured of thy woe.Those limbs upon that cold earth laid,Those tresses twined in single braid,(829)The fast and woe that wear thy frame,Beseem not thee, O beauteous dame.For thee the fairest wreaths were meant,The sandal and the aloe scent,Rich ornaments and pearls of price,And vesture meet for Paradise.With dainty cates shouldst thou be fed,And rest upon a sumptuous bed.And festive joys to thee belong,The music, and the dance and song.Rise, pearl of women, rise and deckWith gems and chains thine arms and neck.Shall not the dame I love be seenIn vesture worthy of a queen?Methinks when thy sweet form was madeHis hand the wise Creator stayed;For never more did he designA beauty meet to rival thine.Come, let us love while yet we may,For youth will fly and charms decay,Come cast thy grief and fear aside,And be my love, my chosen bride.The gems and jewels that my handHas reft from every plundered land,--To thee I give them all this day,And at thy feet my kingdom lay.The broad rich earth will I o\\'errun,And leave no town unconquered, none;Then of the whole an offering makeTo Janak,(830) dear, for thy sweet sake.In all the world no power I seeOf God or man can strive with me.Of old the Gods and Asurs setIn terrible array I met:Their scattered hosts to earth I beat,And trod their flags beneath my feet.Come, taste of bliss and drink thy fill,And rule the slave who serves thy will.Think not of wretched Ráma: heIs less than nothing now to thee.Stript of his glory, poor, dethroned,A wanderer by his friends disowned,On the cold earth he lays his head,Or is with toil and misery dead.And if perchance he lingers yet,His eyes on thee shall ne\\'er be set.Could he, that mighty monarch, whoWas named Hiranyakasipu,Could he who wore the garb of goldWin Glory back from Indra hold?(831)O lady of the lovely smile,Whose eyes the sternest heart beguile,In all thy radiant beauty dressedMy heart and soul thou ravishest.What though thy robe is soiled and worn,And no bright gems thy limbs adorn,Thou unadorned art dearer farThan all my loveliest consorts are.My royal home is bright and fair;A thousand beauties meet me there,But come, my glorious love, and beThe queen of all those dames and me.\"Canto XXI. Sítá Scorn.She thought upon her lord and sighed,And thus in gentle tones replied:\"Beseems thee not, O King, to wooA matron, to her husband true.Thus vainly one might hope by sinAnd evil deeds success to win.Shall I, so highly born, disgraceMy husband house, my royal race?Shall I, a true and loyal dame,Defile my soul with deed of shame?\"Then on the king her back she turned,And answered thus the prayer she spurned:\"Turn, Rávan, turn thee from thy sin;Seek virtue paths and walk therein.To others dames be honour shown;Protect them as thou wouldst thine own.Taught by thyself, from wrong abstainWhich, wrought on thee, thy heart would pain.(832)Beware: this lawless love of thineWill ruin thee and all thy line;And for thy sin, thy sin alone,Will Lanká perish overthrown.Dream not that wealth and power can swayMy heart from duty path to stray.Linked like the Day-God and his shine,I am my lord and he is mine.Repent thee of thine impious deed;To Ráma side his consort lead.Be wise; the hero friendship gain,Nor perish in his fury slain.Go, ask the God of Death to spare,Or red bolt flashing through the air,But look in vain for spell or charmTo stay my Ráma vengeful arm.Thou, when the hero bends his bow,Shalt hear the clang that heralds woe,Loud as the clash when clouds are rentAnd Indra bolt to earth is sent.Then shall his furious shafts be sped,Each like a snake with fiery head,And in their flight shall hiss and flameMarked with the mighty archer name.(833)Then in the fiery deluge allThy giants round their king shall fall.\"Canto XXII. Rávan Threat.Then anger swelled in Rávan breast,Who fiercely thus the dame addressed:\"\\'Tis ever thus: in vain we sueTo woman, and her favour woo.A lover humble words impelHer wayward spirit to rebel.The love of thee that fills my soulStill keeps my anger in control,As charioteers with bit and reinThe swerving of the steed restrain.The love that rules me bids me spareThy forfeit life, O thou most fair.For this, O Sítá, have I borneThe keen reproach, the bitter scorn,And the fond love thou boastest yetFor that poor wandering anchoret;Else had the words which thou hast saidBrought death upon thy guilty head.Two months, fair dame, I grant thee stillTo bend thee to thy lover will.If when that respite time is fledThou still refuse to share my bed,My cooks shall mince thy limbs with steelAnd serve thee for my morning meal.\"(834)The minstrel daughters of the skiesLooked on her woe with pitying eyes,And sun-bright children of the Gods(835)Consoled the queen with smiles and nods.She saw, and with her heart at ease,Addressed the fiend in words like these;\"Hast thou no friend to love thee, noneIn all this isle to bid thee shunThe ruin which thy crime will bringOn thee and thine, O impious King?Who in all worlds save thee could wooMe, Ráma consort pure and true,As though he tempted with his loveQueen Sachí(836) on her throne above?How canst thou hope, vile wretch, to flyThe vengeance that e\\'en now is nigh,When thou hast dared, untouched by shame,To press thy suit on Ráma dame?Where woods are thick and grass is highA lion and a hare may lie;My Ráma is the lion, thouArt the poor hare beneath the bough.Thou railest at the lord of men,But wilt not stand within his ken.What! is that eye unstricken yetWhose impious glance on me was set?Still moves that tongue that would not spareThe wife of Dasaratha heir?\"Then, hissing like a furious snake,The fiend again to Sítá spake:\"Deaf to all prayers and threats art thou,Devoted to thy senseless vow.No longer respite will I give,And thou this day shalt cease to live;For I, as sunlight kills the morn,Will slay thee for thy scathe and scorn.\"The Rákshas guard was summoned: allThe monstrous crew obeyed the call,And hastened to the king to takeThe orders which he fiercely spake:\"See that ye guard her well, and tame,Like some wild thing, the stubborn dame,Until her haughty soul be bentBy mingled threat and blandishment.\"(837)The monsters heard: away he strode,And passed within his queens\\' abode.Canto XXIII. The Demons\\' Threats.Then round the helpless Sítá drewWith fiery eyes the hideous crew,And thus assailed her, all and each,With insult, taunt, and threatening speech:\"What! can it be thou prizest notThis happy chance, this glorious lot,To be the chosen wife of oneSo strong and great, Pulastya son?Pulastya--thus have sages told--Is mid the Lords of Life(838) enrolled.Lord Brahmá mind-born son was he,Fourth of that glorious company.Visravas from Pulastya sprang,--Through all the worlds his glory rang.And of Visravas, large-eyed dame!Our king the mighty Rávan came.His happy consort thou mayst be:Scorn not the words we say to thee.\"One awful demon, fiery-eyed,Stood by the Maithil queen and cried:\\'Come and be his, if thou art wise,Who smote the sovereign of the skies,And made the thirty Gods and three,(839)O\\'ercome in furious battle, flee.Thy lover turns away with scornFrom wives whom grace and youth adorn.Thou art his chosen consort, thouShall be his pride and darling now.\"Another, Vikatá by name,In words like these addressed the dame:\"The king whose blows, in fury dealt,The Nágas(840) and Gandharvas(841) felt,In battle fiercest brunt subdued,Has stood by thee and humbly wooed.And wilt thou in thy folly missThe glory of a love like this?Scared by his eye the sun grows chill,The wanderer wind is hushed and still.The rains at his command descend,And trees with new-blown blossoms bend.His word the hosts of demons fear,And wilt thou, dame, refuse to hear?Be counselled; with his will comply,Or, lady, thou shalt surely die.\"Canto XXIV. Sítá Reply.Still with reproaches rough and rudeThose fiends the gentle queen pursued:\"What! can so fair a life displease,To dwell with him in joyous ease?Dwell in his bowers a happy queenIn silk and gold and jewels\\' sheen?Still must thy woman fancy clingTo Ráma and reject our king?Die in thy folly, or forgetThat wretched wandering anchoret.Come, Sítá, in luxurious bowersSpend with our lord thy happy hours;The mighty lord who makes his ownThe treasures of the worlds o\\'erthrown.\"Then, as a tear bedewed her eye,The hapless lady made reply:\"I loathe, with heart and soul detestThe shameful life your words suggest.Eat, if you will, this mortal frame:My soul rejects the sin and shame.A homeless wanderer though he be,In him my lord, my life I see,And, till my earthly days be done,Will cling to great Ikshváku son.\"Then with fierce eyes on Sítá setThey cried again with taunt and threat:Each licking with her fiery tongueThe lip that to her bosom hung,And menacing the lady lifeWith axe, or spear or murderous knife:\"Hear, Sítá, and our words obey,Or perish by our hands to-day.Thy love for Raghu son forsake,And Rávan for thy husband take,Or we will rend thy limbs apartAnd banquet on thy quivering heart.Now from her body strike the head,And tell the king the dame is dead.Then by our lord commandment sheA banquet for our band shall be.Come, let the wine be quickly broughtThat frees each heart from saddening thought.Then to the western gate repair,And we will dance and revel there.\"Canto XXV. Sítá Lament.On the bare earth the lady sank,And trembling from their presence shrankLike a strayed fawn, when night is dark,And hungry wolves around her bark.Then to a shady tree she crept,And thought upon her lord and wept.By fear and bitter woe oppressedShe bathed the beauties of her breastWith her hot tears\\' incessant flow,And found no respite from her woe.As shakes a plantain in the breezeShe shook, and fell on trembling knees;While at each demon furious lookHer cheek its native hue forsook.She lay and wept and made her moanIn sorrow saddest undertone,And, wild with grief, with fear appalled,On Ráma and his brother called:\"O dear Kausalyá,(842) hear me cry!Sweet Queen Sumitrá,(843) list my sigh!True is the saw the wise declare:Death comes not to relieve despair.\\'Tis vain for dame or man to pray;Death will not hear before his day;Since I, from Ráma sight debarred,And tortured by my cruel guard,Still live in hopeless woe to grieveAnd loathe the life I may not leave,Here, like a poor deserted thing,My limbs upon the ground I fling,And, like a bark beneath the blast,Shall sink oppressed with woes at last.Ah, blest are they, supremely blest,Whose eyes upon my lord may rest;Who mark his lion port, and hearHis gentle speech that charms the ear.Alas, what antenatal crime,What trespass of forgotten timeWeighs on my soul, and bids me bowBeneath this load of misery now?\"Canto XXVI. Sítá Lament.\"I Ráma wife, on that sad day,By Rávan arm was borne away,Seized, while I sat and feared no ill,By him who wears each form at will.A helpless captive, left forlornTo demons\\' threats and taunts and scorn,Here for my lord I weep and sigh,And worn with woe would gladly die.For what is life to me afarFrom Ráma of the mighty car?The robber in his fruitless sinWould hope his captive love to win.My meaner foot shall never touchThe demon whom I loathe so much.The senseless fool! he knows me not,Nor the proud soul his love would blot.Yea, limb from limb will I be rent,But never to his prayer consent;Be burnt and perish in the fire,But never meet his base desire.My lord was grateful, true and wise,And looked on woe with pitying eyes;But now, recoiling from the strifeHe pities not his captive wife.Alone in Janasthán he slewThe thousands of the Rákshas crew.His arm was strong, his heart was brave,Why comes he not to free and save?Why blame my lord in vain surmise?He knows not where his lady lies.O, if he knew, o\\'er land and seaHis feet were swift to set me free;This Lanká, girdled by the deep,Would fall consumed, a shapeless heap,And from each ruined home would riseA Rákshas widow groans and cries.\"Canto XXVII. Trijatá Dream.Their threats unfeared, their counsel spurned,The demons\\' breasts with fury burned.Some sought the giant king to bearThe tale of Sítá fixt despair.With threats and taunts renewed the restAround the weeping lady pressed.But Trijatá, of softer mould,A Rákshas matron wise and old,With pity for the captive moved,In words like these the fiends reproved:\"Me, me,\" she cried, \"eat me, but spareThe spouse of Dasaratha heir.Last night I dreamt a dream; and stillThe fear and awe my bosom chill;For in that dream I saw foreshownOur race by Ráma hand o\\'erthrown.I saw a chariot high in air,Of ivory exceeding fair.A hundred steeds that chariot drewAs swiftly through the clouds it flew,And, clothed in white, with wreaths that shone,The sons of Raghu rode thereon.I looked and saw this lady here,Clad in the purest white, appearHigh on the snow white hill whose feetThe angry waves of ocean beat.And she and Ráma met at lastLike light and sun when night is past.Again I saw them side by side.On Rávan car they seemed to ride,And with the princely Lakshman fleeTo northern realms beyond the sea.Then Rávan, shaved and shorn, besmearedWith oil from head to foot, appeared.He quaffed, he raved: his robes were red:Fierce was his eye, and bare his head.I saw him from his chariot thrust;I saw him rolling in the dust.A woman came and dragged awayThe stricken giant where he lay,And on a car which asses drewThe monarch of our race she threw.He rose erect, he danced and laughed,With thirsty lips the oil he quaffed,Then with wild eyes and streaming mouthSped on the chariot to the south.(844)Then, dropping oil from every limb,His sons the princes followed him,And Kumbhakarna,(845) shaved and shorn,Was southward on a camel borne.Then royal Lanká reeled and fellWith gate and tower and citadel.This ancient city, far-renowned:All life within her walls was drowned;And the wild waves of ocean rolledO\\'er Lanká and her streets of gold.Warned by these signs I bid you fly;Or by the hand of Ráma die,Whose vengeance will not spare the lifeOf one who vexed his faithful wife.Your bitter taunts and threats forgo:Comfort the lady in her woe,And humbly pray her to forgive;For so you may be spared and live.\"[I omit the 28th and 29th Cantos as an unmistakeable interpolation.Instead of advancing the story it goes back to Canto XVII, containing alamentation of Sítá after Rávan has left her, and describes the theauspicious signs sent to cheer her, the throbbing of her left eye, arm,and side. The Canto is found in the Bengal recension. Gorresio translatesit. and observes: \"I think that Chapter XXVIII.--The Auspicious Signs--is anaddition, a later interpolation by the Rhapsodists. It has no bond ofconnexion either with what precedes or follows it, and may be struck outnot only without injury to, but positively to the advantage of the poem.The metre in which this chapter is written differs from that which isgenerally adopted in the course of the poem.\"]Canto XXX. Hanumán Deliberation.The Vánar watched concealed: each wordOf Sítá and the fiends he heard,And in a maze of anxious thoughtHis quick-conceiving bosom wrought.\"At length my watchful eyes have seen,Pursued so long, the Maithil queen,Sought by our Vánar hosts in vainFrom east to west, from main to main.A cautious spy have I exploredThe palace of the Rákhshas lord,And thoroughly learned, concealed from sight,The giant monarch power and might.And now my task must be to cheerThe royal dame who sorrows here.For if I go, and soothe her not,A captive in this distant spot,She, when she finds no comfort nigh,Will sink beneath her woes and die.How shall my tale, if unconsoledI leave her, be to Ráma told?How shall I answer Raghu son,\"No message from my darling, none?\"The husband wrath, to fury fanned,Will scorch me lifeless where I stand,Or if I urge my lord the kingTo Lanká isle his hosts to bring,In vain will be his zeal, in vainThe toil, the danger, and the pain.Yea, this occasion must I seizeThat from her guard the lady frees,(846)To win her ear with soft addressAnd whisper hope in dire distress.Shall I, a puny Vánar, chooseThe Sanskrit men delight to use?If, as a man of Bráhman kind,I speak the tongue by rules refined,The lady, yielding to her fears,Will think \\'tis Rávan voice she hears.I must assume my only plan--The language of a common(847) man.Yet, if the lady sees me nigh,In terror she will start and cry;And all the demon band, alarmed,Will come with various weapons armed,With their wild shouts the grove will fill,And strive to take me, or to kill.And, at my death or capture, diesThe hope of Ráma enterprise.For none can leap, save only me,A hundred leagues across the sea.It is a sin in me, I own,To talk with Janak child alone.Yet greater is the sin if IBe silent, and the lady die.First I will utter Ráma name,And laud the hero gifts and fame.Perchance the name she holds so dearWill soothe the faithful lady fear.\"Canto XXXI. Hanumán Speech.Then in sweet accents low and mildThe Vánar spoke to Janak child:\"A noble king, by sin unstained,The mighty Dasaratha reigned.Lord of the warrior car and steed,The pride of old Ikshváku seed.A faithful friend, a blameless king,Protector of each living thing.A glorious monarch, strong to save,Blest with the bliss he freely gave.His son, the best of all who knowThe science of the bended bow,Was moon-bright Ráma, brave and strong,Who loved the right and loathed the wrong,Who ne\\'er from kingly duty swerved,Loved by the lands his might preserved.His feet the path of law pursued;His arm rebellious foes subdued.His sire command the prince obeyedAnd, banished, sought the forest shade,Where with his wife and brother heWandered a saintly devotee.There as he roamed the wilds he slewThe bravest of the Rákshas crew.The giant king the prince beguiled,And stole his consort, Janak child.Then Ráma roamed the country round,And a firm friend, Sugríva, found,Lord of the Vánar race, expelledFrom his own realm which Báli held,He conquered Báli and restoredThe kingdom to the rightful lord.Then by Sugríva high decreeThe Vánar legions searched for thee,Sampáti counsel bade me leapA hundred leagues across the deep.And now my happy eyes have seenAt last the long-sought Maithil queen.Such was the form, the eye, the graceOf her whom Ráma bade me trace.\"He ceased: her flowing locks she drewTo shield her from a stranger view;Then, trembling in her wild surprise,Raised to the tree her anxious eyes.Canto XXXII. Sítá Doubt.Her eyes the Maithil lady raisedAnd on the monkey speaker gazed.She looked, and trembling at the sightWept bitter tears in wild affright.She shrank a while with fear distraught,Then, nerved again, the lady thought:\"Is this a dream mine eyes have seen,This creature, by our laws unclean?O, may the Gods keep Ráma, still,And Lakshman, and my sire, from ill!It is no dream: I have not slept,But, trouble-worn, have watched and weptAfar from that dear lord of mineFor whom in ceaseless woe I pine,No art may soothe my wild distressOr lull me to forgetfulness.I see but him: my lips can frameNo syllable but Ráma name.Each sight I see, each sound I hear,Brings Ráma to mine eye or ear,The wish was in my heart, and henceThe sweet illusion mocked my sense.\\'Twas but a phantom of the mind,And yet the voice was soft and kind.Be glory to the Eternal Sire,(848)Be glory to the Lord of Fire,The mighty Teacher in the skies,(849)And Indra with his thousand eyes,And may they grant the truth to beE\\'en as the words that startled me.\"Canto XXXIII. The Colloquy.Down from the tree Hanumán cameAnd humbly stood before the dame.Then joining reverent palm to palmAddressed her thus with words of balm:\"Why should the tears of sorrow rise,Sweet lady, to those lovely eyes,As when the wind-swept river floodsTwo half expanded lotus buds?Who art thou, O most fair of face?Of Asur,(850) or celestial race?Did Nága mother give thee birth?For sure thou art no child of earth.Do Rudras(851) claim that heavenly form?Or the swift Gods(852) who ride the storm?Or art thou Rohiní(853) the blest,That star more lovely than the rest,--Reft from the Moon thou lovest wellAnd doomed a while on earth to dwell?Or canst thou, fairest wonder, beThe starry queen Arundhatí,(854)Fled in thy wrath or jealous prideFrom her dear lord Vasishtha side?Who is the husband, father, sonOr brother, O thou loveliest one,Gone from this world in heaven to dwell,For whom those eyes with weeping swell?Yet, by the tears those sweet eyes shed,Yet, by the earth that bears thy tread,(855)By calling on a monarch name,No Goddess but a royal dame.Art thou the queen, fair lady, say,Whom Rávan stole and bore away?Yea, by that agony of woe,That form unrivalled here below,That votive garb, thou art, I ween,King Janak child and Ráma queen.\"Hope at the name of Ráma woke,And thus the gentle lady spoke:\"I am that Sítá wooed and wonBy Dasaratha royal son,The noblest of Ikshváku line;And every earthly joy was mine.But Ráma left his royal homeIn Dandak tangled wilds to roam.Where with Sumitrá son and me,He lived a saintly devotee.The giant Rávan came with guileAnd bore me thence to Lanká isle.Some respite yet the fiend allows,Two months of life, to Ráma spouse.Two moons of hopeless woe remain,And then the captive will be slain.\"Canto XXXIV. Hanumán Speech.Thus spoke the dame in mournful mood,And Hanumán his speech renewed:\"O lady, by thy lord decreeI come a messenger to thee.Thy lord is safe with steadfast friends,And greeting to his queen he sends,And Lakshman, ever faithful bowsHis reverent head to Ráma spouse.\"Through all her frame the rapture ran,As thus again the dame began:\"Now verily the truth I knowOf the wise saw of long ago:\"Once only in a hundred yearsTrue joy to living man appears.\"He marked her rapture-beaming hue,And nearer to the lady drew,But at each onward step he tookSuspicious fear her spirit shook.\"Alas, Alas,\" she cried in fear.\"False is the tale I joyed to hear.\\'Tis Rávan, \\'tis the fiend, who triesTo mock me with a new disguise.If thou, to wring my woman heart,Hast changed thy shape by magic art,And wouldst a helpless dame beguile,The wicked deed is doubly vile.But no: that fiend thou canst not be:Such joy I had from seeing thee.But if my fancy does not err,And thou art Ráma messenger,The glories of my lord repeat:For to these ears such words are sweet.\"The Vánar knew the lady thought,(856)And gave the answer fondly sought:\"Bright as the sun that lights the skyDear as the Moon to every eye.He scatters blessings o\\'er the landLike bounties from Vaisravan(857) hand.Like Vishnu strong and unsubdued,Unmatched in might and fortitude.Wise, truthful as the Lord of Speech,With gentle words he welcomes each.Of noblest mould and form is he,Like love incarnate deity.He quells the fury of the foe,And strikes when justice prompts the blow.Safe in the shadow of his armThe world is kept from scathe and harm.Now soon shall Rávan rue his theft,And fall, of realm and life bereft.For Ráma wrathful hand shall wingHis shafts against the giant king.The day, O Maithil Queen, is nearWhen he and Lakshman will be here,And by their side Sugríva leadHis countless hosts of Vánar breed.Sugríva servant, I, by nameHanumán, by his order came.With desperate leap I crossed the seaTo Lanká isle in search of thee,No traitor, gentle dame, am I:Upon my word and faith rely.\"Canto XXXV. Hanumán Speech.With joyous heart she heard him tellOf the great lord she loved so well,And in sweet accents, soft and low,Spoke, half forgetful of her woe:\"How didst thou stand by Ráma side?How came my lord and thou allied?How met the people of the woodWith men on terms of brotherhood?Declare each grace and regal signThat decks the lords of Raghu line.Each circumstance and look relate:Tell Ráma form and speech, and gait.\"\"Thy fear and doubt,\" he cried, \"dispelled,Hear, lady, what mine eyes beheld.Hear the imperial signs that graceThe glory of Ikshváku race.With moon-bright face and lotus eyes,Most beautiful and good and wise,With sun-like glory round his head,Long-suffering as the earth we tread,He from all foes his realm defends.Yea, o\\'er the world his care extends.He follows right in all his ways,And ne\\'er from royal duty strays.He knows the lore that strengthens kings;His heart to truth and honour clings.Each grace and gift of form and mindAdorns that prince of human kind;And virtues like his own endueHis brother ever firm and true.O\\'er all the land they roamed distraught,And thee with vain endeavour sought,Until at length their wandering feetTrod wearily our wild retreat.Our banished king Sugríva spiedThe princes from the mountain side.By his command I sought the pairAnd led them to our monarch there.Thus Ráma and Sugríva met,And joined the bonds that knit them yet,When each besought the other aid,And friendship and alliance made.An arrow launched from Ráma bowLaid Báli dead, Sugríva foe.Then by commandment of our lordThe Vánar hosts each land explored.We reached the coast: I crossed the seaAnd found my way at length to thee.\"(858)Canto XXXVI. Ráma Ring.\"Receive,\" he cried, \"this precious ring,(859)Sure token from thy lord the king:The golden ring he wont to wear:See, Ráma name engraven there.\"Then, as she took the ring he showed,The tears that spring of rapture flowed.She seemed to touch the hand that sentThe dearly valued ornament,And with her heart again at ease,Replied in gentle words like these:\"O thou, whose soul no fears deter,Wise, brave, and faithful messenger!And hast thou dared, o\\'er wave and foam,To seek me in the giants\\' home?In thee, true messenger, I findThe noblest of thy woodland kind.Who couldst, unmoved by terror, brookOn Rávan, king of fiends, to look.Now may we commune here as friends,For he whom royal Ráma sendsMust needs be one in danger tried,A valiant, wise, and faithful guide.Say, is it well with Ráma still?Lives Lakshman yet untouched by ill?Then why should Ráma hand be slowTo free his consort from her woe?Why spare to burn, in search of me,The land encircled by the sea?Can Bharat send no army outWith banners, cars and battle shout?Cannot thy king Sugríva lendHis legions to assist his friend?\"His hands upon his head he laidAnd thus again his answer made:\"Not yet has Ráma learnt where liesHis lady of the lotus eyes,Or he like Indra from the skyTo Sachí(860) aid, to thee would fly.Soon will he hear the tale, and then,Roused to revenge, the lord of menWill to the giants\\' island leadFierce myriads of the woodland breed,Bridging his conquering way, and makeThe town a ruin for thy sake.Believe my words, sweet dame; I swearBy roots and fruit, my woodland fare,By Meru peak and Vindhva chain,And Mandar of the Milky Main,Soon shalt thou see thy lord, though nowHe waits upon Prasravan(861) brow,Come glorious as the breaking morn,Like Indra on Airávat(862) borne.For thee he looks with longing eyes;The wood his scanty food supplies.For thee his brow is pale and worn,For thee are meat and wine forsworn.Thine image in his heart he keeps,For thee by night he wakes and weeps.Or if perchance his eyes he closeAnd win brief respite from his woes,E\\'en then the name of Sítá slipsIn anguish from his murmuring lips.If lovely flowers or fruit he sees,Which women love, upon the trees,To thee, to thee his fancy flies.And \\'Sítá! O my love!\\' he cries.\"Canto XXXVII. Sítá Speech.\"Thou bringest me,\" she cried again,\"A mingled draught of bliss and pain:Bliss, that he wears me in his heart,Pain, that he wakes and weeps apart,O, see how Fate is king of all,Now lifts us high, now bids us fall,And leads a captive bound with cordThe meanest slave, the proudest lord,Thus even now Fate stern decreeHas struck with grief my lord and me.Say, how shall Ráma reach the shoreOf sorrow waves that rise and roar,A shipwrecked sailor, well nigh drownedIn the wild sea that foams around?When will he smite the demon down,Lay low in dust the giants\\' town,And, glorious from his foes\\' defeat,His wife, his long-lost Sítá, meet?Go, bid him speed to smite his foesBefore the year shall reach its close.Ten months are fled but two remain,Then Rávan captive must be slain.Oft has Vibhishan,(863) just and wise,Besought him to restore his prize.But deaf is Rávan senseless ear:His brother rede he will not hear.Vibhishan daughter(864) loves me well:From her I learnt the tale I tell.Avindhva(865) prudent, just, and old,The giant fall has oft foretold;But Fate impels him to despiseHis word on whom he most relies.In Ráma love I rest secure,For my fond heart is true and pure,And him, my noblest lord, I deemIn valour, power, and might supreme.\"As from her eyes the waters ran,The Vánar chief again began:\"Yea, Ráma, when he hears my tale,Will with our hosts these walls assail.Or I myself, O Queen, this dayWill bear thee from the fiend away,Will lift thee up, and take thee henceTo him thy refuge and defence;Will take thee in my arms, and fleeTo Ráma far beyond the sea;Will place thee on Prasravan hillWhere Raghu son is waiting still.\"\"How canst thou bear me hence?\" she cried,\"The way is long, the sea is wide.To bear my very weight would beA task too hard for one like thee.\"(866)Swift rose before her startled eyesThe Vánar in his native size,Like Mandar hill or Meru height,Encircled with a blaze of light.\"O come,\" he cried, \"thy fears dispel,Nor doubt that I will bear thee well.Come, in my strength and care confide,And sit in joy by Ráma side.\"Again she spake: \"I know thee now,Brave, resolute, and strong art thou;In glory like the Lord of FireWith storm-swift feet which naught may tireBut yet with thee I may not fly:For, borne so swiftly through the sky,Mine eyes would soon grow faint and dim,My dizzy brain would reel and swim,My yielding arms relax their hold,And I in terror uncontrolledShould fall into the raging seaWhere hungry sharks would feed on me.Nor can I touch, of free accord,The limbs of any save my lord.If, by the giant forced away,In his enfolding arms I lay,Not mine, O Vánar, was the blame;What could I do, a helpless dame?Go, to my lord my message bear,And bid him end my long despair.\"Canto XXXVIII. Sítá Gem.Again the Vánar chief replied,With her wise answer satisfied:\"Well hast thou said: thou canst not braveThe rushing wind, the roaring wave.Thy woman heart would sink with fearBefore the ocean shore were near.And for thy dread lest limb of thineShould for a while be touched by mine,The modest fear is worthy oneWhose cherished lord is Raghu son.Yet when I sought to bear thee henceI spoke the words of innocence,Impelled to set the captive freeBy friendship for thy lord and thee.But if with me thou wilt not tryThe passage of the windy sky,Give me a gem that I may show,Some token which thy lord may know.\"Again the Maithil lady spoke,While tears and sobs her utterance broke:\"The surest of all signs is this,To tell the tale of vanished bliss.Thus in my name to Ráma speak:\"Remember Chitrakúta peakAnd the green margin of the rill(867)That flows beside that pleasant hill,Where thou and I together strayedDelighting in the tangled shade.There on the grass I sat with theeAnd laid my head upon thy knee.There came a greedy crow and peckedThe meat I waited to protectAnd, heedless of the clods I threw,About my head in circles flew,Until by darling hunger pressedHe boldly pecked me on the breast.I ran to thee in rage and griefAnd prayed for vengeance on the thief.Then Ráma(868) from his slumber roseAnd smiled with pity at my woes.Upon my bleeding breast he sawThe scratches made by beak and claw.He laid an arrow on his bow,And launched it at the shameless crow.That shaft, with magic power endued,The bird, where\\'er he flew, pursued,Till back to Raghu son he fledAnd bent at Ráma feet his head.(869)Couldst thou for me with anger stirredLaunch that dire shaft upon a bird,And yet canst pardon him who stoleThe darling of thy heart and soul?Rise up, O bravest of the brave,And come in all thy might to save.Come with the thunders of thy bow,And smite to earth the Rákshas foe.\"She ceased; and from her glorious hairShe took a gem that sparkled thereA token which her husband eyesWith eager love would recognize.His head the Vánar envoy bentIn low obeisance reverent.And on his finger bound the gemShe loosened from her diadem.[I omit two Cantos of dialogue. Sítá tells Hanumán again to convey hermessage to Ráma and bid him hasten to rescue her. Hanumán replies asbefore that there is no one on earth equal to Ráma, who will soon come anddestroy Rávan. There is not a new idea in the two Cantos: all isreiteration.]Canto XLI. The Ruin Of The Grove.Dismissed with every honour dueThe Vánar from the spot withdrew.Then joyous thought the Wind-God son:\"The mighty task is wellnigh done.The three expedients I must leave;The fourth alone can I achieve.(870)These dwellers in the giants\\' isleNo arts of mine can reconcile.I cannot bribe: I cannot sowDissension mid the Rákshas foe.Arts, gifts, address, these fiends despise;But force shall yet their king chastise.Perchance he may relent when allThe bravest of his chieftains fall.This lovely grove will I destroy,The cruel Rávan pride and joy.The garden where he takes his easeMid climbing plants and flowery treesThat lift their proud tops to the skies,Dear to the tyrant as his eyes.Then will he rouse in wrath, and leadHis legions with the car and steedAnd elephants in long array,And seek me thirsty for the fray.The Rákshas legions will I meet,And all his bravest host defeat;Then, glorious from the bloody plain,Turn to my lord the king again.\"Then every lovely tree that boreFair blossoms, from the soil he tore,Till each green bough that lent its shadeTo singing birds on earth was laid.The wilderness he left a waste,The fountains shattered and defaced:O\\'erthrew and levelled with the groundEach shady seat and pleasure-mound.Each arbour clad with climbing bloom,Each grotto, cell, and picture room,Each lawn by beast and bird enjoyed,Each walk and terrace was destroyed.And all the place that was so fairWas left a ruin wild and bare,As if the fury of the blastOr raging fire had o\\'er it passed.Canto XLII. The Giants Roused.The cries of startled birds, the soundOf tall trees crashing to the ground,Struck with amaze each giant ear,And filled the isle with sudden fear.Then, wakened by the crash and cries,The fierce shefiends unclosed their eyes,And saw the Vánar where he stoodAmid the devastated wood.The more to scare them with the viewTo size immense the Vánar grew;And straight the Rákshas warders criedJanak daughter terrified\"Whose envoy, whence, and who is he,Why has he come to talk with thee?Speak, lady of the lovely eyes,And let not fear thy joy disguise.\"Then thus replied the Maithil dameOf noble soul and perfect frame.\"Can I discern, with scanty skill,These fiends who change their forms at will?\\'Tis yours to say: your kin you meet;A serpent knows a serpent feet.I weet not who he is: the sightHas filled my spirit with affright.\"Some pressed round Sítá in a ring;Some bore the story to their king:\"A mighty creature of our race,In monkey form, has reached the place.He came within the grove,\" they cried,\"He stood and talked by Sítá side,He comes from Indra court to her,Or is Kuvera messenger;Or Ráma sent the spy to seekHis consort, and her wrongs to wreak.His crushing arm, his trampling feetHave marred and spoiled that dear retreat,And all the pleasant place which thouSo lovest is a ruin now.The tree where Sítá sat aloneIs spared where all are overthrown.Perchance he saved the dame from harm:Perchance the toil had numbed his arm.\"Then flashed the giant eye with fireLike that which lights the funeral pyre.He bade his bravest Kinkars(871) speedAnd to his feet the spoiler lead.Forth from the palace, at his hest,Twice forty thousand warriors pressed.Burning for battle, strong and fierce,With clubs to crush and swords to pierce,They saw Hanúmán near a porch,And, thick as moths around a torch,Rushed on the foe with wild attacksOf mace and club and battle-axe.As round him pressed the Rákshas crowd,The wondrous monkey roared aloud,That birds fell headlong from the sky:Then spake he with a mighty cry:\"Long life to Dasaratha heir,And Lakshman, ever-glorious pair!Long life to him who rules our race,Preserved by noblest Ráma grace!I am the slave of Kosal king,(872)Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing.Hanúmán I, the Wind-God seed:Beneath this arm the foemen bleed.I fear not, unapproached in might,A thousand Rávan ranged for fight,Although in furious hands they rearThe hill and tree for sword and spear,I will, before the giants\\' eyes,Their city and their king chastise;And, having communed with the dame,Depart in triumph as I came.\"At that terrific roar and yellThe heart of every giant fell.But still their king command they fearedAnd pressed around with arms upreared.Beside the porch a club was laid:The Vánar caught it up, and swayedThe weapon round his head, and slewThe foremost of the Rákshas crew.Thus Indra vanquished, thousand-eyed,The Daityas who the Gods defied.Then on the porch Hanúmán sprang,And loud his shout of triumph rang.The giants looked upon the dead,And turning to their monarch fled.And Rávan with his spirit wroughtTo frenzy by the tale they brought,Urged to the fight Prahasta son,Of all his chiefs the mightiest one.Canto XLIII. The Ruin Of The Temple.The Wind-God son a temple(873) scaledWhich, by his fury unassailed,High as the hill of Meru, stoodAmid the ruins of the wood;And in his fury thundered outAgain his haughty battle-shout:\"I am the slave of Kosal KingWhose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing.\"Forth hurried, by that shout alarmed,The warders of the temple armedWith every weapon haste supplied,And closed him in on every side,With bands that strove to pierce and strikeWith shaft and axe and club and pike.Then from its base the Vánar toreA pillar with the weight it bore.Against the wall the mass he dashed,And forth the flames in answer flashed,That wildly ran o\\'er roofs and wallIn hungry rage consuming all.He whirled the pillar round his headAnd struck a hundred giants dead.Then high upheld on air he roseAnd called in thunder to his foes:\"A thousand Vánar chiefs like meRoam at their will o\\'er land and sea,Terrific might we all possess:Our stormy speed is limitless.And all, unconquered in the fray,Our king Sugríva word obey.Backed by his bravest myriads, heOur warrior lord will cross the sea.Then Lanká lofty towers, and allYour hosts and Rávan self shall fall.None shall be left unslaughtered; noneWho braves the wrath of Raghu son.\"Canto XLIV. Jambumáli Death.Then Jambumáli, pride and boastFor valour of the Rákshas host,Prahasta son supremely brave,Obeyed the hest that Rávan gave:Fierce warrior with terrific teeth,With saguine robes and brilliant wreath.A bow like Indra own(874), and storeOf glittering shafts the chieftain bore.And ever as the string he triedThe weapon with a roar replied,Loud as the crashing thunder sentBy him who rules the firmament.Soon as the foeman came in viewBorne on a car which asses drew,The Vánar chieftain mighty-voicedShouted in triumph and rejoiced.Prahasta son his bow-string drew,And swift the winged arrows flew,One in the face the Vánar smote,Another quivered in his throat.Ten from the deadly weapon sentHis brawny arms and shoulders rent.Then as he felt each galling shotThe Vánar rage waxed fiercely hot.He looked, and saw a mass of stoneThat lay before his feet o\\'erthrown.The mighty block he raised and threw,And crashing through the air it flew.But Jambumáli shunned the blow,And rained fresh arrows from his bow.The Vánar limbs were red with gore:A Sál tree from the earth he tore,And, ere he hurled it undismayed,Above his head the missile swayed.But shafts from Jambumáli bowCut through it ere his hand could throw.And thigh and arm and chest and sideWith streams of rushing blood were dyed.Still unsubdued though wounded oftThe shattered trunk he raised aloft,And down with well-directed aimOn Jambumáli chest it came.There crushed upon the trampled grassHe lay an undistinguished mass,The foeman eye no more could seeHis head or chest or arm or knee.And bow and car and steeds(875) and storeOf glittering shafts were seen no more.When Jambumáli death he heard,King Rávan heart with rage was stirredAnd forth his general sons he sent,For power and might preeminent.Canto XLV. The Seven Defeated.Forth went the seven in brave attire,In glory brilliant as the fire,Impetuous chiefs with massive bows,The quellers of a host of foes:Trained from their youth in martial lore,And masters of the arms they bore:Each emulous and fiercely bold,And banners wrought with glittering goldWaved o\\'er their chariots, drawn at speedBy coursers of the noblest breed.On through the ruins of the groveAt Hanumán they fiercely drove,And from the ponderous bows they strainedA shower of deadly arrows rained.Then scarce was seen the Vánar formEnveloped in the arrowy storm.So stands half veiled the Mountains\\' KingWhen rainy clouds about him cling.By nimble turn, by rapid boundHe shunned the shafts that rained around,Eluding, as in air he rose,The rushing chariots of his foes.The mighty Vánar undismayedAmid his archer foemen played,As plays the frolic wind on highMid bow-armed(876) clouds that fill the sky.He raised a mighty roar and yellThat fear on all the army fell,And then, his warrior soul aglowWith fury, rushed upon the foe,Some with his open hand he beatTo death and trampled with his feet;Some with fierce nails he rent and slew,And others with his fists o\\'erthrew;Some with his legs, as on he rushed,Some with his bulky chest he crushed;While some struck senseless by his roarDropped on the ground and breathed no more,The remnant, seized with sudden dread,Turned from the grove and wildly fled.The trampled earth was thickly strownWith steed and car and flag o\\'erthrown,And the red blood in rivers flowedFrom slaughtered fiends o\\'er path and road.Canto XLVI. The Captains.Mad with the rage of injured prideKing Rávan summoned to his sideThe valiant five who led his host,Supreme in war and honoured most.\"Go forth,\" he cried, \"with car and steed,And to my feet this monkey lead,But watch each chance of time and placeTo seize this thing of silvan race.For from his wondrous exploits heNo monkey of the woods can be,But some new kind of creature meantTo work us woe, by Indra sent.Gandharvas, Nágas, and the bestOf Yakshas have our might confessed.Have we not challenged and subduedThe whole celestial multitude?Yet will you not, if you are wise,A chief of monkey race despise.For I myself have Báli known,And King Sugríva power I own.But none of all their woodland throngWas half so terrible and strong.\"Obedient to the words he spakeThey hastened forth the foe to take.Swift were the cars whereon they rode,And bright their weapons flashed and glowed.They saw: they charged in wild careerWith sword and mace and axe and spear.From Durdhar bow five arrows spedAnd quivered in the Vánar head.He rose and roared: the fearful soundMade all the region echo round.Then from above his weight he threwOn Durdhar car that near him drew.The weight that came with lightning speedCrushed pole and axle, car and steed.It shattered Durdhar head and neck,And left him lifeless mid the wreck.Yúpáksha saw the warrior die,And Virúpáksha heard his cry,And, mad for vengeance for the slain,They charged their Vánar foe again.He rose in air: they onward pressedAnd fiercely smote him on the breast.In vain they struck his iron frame:With eagle swoop to earth he came,Tore from the ground a tree that grewBeside him, and the demons slew.Then Bhásakama raised his spear,And Praghas with a laugh drew near,And, maddened at the sight, the twoAgainst the undaunted Vánar flew.As from his wounds the torrents flowed,Like a red sun the Vánar showed.He turned, a mountain peak to seizeWith all its beasts and snakes and trees.He hurled it on the pair: and theyCrushed, overwhelmed, beneath it lay.Canto XLVII. The Death Of Aksha.But Rávan, as his fury burned,His eyes on youthful Aksha(877) turned,Who rose impetuous at his glanceAnd shouted for his bow and lance.He rode upon a glorious carThat shot the light of gems afar.His pennon waved mid glittering goldAnd bright the wheels with jewels rolled,By long and fierce devotion wonThat car was splendid as the sun.With rows of various weapons stored;And thought-swift horses whirled their lordRacing along the earth, or roseHigh through the clouds whene\\'er he chose.Then fierce and fearful war betweenThe Vánar and the fiend was seen.The Gods and Asurs stood amazed,And on the wondrous combat gazed.A cry from earth rose long and shrill,The wind was hushed, the sun grew chill.The thunder bellowed from the sky,And troubled ocean roared reply.Thrice Aksha strained his dreadful bow,Thrice smote his arrow on the foe,And with full streams of crimson bledThree gashes in the Vánar head.Then rose Hanúmán in the airTo shun the shafts no life could bear.But Aksha in his car pursued,And from on high the fight renewedWith storm of arrows, thick as hailWhen angry clouds some hill assail.Impatient of that arrowy showerThe Vánar chief put forth his power,Again above his chariot roseAnd smote him with repeated blows.Terrific came each deadly stroke:Breast neck and arm and back he broke;And Aksha fell to earth, and layWith all his life-blood drained away.Canto XLVIII. Hanumán Captured.To Indrajít(878) the bold and braveThe giant king his mandate gave:\"O trained in warlike science, bestIn arms of all our mightiest,Whose valour in the conflict shownTo Asurs and to Gods is known,The Kinkars whom I sent are slain,And Jambumálí and his train;The lords who led our giant bandsHave fallen by the monkey hands;With shattered cars the ground is spread,And Aksha lies amid the dead.Thou art my best and bravest: go,Unmatched in power, and slay the foe.\"He heard the hest: he bent his head;Athirst for battle forth he sped.Four tigers fierce, of tawny hue,With fearful teeth, his chariot drew.Hanúmán heard his strong bow clang,And swiftly from the earth he sprang,While weak and ineffective fellThe archer shafts though pointed well.The Rákshas saw that naught might killThe wondrous foe who mocked his skill,And launched a magic shaft to throwA binding spell about his foe.Forth flew the shaft: the mystic charmStayed his swift feet and numbed his arm,Through all his frame he felt the spell,And motionless to earth he fell.Nor would the reverent Vánar looseThe bonds that bound him as a noose.He knew that Brahmá self had charmedThe weapon that his might disarmed.They saw him helpless on the ground,And all the giants pressed around,And bonds of hemp and bark were castAbout his limbs to hold him fast.They drew the ropes round feet and wrists;They beat him with their hands and fists,And dragged him as they strained the cordWith shouts of triumph to their lord.(879)Canto XLIX. Rávan.On the fierce king Hanúmán turnedHis angry eyes that glowed and burned.He saw him decked with wealth untoldOf diamond and pearl and gold,And priceless was each wondrous gemThat sparkled in his diadem.About his neck rich chains were twined,The best that fancy e\\'er designed,And a fair robe with pearls bestrungDown from his mighty shoulders hung.Ten heads he reared,(880) as Mandar hillLifts woody peaks which tigers fill,Bright were his eyes, and bright, beneath,The flashes of his awful teeth.His brawny arms of wondrous sizeWere decked with rings and scented dyes.His hands like snakes with five long headsDescending from their mountain beds.He sat upon a crystal throneInlaid with wealth of precious stone,Whereon, of noblest work, was setA gold-embroidered coverlet.Behind the monarch stood the bestOf beauteous women gaily dressed,And each her giant master fanned,Or waved a chourie in her hand.Four noble courtiers(881) wise and goodIn counsel, near the monarch stood,As the four oceans ever standAbout the sea-encompassed land.Still, though his heart with rage was fired,The Vánar marvelled and admired:\"O what a rare and wondrous sight!What beauty, majesty, and might!All regal pomp combines to graceThis ruler of the Rákshas race.He, if he scorned not right and law,Might guide the world with tempered awe:Yea, Indra and the Gods on highMight on his saving power rely.\"Canto L. Prahasta Questions.Then fierce the giant fury blazedAs on Hanúmán form he gazed,And shaken by each wild surmiseHe spake aloud with flashing eyes:\"Can this be Nandi(882) standing here,The mighty one whom all revere?Who once on high Kailása hillPronounced the curse that haunts me still?Or is the woodland creature oneOf Asur race, or Bali(883) son?The wretch with searching question try:Learn who he is, and whence; and whyHe marred the glory of the grove,And with my captains fiercely strove.\"Prahasta heard his lord behest,And thus the Vánar chief addressed:\"O monkey stranger be consoled:Fear not, and let thy heart be bold.If thou by Indra mandate sentThy steps to Lanká isle hast bent,With fearless words the cause explain,And freedom thou shalt soon regain.Or if thou comest as a spyDespatched by Vishnu in the sky,Or sent by Yáma, or the LordOf Riches, hast our town explored;Proved by the prowess thou hast shownNo monkey save in form alone;Speak boldly all the truth, and beReleased from bonds, unharmed and free.But falsehood spoken to our kingSwift punishment of death will bring.\"He ceased: the Vánar made reply;\"Not Indra messenger am I,Nor came I hither to fulfilKuvera hest or Vishnu will.I stand before the giants hereA Vánar e\\'en as I appear.I longed to see the king: \\'twas hardTo win my way through gate and guard.And so to gain my wish I laidIn ruin that delightful shade.No fiend, no God of heavenly kindWith bond or chain these limbs may bind.The Eternal Sire himself of oldVouchsafed the boon that makes me bold,From Brahmá magic shaft released(884)I knew the captor power had ceased,The fancied bonds I freely brooked,And thus upon the king have looked.My way to Lanká have I won,A messenger from Raghu son.\"Canto LI. Hanumán Reply.\"My king Sugríva greets thee fair,And bids me thus his rede declare.Son of the God of Wind, by nameHanumán, to this isle I came.To set the Maithil lady freeI crossed the barrier of the sea.I roamed in search of her and foundHer weeping in that lovely ground.Thou in the lore of duty trained,Who hast by stern devotion gainedThis wondrous wealth and power and fameShouldst fear to wrong another dame.Hear thou my counsel, and be wise:No fiend, no dweller in the skiesCan bear the shafts by Lakshman shot,Or Ráma when his wrath is hot.O Giant King, repent the crimeAnd soothe him while there yet is time.Now be the Maithil queen restoredUninjured to her sorrowing lord.Soon wilt thou rue thy dire mistake:She is no woman but a snake,Whose very deadly bite will beThe ruin of thy house and thee.Thy pride has led thy thoughts astray,That fancy not a hand may slayThe monarch of the giants, screenedFrom mortal blow of God and fiend.Sugríva still thy death may be:No Yaksha, fiend, or God is he,And Ráma from a woman springs,The mortal seed of mortal kings.O think how Báli fell subdued;Think on thy slaughtered multitude.Respect those brave and strong allies;Consult thy safety, and be wise.I, even I, no helper needTo overthrow, with car and steed,Thy city Lanká half divine:The power but not the will is mine.For Raghu son, before his friendThe Vánar monarch, swore to endWith his own conquering arm the lifeOf him who stole his darling wife.Turn, and be wise, O Rávan turn;Or thou wilt see thy Lanká burn,And with thy wives, friends, kith and kinBe ruined for thy senseless sin.\"Canto LII. Vibhishan Speech.Then Rávan spake with flashing eye:\"Hence with the Vánar: let him die.\"Vibhishan heard the stern behest,And pondered in his troubled breast;Then, trained in arts that soothe and pleaseAddressed the king in words like these:\"Revoke, my lord, thy fierce decree,And hear the words I speak to thee.Kings wise and noble ne\\'er condemnTo death the envoys sent to them.Such deed the world contempt would drawOn him who breaks the ancient law.(885)Observe the mean where justice lies,And spare his life but still chastise.\"Then forth the tyrant fury broke,And thus in angry words he spoke:\"O hero, when the wicked bleedNo sin or shame attends the deed.The Vánar blood must needs be spilt,The penalty of heinous guilt.\"Again Vibhishan made reply:\"Nay, hear me, for he must not die.Hear the great law the wise declare:\"Thy foeman envoy thou shalt spare.\"\\'Tis true he comes an open foe:\\'Tis true his hands have wrought us woe,But law allows thee, if thou wilt,A punishment to suit the guilt.The mark of shame, the scourge, the brand,The shaven head, the wounded hand.Yea, were the Vánar envoy slain,Where, King of giants, were the gain?On them alone, on them who sentThe message, be the punishment.For spake he well or spake he ill,He spake obedient to their will,And, if he perish, who can bearThy challenge to the royal pair?Who, cross the ocean and inciteThy death-doomed enemies to fight?\"Canto LIII. The Punishment.King Rávan, by his pleading moved,The counsel of the chief approved:\"Thy words are wise and true: to killAn envoy would beseem us ill.Yet must we for his crime inventSome fitting mode of punishment.The tail, I fancy, is the partMost cherished by a monkey heart.Make ready: set his tail aflame,And let him leave us as he came,And thus disfigured and disgracedBack to his king and people haste.\"The giants heard their monarch speech;And, filled with burning fury, eachBrought strips of cotton cloth, and roundThe monkey tail the bandage wound.As round his tail the bands they drewHis mighty form dilating grewVast as the flame that bursts on highWhere trees are old and grass is dry.Each band and strip they soaked in oil,And set on fire the twisted coil.Delighted as they viewed the blaze,The cruel demons stood at gaze:And mid loud drums and shells rang outThe triumph of their joyful shout.They pressed about him thick and fastAs through the crowded streets he passed,Observing with attentive careEach rich and wondrous structure there,Still heedless of the eager cryThat rent the air, The spy! the spy!Some to the captive lady ran,And thus in joyous words began:\"That copper-visaged monkey, heWho in the garden talked with thee,Through Lanká town is led a show,And round his tail the red flames glow.\"The mournful news the lady heardThat with fresh grief her bosom stirred.Swift to the kindled fire she wentAnd prayed before it reverent:\"If I my husband have obeyed,And kept the ascetic vows I made,Free, ever free, from stain and blot,O spare the Vánar; harm him not.\"Then leapt on high the flickering flameAnd shone in answer to the dame.The pitying fire its rage forbore:The Vánar felt the heat no more.Then, to minutest size reduced,The bonds that bound his limbs he loosed,And, freed from every band and chain,Rose to his native size again.He seized a club of ponderous weightThat lay before him by the gate,Rushed at the fiends that hemmed him round,And laid them lifeless on the ground.Through Lanká town again he strode,And viewed each street and square and road,--Still wreathed about with harmless blaze,A sun engarlanded with rays.Canto LIV. The Burning Of Lanká.\"What further deed remains to doTo vex the Rákshas king anew?The beauty of his grove is marred,Killed are the bravest of his guard.The captains of his host are slain;But forts and palaces remain,Swift is the work and light the toilEach fortress of the foe to spoil.\"Reflecting thus, his tail ablazeAs through the cloud red lightning plays,He scaled the palaces and spreadThe conflagration where he sped.From house to house he hurried on,And the wild flames behind him shone.Each mansion of the foe he scaled,And furious fire its roof assailedTill all the common ruin shared:Vibhishan house alone was spared.From blazing pile to pile he sprang,And loud his shout of triumph rang,As roars the doomsday cloud when allThe worlds in dissolution fall.The friendly wind conspired to fanThe hungry flames that leapt and ran,And spreading in their fury caughtThe gilded walls with pearls inwrought,Till each proud palace reeled and fellAs falls a heavenly citadel.Loud was the roar the demons raisedMid walls that split and beams that blazed,As each with vain endeavour stroveTo stay the flames in house or grove.The women, with dishevelled hair,Flocked to the roofs in wild despair,Shrieked out for succour, wept aloud,And fell, like lightning from a cloud.He saw the flames ascend and curlRound turkis, diamond, and pearl,While silver floods and molten goldFrom ruined wall and latice rolled.As fire grows fiercer as he feedsOn wood and grass and crackling reeds,So Hanúmán the ruin eyedWith fury still unsatisfied.Canto LV. Fear For Sítá.But other thoughts resumed their swayWhen Lanká town in ruin lay;And, as his bosom felt their weightHe stood a while to meditate.\"What have I done?\", he thought with shame,\"Destroyed the town with hostile flame.O happy they whose firm controlChecks the wild passion of the soul;Who on the fires of anger throwThe cooling drops that check their glow.But woe is me, whom wrath could leadTo do this senseless shameless deed.The town to fire and death I gave,Nor thought of her I came to save,--Doomed by my own rash folly, doomedTo perish in the flames consumed.If I, when anger drove me wild,Have caused the death of Janak child,The kindled flame shall end my woe,Or the deep fires that burn below,(886)Or my forsaken corse shall beFood for the monsters of the sea.How can I meet Sugríva? howBefore the royal brothers bow,--I whose rash deed has madly foiled,The noble work in which we toiled?Or has her own bright virtue shedIts guardian influence round her head?She lives untouched,--the peerless dame;Flame has no fury for the flame.(887)The very fire would ne\\'er consentTo harm a queen so excellent,--The high-souled Ráma faithful wife,Protected by her holy life.She lives, she lives. Why should I fearFor one whom Raghu sons hold dear?Has not the pitying fire that sparedThe Vánar for the lady cared?\"Such were his thoughts: he pondered long,And fear grew faint and hope grew strong.Then round him heavenly voices rang,And, sweetly tuned, his praises sang:\"O glorious is the exploit doneBy Hanumán the Wind-God son.The flames o\\'er Lanká city rise:The giants\\' home in ruin lies.O\\'er roof and wall the fires have spread,Nor harmed a hair of Sítá head.\"Canto LVI. Mount Arishta.He looked upon the burning waste,Then sought the queen in joyous haste,With words of hope consoled her heart,And made him ready to depart.He scaled Arishta glorious steepWhose summits beetled o\\'er the deep.The woods in varied beauty dressedHung like a garland round his crest,And clouds of ever changing hueA robe about his shoulders threw.On him the rays of morning fellTo wake the hill they loved so well,And bid unclose those splendid eyesThat glittered in his mineral dyes.He woke to hear the music madeBy thunders of the white cascade,While every laughing rill that sprangFrom crag to crag its carol sang.For arms, he lifted to the starsHis towering stems of Deodárs,And morning heard his pealing callIn tumbling brook and waterfall.He trembled when his woods were paleAnd bowed beneath the autumn gale,And when his vocal reeds were stirredHis melancholy moan was heard.Far down against the mountain feetThe Vánar heard the wild waves beat;Then turned his glances to the north.Sprang from the peak and bounded forth,The mountain felt the fearful shockAnd trembled through his mass of rock.The tallest trees were crushed and rentAnd headlong to the valley sent,And as the rocking shook each caveLoud was the roar the lions gave.Forth from the shaken cavern cameFierce serpents with their tongues aflame;And every Yaksha, wild with dread,And Kinnar and Gandharva, fled.Canto LVII. Hanumán Return.Still, like a winged mountain, heSprang forward through the airy sea,(888)And rushing through the ether drewThe clouds to follow as he flew,Through the great host around him spread,Grey, golden, dark, and white, and red.Now in a sable cloud immersed,Now from its gloomy pall he burst,Like the bright Lord of Stars concealedA moment, and again revealed.Sunábha(889) passed, he neared the coastWhere waited still the Vánar host.They heard a rushing in the skies,And lifted up their wondering eyes.His wild triumphant shout they knewThat louder still and louder grew,And Jámbaván with eager voiceCalled on the Vánars to rejoice:\"Look he returns, the Wind-God son,And full success his toils have won;Triumphant is the shout that comesLike music of a thousand drums.\"Up sprang the Vánars from the groundAnd listened to the wondrous soundOf hurtling arm and thigh as throughThe region of the air he flew,Loud as the wind, when tempests rave,Roars in the prison of the cave.From crag to crag, from height to height;They bounded in their mad delight,And when he touched the mountain crest,With reverent welcome round him pressed.They brought him of their woodland fruits,They brought him of the choicest roots,And laughed and shouted in their gleeThe noblest of their chiefs to see.Nor Hanumán delayed to greetSage Jámbaván with reverence meet;To Angad and the chiefs he bentFor age and rank preëminent,And briefly spoke: \"These eyes have seen,These lips addressed, the Maithil queen.\"They sat beneath the waving trees,And Angad spoke in words like these:\"O noblest of the Vánar kindFor valour power and might combined,To thee triumphant o\\'er the foeOur hopes, our lives and all we owe.O faithful heart in perils tried,Which toil nor fear could turn aside,Thy deed the lady will restore,And Ráma heart will ache no more.\"(890)Canto LVIII. The Feast Of Honey.They rose in air: the region grewDark with their shadow as they flew.Swift to a lovely grove(891) they cameThat rivalled heavenly Nandan(892) fame;Where countless bees their honey stored,--The pleasance of the Vánars\\' lord,To every creature fenced and barred,Which Dadhimukh was set to guard,A noble Vánar, brave and bold,Sugríva uncle lofty-souled.To Angad came with one accordThe Vánars, and besought their lordThat they those honeyed stores might eatThat made the grove so passing sweet.He gave consent: they sought the treesThronged with innumerable bees.They rifled all the treasured store,And ate the fruit the branches bore,And still as they prolonged the feastTheir merriment and joy increased.Drunk with the sweets, they danced and bowed,They wildly sang, they laughed aloud,Some climbed and sprang from tree to tree,Some sat and chattered in their glee.Some scaled the trees which creepers crowned,And rained the branches to the ground.There with loud laugh a Vánar sprangClose to his friend who madly sang,In doleful mood another creptTo mix his tears with one who wept.Then Dadhimukh with fury viewedThe intoxicated multitude.He looked upon the rifled shade,And all the ruin they had made;Then called with angry voice, and stroveTo save the remnant of the grove.But warning cries and words were spurned,And angry taunt and threat returned.Then fierce and wild contention rose:With furious words he mingled blows.They by no shame or fear withheld,By drunken mood and ire impelled,Used claws, and teeth, and hands, and beatThe keeper under trampling feet.[Three Cantos consisting of little but repetitions are omitted. Dadhimukhescapes from the infuriated monkeys and hastens to Sugríva to report theirmisconduct. Sugríva infers that Hanumán and his band have been successfulin their search, and that the exuberance of spirits and the mischiefcomplained of, are but the natural expression of their joy. Dadhimukhobtains little sympathy from Sugríva, and is told to return and send themonkeys on with all possible speed.]Canto LXV. The Tidings.On to Prasravan hill they spedWhere blooming trees their branches spread.To Raghu sons their heads they bentAnd did obeisance reverent.Then to their king, by Angad led,Each Vánar chieftain bowed his head;And Hanumán the brave and boldHis tidings to the monarch told;But first in Ráma hand he placedThe gem that Sítá brow had graced:\"I crossed the sea: I searched a whileFor Sítá in the giants\\' isle.I found her vext with taunt and threatBy demon guards about her set.Her tresses twined in single braid,On the bare earth her limbs were laid.Sad were her eyes: her cheeks were paleAs shuddering flowers in winter gale.I stood beside the weeping dame,And gently whispered Ráma name:With cheering words her grief consoled,And then the whole adventure told.She weeps afar beyond the sea,And her true heart is still with thee.She gave a sign that thou wouldst know,She bids thee think upon the crow,And bright mark pressed upon her browWhen none was nigh but she and thou.She bids thee take this precious stone,The sea-born gem thou long hast known.\"And I,\" she said, \"will dull the stingOf woe by gazing on the ring.One little month shall I sustainThis life oppressed with woe and pain:And when the month is ended, IThe giants\\' prey must surely die.\\' \"Canto LXVI. Ráma Speech.There ceased the Vánar: Ráma pressedThe treasured jewel to his breast,And from his eyes the waters brokeAs to the Vánar king he spoke:\"As o\\'er her babe the mother weeps,This flood of tears the jewel steeps.This gem that shone on Sítá headWas Janak gift when we were wed,And the pure brow that wore it lentNew splendour to the ornament.This gem, bright offspring of the wave,The King of Heaven to Janak gave,Whose noble sacrificial riteHad filled the God with new delight.Now, as I gaze upon the prize,Methinks I see my father eyes.Methinks I see before me standThe ruler of Videha land.(893)Methinks mine arms are folded nowRound her who wore it on her brow.Speak, Hanumán, O say, dear friend,What message did my darling send?O speak, and let thy words impartTheir gentle dew to cool my heart.Ah, \\'tis the crown of woe to seeThis gem and ask \"Where, where is she?\"If for one month her heart be strong,Her days of life will yet be long.But I, with naught to lend relief,This very day must die of grief.Come, Hanumán, and quickly guideThe mourner to his darling side.O lead me--thou hast learnt the way--I cannot and I will not stay.How can my gentle love endure,So timid, delicate, and pure,The dreadful demons fierce and vileWho watch her in the guarded isle?No more the light of beauty shinesFrom Sítá as she weeps and pines.But pain and sorrow, cloud on cloudHer moonlight glory dim and shroud.O speak, dear Hanumán, and tellEach word that from her sweet lips fell,Her words, her words alone can giveThe healing balm to make me live.\"(894)',\n",
       " 'BOOK 6': 'Canto I. Ráma Speech.The son of Raghu heard, consoled,The wondrous tale Hanumán told;And, as his joyous hope grew high,In friendly words he made reply:\"Behold a mighty task achieved,Which never heart but his conceived.Who else across the sea can spring,Save Váyu(896) and the Feathered King?(897)Who, pass the portals strong and highWhich Nágas,(898) Gods, and fiends defy,Where Rávan hosts their station keep,--And come uninjured o\\'er the deep?By such a deed the Wind-God sonGood service to the king has done,And saved from ruin and disgraceLakshman and me and Raghu race.Well has he planned and bravely fought,And with due care my lady sought.But of the sea I sadly think,And the sweet hopes that cheered me sink.How can we cross the leagues of foamThat keep us from the giant home?What can the Vánar legions moreThan muster on the ocean shore?\"Canto II. Sugríva Speech.He ceased: and King Sugríva triedTo calm his grief, and thus replied:\"\\'Be to thy nobler nature true,Nor let despair thy soul subdue.This cloud of causeless woe dispel,For all as yet has prospered well,And we have traced thy queen, and knowThe dwelling of our Rákshas foe.Arise, consult: thy task must beTo cast a bridge athwart the sea,The city of our foe to reachThat crowns the mountain by the beach;And when our feet that isle shall tread,Rejoice and deem thy foeman dead.The sea unbridged, his walls defyBoth fiends and children of the sky,Though at the fierce battalions\\' headLord Indra self the onset led.Yea, victory is thine beforeThe long bridge touch the farther shore,So fleet and fierce and strong are theseWho limb them as their fancies please.Away with grief and sad surmiseThat mar the noblest enterprise,And with their weak suspicion blightThe sage plan, the hero might.Come, this degenerate weakness spurn,And bid thy dauntless heart return,For each fair hope by grief is crossedWhen those we love are dead or lost.Arise, O best of those who know,Arm for the giant overthrow.None in the triple world I seeWho in the fight may equal thee;None who before thy face may standAnd brave the bow that arms thy hand,Trust to these mighty Vánars: theyWith full success thy trust will pay,When thou shalt reach the robber hold,And loving arms round Sítá fold.\"Canto III. Lanká.He ceased: and Raghu son gave heed,Attentive to his prudent rede:Then turned again, with hope inspired,To Hanumán, and thus inquired:\"Light were the task for thee, I ween,To bridge the sea that gleams betweenThe mainland and the island shore.Or dry the deep and guide as o\\'er.Fain would I learn from thee whose feetHave trod the stones of every street,Of fenced Lanká towers and forts,And walls and moats and guarded ports,And castles where the giants dwell,And battlemented citadel.O Váyu son, describe it all,With palace, fort, and gate, and wall.\"He ceased: and, skilled in arts that guideThe eloquent, the chief replied:\"Vast is the city, gay and strong,Where elephants unnumbered throng,And countless hosts of Rákshas breedStand ready by the car and steed.Four massive gates, securely barred,All entrance to the city guard,With murderous engines fixt to throwBolt, arrow, rock to check the foe,And many a mace with iron headThat strikes at once a hundred dead.Her golden ramparts wide and highWith massy strength the foe defy,Where inner walls their rich inlayOf coral, turkis, pearl display.Her circling moats are broad and deep,Where ravening monsters dart and leap.By four great piers each moat is spannedWhere lines of deadly engines stand.In sleepless watch at every gateUnnumbered hosts of giants wait,And, masters of each weapon, rearThe threatening pike and sword and spear.My fury hurled those ramparts down,Filled up the moats that gird the town,The piers and portals overturned,And stately Lanká spoiled and burned.Howe\\'er we Vánars force our wayO\\'er the wide seat of Varun(899) sway,Be sure that city of the foeIs doomed to sudden overthrow,Nay, why so vast an army lead?Brave Angad, Dwivid good at need,Fierce Mainda, Panas famed in fight,And Níla skill and Nala might,And Jámbaván the strong and wise,Will dare the easy enterprise.Assailed by these shall Lanká fallWith gate and rampart, tower and wall.Command the gathering, chief: and theyIn happy hour will haste away.\"Canto IV. The March.He ceased; and spurred by warlike prideThe impetuous son of Raghu cried:\"Soon shall mine arm with wrathful joyThat city of the foe destroy.Now, chieftain, now collect the host,And onward to the southern coast!The sun in his meridian towerGives glory to the Vánar power.The demon lord who stole my queenBy timely flight his life may screen.She, when she knows her lord is near,Will cling to hope and banish fear,Saved like a dying wretch who sipsThe drink of Gods with fevered lips.Arise, thy troops to battle lead:All happy omens counsel speed.The Lord of Stars in favouring skiesBodes glory to our enterprise.This arm shall slay the fiend; and she,My consort, shall again be free.Mine upward-throbbing eye foreshowsThe longed-for triumph o\\'er my foes.Far in the van be Níla post,To scan the pathway for the host,And let thy bravest and thy best,A hundred thousand, wait his hest.Go forth, O warrior Níla, leadThe legions on through wood and meadWhere pleasant waters cool the ground,And honey, flowers, and fruit abound.Go, and with timely care preventThe Rákshas foeman dark intent.With watchful troops each valley guardEre brooks and fruits and roots be marredAnd search each glen and leafy shadeFor hostile troops in ambuscade.But let the weaklings stay behind:For heroes is our task designed.Let thousands of the Vánar breedThe vanguard of the armies lead:Fierce and terrific must it beAs billows of the stormy sea.There be the hill-huge Gaja place,And Gavaya, strongest of his race,And, like the bull that leads the herd,Gaváksha, by no fears deterredLet Rishabh, matchless in the mightOf warlike arms, protect our right,And Gandhamádan next in rankDefend and guide the other flank.I, like the God who rules the skyBorne on Airávat(900) mounted highOn stout Hanúmán back will ride,The central host to cheer and guide.Fierce as the God who rules below,On Angad back let Lakshman showLike him who wealth to mortals shares,(901)The lord whom Sárvabhauma(902) bears.The bold Sushen impetuous might,And Vegadarsí piercing sight,And Jámbaván whom bears revere,Illustrious three, shall guard the rear.\"He ceased, the royal Vánar heard,And swift, obedient to his word,Sprang forth in numbers none might tellFrom mountain, cave, and bosky dell,From rocky ledge and breezy height,Fierce Vánars burning for the fight.And Ráma course was southward bentAmid the mighty armament.On, joyous, pressed in close arrayThe hosts who owned Sugríva sway,With nimble feet, with rapid boundExploring, ere they passed, the ground,While from ten myriad throats rang outThe challenge and the battle shout.On roots and honeycomb they fed,And clusters from the boughs o\\'erhead,Or from the ground the tall trees toreRich with the flowery load they bore.Some carried comrades, wild with mirth,Then cast their riders to the earth,Who swiftly to their feet aroseAnd overthrew their laughing foes.While still rang out the general cry,\"King Rávan and his fiends shall die,\"Still on, exulting in the prideOf conscious strength, the Vánars hied,And gazed where noble Sahya, bestOf mountains, raised each towering crest.They looked on lake and streamlet, whereThe lotus bloom was bright and fair,Nor marched--for Ráma hest they fearedWhere town or haunt of men appeared.Still onward, fearful as the wavesOf Ocean when he roars and raves,Led by their eager chieftains, wentThe Vánars\\' countless armament.Each captain, like a noble steedUrged by the lash to double speed.Pressed onward, filled with zeal and pride,By Ráma and his brother side,Who high above the Vánar throngOn mighty backs were borne along,Like the great Lords of Day and NightSeized by eclipsing planets might.Then Lakshman radiant as the morn,On Angad shoulders high upborne.With sweet consoling words that wokeNew ardour, to his brother spoke:\"Soon shalt thou turn, thy queen regainedAnd impious Rávan life-blood drained,In happiness and high renownTo dear Ayodhyá happy town.I see around exceeding fairAll omens of the earth and air.Auspicious breezes sweet and lowTo greet the Vánar army blow,And softly to my listening earCome the glad cries of bird and deer.Bright is the sky around us, brightWithout a cloud the Lord of Light,And Sukra(903) with propitious loveLooks on thee from his throne above.The pole-star and the Sainted Seven(904)Shine brightly in the northern heaven,And great Trisanku,(905) glorious king,Ikshváku son from whom we spring,Beams in unclouded glory nearHis holy priest(906) whom all revere.Undimmed the two Visákhás(907) shine,The strength and glory of our line,And Nairrit(908) influence that aidsOur Rákshas foemen faints and fades.The running brooks are fresh and fair,The boughs their ripening clusters bear,And scented breezes gently swayThe leaflet of the tender spray.See, with a glory half divineThe Vánars\\' ordered legions shine,Bright as the Gods\\' exultant trainWho saw the demon Tárak slain.O let thine eyes these signs behold,And bid thy heart be glad and bold.\"The Vánar squadrons densely spreadO\\'er all the country onward sped,While rising from the rapid beatOf bears\\' and monkeys\\' hastening feet.Dust hid the earth with thickest veil,And made the struggling sunbeams pale.Now where Mahendra peaks ariseCame Ráma of the lotus eyesAnd the long arm resistless might,And clomb the mountain wood-crowned height.Thence Dasaratha son beheldWhere billowy Ocean rose and swelled,Past Malaya peaks and Sahya chainThe Vánar legions reached the main,And stood in many a marshalled bandOn loud-resounding Ocean strand.To the fair wood that fringed the tideCame Dasaratha son, and cried:\"At length, my lord Sugríva, weHave reached King Varun realm the sea,And one great thought, still-vexing, howTo cross the flood, awaits us now.The broad deep ocean, that deniesA passage, stretched before us lies.Then let us halt and plan the whileHow best to storm the giant isle.\"He ceased: Sugríva on the coastBy trees o\\'ershadowed stayed the host,That seemed in glittering lines to beThe bright waves of a second sea.Then from the shore the captains gazedOn billows which the breezes raisedTo fury, as they dashed in foamO\\'er Varun realm, the Asurs\\' home:(909)The sea that laughed with foam, and dancedWith waves whereon the sunbeams glanced:Where, when the light began to fade,Huge crocodiles and monsters played;And, when the moon went up the sky,The troubled billows rose on highFrom the wild watery world whereonA thousand moons reflected shone:Where awful serpents swam and showedTheir fiery crests which flashed and glowed,Illumining the depths of hell,The prison where the demons dwell.The eye, bewildered, sought in vainThe bounding line of sky and main:Alike in shade, alike in glowWere sky above and sea below.There wave-like clouds by clouds were chased,Here cloud-like billows roared and raced:Then shone the stars, and many a gemThat lit the waters answered them.They saw the great-souled Ocean stirredTo frenzy by the winds, and heard,Loud as ten thousand drums, the roarOf wild waves dashing on the shore.They saw him mounting to defyWith deafening voice the troubled sky.And the deep bed beneath him swellIn fury as the billows fell.Canto V. Ráma Lament.There on the coast in long arrayThe Vánars\\' marshalled legions lay,Where Níla care had ordered wellThe watch of guard and sentinel,And Mainda moved from post to postWith Dwivid to protect the host.Then Ráma stood by Lakshman side,And mastered by his sorrow cried:\"My brother dear, the heart distress,As days wear on, grows less and less.But my deep-seated grief, alas,Grows fiercer as the seasons pass.Though for my queen my spirit longs,And broods indignant o\\'er my wrongs,Still wilder is my grief to knowThat her young life is passed in woe.Breathe, gentle gale, O breathe where sheLies prisoned, and then breathe on me,And, though my love I may not meet,Thy kiss shall be divinely sweet.Ah, by the giant shape appalled,On her dear lord for help she called,Still in mine ears the sad cry ringsAnd tears my heart with poison stings.Through the long daylight and the gloomOf night wild thoughts of her consumeMy spirit, and my love suppliesThe torturing flame which never dies.Leave me, my brother; I will sleepCouched on the bosom of the deep,For the cold wave may bring me peaceAnd bid the fire of passion cease.One only thought my stay must be,That earth, one earth, holds her and me,To hear, to know my darling livesSome life-supporting comfort gives,As streams from distant fountains runO\\'er meadows parching in the sun.Ah when, my foeman at my feet,Shall I my queen, my glory, meet,The blossom of her dear face raiseAnd on her eyes enraptured gaze,Press her soft lips to mine again,And drink a balm to banish pain!Alas, alas! where lies she now,My darling of the lovely brow?On the cold earth, no help at hand,Forlorn amid the Rákshas band,King Janak child still calls on me,Her lord and love, to set her free.But soon in glory will she riseA crescent moon in autumn skies,And those dark rovers of the night,Like scattered clouds shall turn in flight.\"Canto VI. Rávan Speech.But when the giant king surveyedHis glorious town in ruin laid,And each dire sign of victory wonBy Hanumán the Wind-God son,He vailed his angry eyes oppressedBy shame, and thus his lords addressed:\"The Vánar spy has passed the gateOf Lanká long inviolate,Eluded watch and ward, and seenWith his bold eyes the captive queen.My royal roof with flames is red,The bravest of my lords are dead,And the fierce Vánar in his hateHas left our city desolate.Now ponder well the work that liesBefore us, ponder and advise.With deep-observing judgment scanThe peril, and mature a plan.From counsel, sages say, the root,Springs victory, most glorious fruit.First ranks the king, when woe impendsWho seeks the counsel of his friends,Of kinsmen ever faithful found,Or those whose hopes with his are bound,Then with their aid his strength applies,And triumphs in his enterprise.Next ranks the prince who plans alone,No counsel seeks to aid his own,Weighs loss and gain and wrong and right,And seeks success with earnest might.Unwisest he who spurns delays,Who counts no cost, no peril weighs,Speeds to his aim, defying fate,And risks his all, precipitate.Thus too in counsel sages findA best, a worst, a middle kind.When gathered counsellors exploreThe way by light of holy lore,And all from first to last agree,Is the best counsel of the three.Next, if debate first waxes high,And each his chosen plan would tryTill all agree at last, we deemThis counsel second in esteem.Worst of the three is this, when eachAssails with taunt his fellow speech;When all debate, and no consentConcludes the angry argument.Consult then, lords; my task shall beTo crown with act your wise decree.With thousands of his wild alliesThe vengeful Ráma hither hies;With unresisted might and speedAcross the flood his troops will lead,Or for the Vánar host will drainThe channels of the conquered main.\"Canto VII. Rávan Encouraged.He ceased: they scorned, with blinded eyes,The foeman and his bold allies,Raised reverent hands with one accord,And thus made answer to their lord:\"Why yield thee, King, to causeless fear?A mighty host with sword and spearAnd mace and axe and pike and lanceWaits but thy signal to advance.Art thou not he who slew of oldThe Serpent-Gods, and stormed their hold;Scaled Mount Kailása and o\\'erthrewKuvera(910) and his Yaksha crew,Compelling Siva haughty friendBeneath a mightier arm to bend?Didst thou not bring from realms afarThe marvel of the magic car,When they who served Kuvera fellCrushed in their mountain citadel?Attracted by thy matchless fameTo thee, a suppliant, Maya came,The lord of every Dánav band,And won thee with his daughter hand.Thy arm in hell itself was felt,Where Vásuki(911) and Sankha dwelt,And they and Takshak, overthrown,Were forced thy conquering might to own.The Gods in vain their blessing gaveTo heroes bravest of the brave,Who strove a year and, sorely pressed,Their victor peerless might confessed.In vain their magic arts they tried,In vain thy matchless arm defiedKing Varun sons with fourfold force,Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,But for a while thy power withstood,And, conquered, mourned their hardihood.Thou hast encountered, face to face,King Yáma(912) with his murdering mace.Fierce as the wild tempestuous sea,What terror had his wrath for thee,Though death in every threatening form,And woe and torment, urged the storm?Thine arm a glorious victory wonO\\'er the dread king who pities none;And the three worlds, from terror freed,In joyful wonder praised thy deed.The tribe of Warriors, strong and dreadAs Indra self, o\\'er earth had spread;As giant trees that towering standIn mountain glens, they filled the land.Can Raghu son encounter foesFierce, numerous, and strong as those?Yet, trained in war and practised well,O\\'ermatched by thee, they fought and fell,Stay in thy royal home, nor careThe battle and the toil to share;But let the easy fight be wonBy Indrajít(913) thy matchless son.All, all shall die, if thou permit,Slain by the hand of Indrajít.\"Canto VIII. Prahasta Speech.Dark as a cloud of autumn, dreadPrahasta joined his palms and said:\"Gandharvas, Gods, the hosts who dwellIn heaven, in air, in earth, in hell,Have yielded to thy might, and howShall two weak men oppose thee now?Hanúmán came, a foe disguised,And mocked us heedless and surprised,Or never had he lived to fleeAnd boast that he has fought with me.Command, O King, and this right handShall sweep the Vánars from the land,And hill and dale, to Ocean shore,Shall know the death-doomed race no more.But let my care the means deviseTo guard thy city from surprise.\"Then Durmukh cried, of Rákshas race:\"Too long we brook the dire disgrace.He gave our city to the flames,He trod the chambers of thy dames.Ne\\'er shall so weak and vile a thingUnpunished brave the giants\\' king.Now shall this single arm attackAnd drive the daring Vánars back,Till to the winds of heaven they flee,Or seek the depths of earth and sea.\"Then, brandishing the mace he bore,Whose horrid spikes were stained with gore,While fury made his eyeballs red,Impetuous Vajradanshtra said:\"Why waste a thought on one so vileAs Hanúmán the Vánar, whileSugríva, Lakshman, yet remain,And Ráma mightier still, unslain?This mace to-day shall crush the three,And all the host will turn and flee.Listen, and I will speak: incline,O King, to hear these words of mine,For the deep plan that I proposeWill swiftly rid thee of thy foes.Let thousands of thy host assumeThe forms of men in youthful bloom,In war magnificent arrayDraw near to Raghu son, and say:\"Thy younger brother Bharat sendsThis army, and thy cause befriends.\"Then let our legions hasten nearWith bow and mace and sword and spear,And on the Vánar army rainOur steel and stone till all be slain.If Raghu sons will fain believe,Entangled in the net we weave,The penalty they both must pay,And lose their forfeit lives to-day.\"Then with his warrior soul on fire,Nikumbha spoke in burning ire:\"I, only I, will take the field,And Raghu son his life shall yield.Within these walls, O Chiefs, abide,Nor part ye from our monarch side.\"Canto IX. Vibhishan Counsel.A score of warriors(914) forward sprang,And loud the clashing iron rangOf mace and axe and spear and sword,As thus they spake unto their lord:\"Their king Sugríva will we slay,And Raghu sons, ere close of day,And strike the wretch Hanúmán down,The spoiler of our golden town.\"But sage Vibhishan strove to calmThe chieftains\\' fury; palm to palmHe joined in lowly reverence, pressed(915)Before them, and the throng addressed:\"Dismiss the hope of conquering oneSo stern and strong as Raghu son.In due control each sense he keepsWith constant care that never sleeps.Whose daring heart has e\\'er conceivedThe exploit Hanumán achieved,Across the fearful sea to spring,The tributary rivers\\' king?O Rákshas lords, in time be wise,Nor Ráma matchless power despise.And say, what evil had the sonOf Raghu to our monarch done,Who stole the dame he loved so wellAnd keeps her in his citadel;If Khara in his foolish prideEncountered Ráma, fought, and died,May not the meanest love his lifeAnd guard it in the deadly strife?The Maithil dame, O Rákshas King,Sore peril to thy realm will bring.Restore her while there yet is time,Nor let us perish for thy crime.O, let the Maithil lady goEre the avenger bend his bowTo ruin with his arrowy showersOur Lanká with her gates and towers.Let Janak child again be freeEre the wild Vánars cross the sea,In their resistless might assailOur city and her ramparts scale.Ah, I conjure thee by the tiesOf brotherhood, be just and wise.In all my thoughts thy good I seek,And thus my prudent counsel speak.Let captive Sítá be restoredEre, fierce as autumn sun, her lordSend his keen arrows from the stringTo drink the life-blood of our king.This fury from thy soul dismiss,The bane of duty, peace, and bliss.Seek duty path and walk therein,And joy and endless glory win.Restore the captive, ere we feelThe piercing point of Ráma steel.O spare thy city, spare the livesOf us, our friends, our sons and wives.\"Thus spake Vibhishan wise and brave:The Rákshas king no answer gave,But bade his lords the council close,And sought his chamber for repose.Canto X. Vibhishan Counsel.Soon as the light of morning broke,Vibhishan from his slumber woke,And, duty guiding every thought,The palace of his brother sought.Vast as a towering hill that showsHis peaks afar, that palace rose.Here stood within the monarch gateSage nobles skilful in debate.There strayed in glittering raiment throughThe courts his royal retinue,Where in wild measure rose and fellThe music of the drum and shell,And talk grew loud, and many a dameOf fairest feature went and cameThrough doors a marvel to behold,With pearl inlaid on burning gold:Therein Gandharvas or the fleetLords of the storm might joy to meet.He passed within the wondrous pile,Chief glory of the giants\\' isle:Thus, ere his fiery course be done,An autumn cloud admits the sun.He heard auspicious voices raiseWith loud accord the note of praise,And sages, deep in Scripture, singEach glorious triumph of the king.He saw the priests in order stand,Curd, oil, in every sacred hand;And by them flowers were laid and grain,Due offerings to the holy train.Vibhishan to the monarch bowed,Raised on a throne above the crowd:Then, skilled in arts of soft address,He raised his voice the king to bless,And sate him on a seat where heFull in his brother sight should be.The chieftain there, while none could hear,Spoke his true speech for Rávan ear,And to his words of wisdom lentThe force of weightiest argument:\"O brother, hear! since Ráma queenA captive in thy house has been,Disastrous omens day by dayHave struck our souls with wild dismay.No longer still and strong and clearThe flames of sacrifice appear,But, restless with the frequent spark,Neath clouds of smoke grow faint and dark.Our ministering priests turn paleTo see their wonted offerings fail,And ants and serpents creep and crawlWithin the consecrated hall.(916)Dried are the udders of our cows,Our elephants have juiceless brows,(917)Nor can the sweetest pasture stayThe charger long unquiet neigh.Big tears from mules and camels flowWhose staring coats their trouble show,Nor can the leech art restoreTheir health and vigour as before.Rapacious birds are fierce and bold:Not single hunters as of old,In banded troops they chase the prey,Or gathering on our temples stay.Through twilight hours with shriek and howlAround the city jackals prowl,And wolves and foul hyćnas waitAthirst for blood at every gate.One sole atonement still may cureThese evils, and our weal assure.Restore the Maithil dame, and winAn easy pardon for thy sin.\"The Rákshas monarch heard, and movedTo sudden wrath his speech reproved:\"No danger, brother, can I see:The Maithil dame I will not free.Though all the Gods for Ráma fight,He yields to my superior might.\"Thus the tremendous king who brokeThe ranks of heavenly warriors spoke,And, sternly purposed to resist,His brother from the hall dismissed.Canto XI. The Summons.Still Rávan haughty heart rebelled,The counsel of the wise repelled,And, as his breast with passion burned,His thoughts again to Sítá turned.Thus, to each sign of danger blind,To love and war he still inclined.Then mounted he his car that glowedWith gems and golden net, and rodeWhere, gathered at the monarch call,The nobles filled the council hall.A host of warriors bright and gayWith coloured robes and rich array,With shield and mace and spear and sword,Followed the chariot of their lord.Mid the loud voice of shells and beatOf drums he raced along the street,And, ere he came, was heard afarThe rolling thunder of his car.He reached the doors: the nobles bentTheir heads before him reverent:And, welcomed with their loud acclaim,Within the glorious hall he came.He sat upon a royal seatWith golden steps beneath his feet,And bade the heralds summon allHis captains to the council hall.The heralds heard the words he spake,And sped from house to house to wakeThe giants where they slept or spentThe careless hours in merriment.These heard the summons and obeyed:From chamber, grove, and colonnade,On elephants or cars they rode,Or through the streets impatient strode.As birds on rustling pinions flyThrough regions of the darkened sky,Thus cars and mettled coursers throughThe crowded streets of Lanká flew.The council hall was reached, and then,As lions seek their mountain den,Through massy doors that opened wide,With martial stalk the captains hied.Welcomed with honour as was meetThey stooped to press their monarch feet,And each a place in order foundOn stool, on cushion, or the ground.Nor did the sage Vibhishan longDelay to join the noble throng.High on a car that shone like flameWith gold and flashing gems he came,Drew near and spoke his name aloud,And reverent to his brother bowed.Canto XII. Rávan Speech.The king in counsel unsurpassedHis eye around the synod cast,And fierce Prahasta, first and bestOf all his captains, thus addressed:\"Brave master of each warlike art,Arouse thee and perform thy part.Array thy fourfold forces(918) wellTo guard our isle and citadel.\"The captain of the hosts obeyed,The troops with prudent skill arrayed;Then to the hall again he hied,And stood before the king and cried:\"Each inlet to the town is closedWithout, within, are troops disposed.With fearless heart thine aim pursueAnd do the deed thou hast in view.\"Thus spoke Prahasta in the zealThat moved him for the kingdom weal.And thus the monarch, who pursuedHis own delight, his speech renewed:\"In ease and bliss, in toil and pain,In doubts of duty, pleasure, gain,Your proper path I need not tell,For of yourselves ye know it well.The Storm-Gods, Moon, and planets bringNew glory to their heavenly king,(919)And, ranged about your monarch, yeGive joy and endless fame to me.My secret counsel have I kept,While senseless Kumbhakarna slept.Six months the warrior slumbers lastAnd bind his torpid senses fast;But now his deep repose he breaks,The best of all our champions wakes.I captured, Ráma heart to wring,This daughter of Videha king.And brought her from that distant land(920)Where wandered many a Rákshas band.Disdainful still my love she spurns,Still from each prayer and offering turns,Yet in all lands beneath the sunNo dame may rival Sítá, none,Her dainty waist is round and slight,Her cheek like autumn moon is bright,And she like fruit in graven goldMocks her(921) whom Maya framed of old.Faultless in form, how firmly treadHer feet whose soles are rosy red!Ah, as I gaze her beauty takesMy spirit, and my passion wakes.Looking for Ráma far awayShe sought with tears a year delayNor gazing on her love-lit eyeCould I that earnest prayer deny.But baffled hopes and vain desireAt length my patient spirit tire.How shall the sons of Raghu sweepTo vengeance o\\'er the pathless deep?How shall they lead the Vánar trainAcross the monster-teeming main?One Vánar yet could find a wayTo Lanká town, and burn and slay.Take counsel then, remembering stillThat we from men need fear no ill;And give your sentence in debate,For matchless is the power of fate.Assailed by you the Gods who dwellIn heaven beneath our fury fell.And shall we fear these creatures bredIn forests, by Sugríva led?E\\'en now on ocean farther strand,The sons of Dasaratha stand,And follow, burning to attackTheir giant foes, on Sítá track.Consult then, lords for ye are wise:A seasonable plan devise.The captive lady to retain,And triumph when the foes are slain.No power can bring across the foamThose Vánars to our island home;Or if they madly will defyOur conquering might, they needs must die.\"Then Kumbhakarna anger woke,And wroth at Rávan words he spoke:\"O Monarch, when thy ravished eyesFirst looked upon thy lovely prize,Then was the time to bid us scanEach peril and mature a plan.Blest is the king who acts with heed,And ne\\'er repents one hasty deed;And hapless he whose troubled soulMourns over days beyond control.Thou hast, in beauty toils ensnared,A desperate deed of boldness dared;By fortune saved ere Ráma steelOne wound, thy mortal bane, could deal.But, Rávan, as the deed is done,The toil of war I will not shun.This arm, O rover of the night,Thy foemen to the earth shall smite,Though Indra with the Lord of Flame,The Sun and Storms, against me came.E\\'en Indra, monarch of the skies,Would dread my club and mountain size,Shrink from these teeth and quake to hearThe thunders of my voice of fear.No second dart shall Ráma cast:The first he aims shall be the last.He falls, and these dry lips shall drainThe blood of him my hand has slain;And Sítá, when her champion dies,Shall be thine undisputed prize.\"Canto XIII. Rávan Speech.But Mahápársva saw the stingOf keen reproach had galled the king;And humbly, eager to appeaseHis anger, spoke in words like these:\"And breathes there one so cold and weakThe forest and the gloom to seekWhere savage beasts abound, and spareTo taste the luscious honey there?Art thou not lord? and who is heShall venture to give laws to thee?Love thy Videhan still, and treadUpon thy prostrate foeman head.O\\'er Sítá will let thine prevail,And strength achieve if flattery fail.What though the lady yet be coyAnd turn her from the proffered joy?Soon shall her conquered heart relentAnd yield to love and blandishment.With us let Kumbhakarna fight,And Indrajít of matchless might:We need not other champions, theyShall lead us forth to rout and slay.Not ours to bribe or soothe or partThe foeman force with gentle art,Doomed, conquered by our might, to feelThe vengeance of the warrior steel.\"The Rákshas monarch heard, and movedBy flattering hopes the speech approved:\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"great chieftain, tellWhat in the olden time befell,--A secret tale which, long suppressed,Lies prisoned only in my breast.One day--a day I never forget--Fair Punjikasthalá(922) I met,When, radiant as a flame of fire,She sought the palace of the Sire.In passion eager grasp I toreFrom her sweet limbs the robes she wore,And heedless of her prayers and criesStrained to my breast the vanquised prize.Like Naliní(923) with soil distained,The mansion of the Sire she gained,And weeping made the outrage knownTo Brahmá on his heavenly throne.He in his wrath pronounced a curse,--That lord who made the universe:\"If, Rávan, thou a second timeBe guilty of so foul a crime,Thy head in shivers shall be rent:Be warned, and dread the punishment.\"Awed by the threat of vengeance stillI force not Sítá stubborn will.Terrific as the sea in might:My steps are like the Storm-Gods\\' flight;But Ráma knows not this, or heHad never sought to war with me.Where is the man would idly braveThe lion in his mountain cave,And wake him when with slumbering eyesGrim, terrible as Death, he lies?No, blinded Ráma knows me not:Ne\\'er has he seen mine arrows shot;Ne\\'er marked them speeding to their aimLike snakes with cloven tongues of flame.On him those arrows will I turn,Whose fiery points shall rend and burn.Quenched by my power when I assailThe glory of his might shall fail,As stars before the sun grow dimAnd yield their feeble light to him.\"Canto XIV. Vibhishan Speech.He ceased: Vibhishan ill at easeAddressed the king in words like these:\"O Rávan, O my lord, bewareOf Sítá dangerous as fair,Nor on thy heedless bosom hangThis serpent with a deadly fang.O King, the Maithil dame restoreTo Raghu matchless son beforeThose warriors of the woodlands, vastAs mountain peaks, approaching fast,Armed with fierce teeth and claws, encloseThy city with unsparing foes.O, be the Maithil dame restoredEre loosened from the clanging cordThe vengeful shafts of Ráma fly,And low in death thy princes lie.In all thy legions hast thou oneA match in war for Raghu son?Can Kumbhakarna self withstand,Or Indrajít, that mighty hand?In vain with Ráma wilt thou strive:Thou wilt not save thy soul aliveThough guarded by the Lord of DayAnd Storm-Gods\\' terrible array,In vain to Indra wilt thou fly,Or seek protection in the sky,In Yáma gloomy mansion dwell,Or hide thee in the depths of hell.\"He ceased; and when his lips were closedPrahasta thus his rede opposed:\"O timid heart, to counsel thus!What terrors have the Gods for us?Can snake, Gandharva, fiend appalThe giants\\' sons who scorn them all?And shall we now our birth disgrace,And dread a king of human race?\"Thus fierce Prahasta counselled ill:But sage Vibhishan constant willThe safety of the realm ensued;Who thus in turn his speech renewed:\"Yes, when a soul defiled with sinShall mount to heaven and enter in,Then, chieftain, will experience teachThe truth of thy disdainful speech.Can I, or thou, or these or allOur bravest compass Ráma fall,The chief in whom all virtues shine,The pride of old Ikshváku\\'a line,With whom the Gods may scarce compareIn skill to act, in heart to dare?Yea, idly mayst thou vaunt thee, tillSharp arrows winged with matchless skillFrom Ráma bowstring, fleet and fierceAs lightning flame, thy body pierce.Nikumbha shall not save thee then,Nor Rávan, from the lord of men.O Monarch, hear my last appeal,My counsel for thy kingdom weal.This sentence I again declare:O giant King, beware, beware!Save from the ruin that impendsThy town, thy people, and thy friends;O hear the warning urged once more:To Raghu son the dame restore.\"Canto XV. Indrajít Speech.He ceased: and Indrajít the prideOf Rákshas warriors thus replied:\"Is this a speech our king should hear,This counsel of ignoble fear?A scion of our glorious raceShould ne\\'er conceive a thought so base,But one mid all our kin we find,Vibhishan, whose degenerate mindNo spark of gallant pride retains,Whose coward soul his lineage stains.Against one giant what can twoUnhappy sons of Raghu do?Away with idle fears, away!Matched with our meanest, what are they?Beneath my conquering prowess fellThe Lord of earth and heaven and hell.(924)Through every startled region dreadOf my resistless fury spread;And Gods in each remotest sphereConfessed the universal fear.Rending the air with roar and groan,Airávat(925) to the earth was thrown.From his huge head the tusks I drew,And smote the Gods with fear anew.Shall I who tame celestials\\' pride,By whom the fiends are terrified,Now prove a weakling little worth,And fail to slay those sons of earth?\"He ceased: Vibhishan trained and triedIn war and counsel thus replied\"Thy speech is marked with scorn of truth,With rashness and the pride of youth.Yea, to thy ruin like a childThou pratest, and thy words are wild.Most dear, O Indrajít, to theeShould Rávan weal and safety be,For thou art called his son, but thouArt proved his direst foeman now,When warned by me thou hast not triedTo turn the coming woe aside.Both thee and him \\'twere meet to slay,Who brought thee to this hall to-day,And dared so rash a youth admitTo council where the wisest sit.Presumptuous, wild, devoid of sense,Filled full of pride and insolence,Thy reckless tongue thou wilt not ruleThat speaks the counsel of a fool.Who in the fight may brook or shunThe arrows shot by Raghu sonWith flame and fiery vengeance sped,Dire as his staff who rules the dead?O Rávan, let thy people live,And to the son of Raghu giveFair robes and gems and precious ore,And Sítá to his arms restore.\"Canto XVI. Rávan Speech.Then, while his breast with fury swelled,Thus Rávan spoke, as fate impelled:\"Better with foes thy dwelling make,Or house thee with the venomed snake,Than live with false familiar friendsWho further still thy foeman ends.I know their treacherous mood, I knowTheir secret triumph at thy woe.They in their inward hearts despiseThe brave, the noble, and the wise,Grieve at their bliss with rancorous hate,And for their sorrows watch and wait:Scan every fault with curious eye,And each slight error magnify.Ask elephants who roam the wildHow were their captive friends beguiled.\"For fire,\" they cry, \"we little care,For javelin and shaft and snare:Our foes are traitors, taught to bindThe trusting creatures of their kind.\"Still, still, shall blessings flow from cows,(926)And Bráhmans love their rigorous vows;Still woman change her restless will,And friends perfidious work us ill.What though with conquering feet I treadOn every prostrate foeman head;What though the worlds in abject fearTheir mighty lord in me revere?This thought my peace of mind destroysAnd robs me of expected joys.The lotus of the lake receivesThe glittering rain that gems its leaves,But each bright drop remains apart:So is it still with heart and heart.Deceitful as an autumn cloudWhich, though its thunderous voice be loud,On the dry earth no torrent sends,Such is the race of faithless friends.No riches of the bloomy sprayWill tempt the wandering bee to stayThat loves from flower to flower to range;And friends like thee are swift to change.Thou blot upon thy glorious line,If any giant tongue but thineHad dared to give this base advice,He should not live to shame me twice.\"Then just Vibhishan in the heatOf anger started from his seat,And with four captains of the bandSprang forward with his mace in hand;Then, fury flashing from his eye,Looked on the king and made reply:\"Thy rights, O Rávan, I allow:My brother and mine elder thou.Such, though from duty path they stray,We love like fathers and obey,But still too bitter to be borneIs thy harsh speech of cruel scorn.The rash like thee, who spurn control,Nor check one longing of the soul,Urged by malignant fate repelThe faithful friend who counsels well.A thousand courtiers wilt thou meet,With flattering lips of smooth deceit:But rare are they whose tongue or earWill speak the bitter truth, or hear.Unclose thy blinded eyes and seeThat snares of death encompass thee.I dread, my brother, to beholdThe shafts of Ráma, bright with gold,Flash fury through the air, and redWith fires of vengeance strike thee dead.Lord, brother, King, again reflect,Nor this mine earnest prayer reject,O, save thyself, thy royal town,Thy people and thine old renown.\"Canto XVII. Vibhishan Flight.Soon as his bitter words were said,To Raghu sons Vibhishan fled.(927)Their eyes the Vánar leaders raisedAnd on the air-borne Rákhshas gazed,Bright as a thunderbolt, in sizeLike Meru peak that cleaves the skies.In gorgeous panoply arrayedLike Indra self he stood displayed,And four attendants brave and boldShone by their chief in mail and gold.Sugríva then with dark surmiseBent on their forms his wondering eyes,And thus in hasty words confessedThe anxious doubt that moved his breast:\"Look, look ye Vánars, and beware:That giant chief sublime in airWith other four in bright arrayComes armed to conquer and to slay.\"Soon as his warning speech they heard,The Vánar chieftains undeterredSeized fragments of the rock and trees,And made reply in words like these:\"We wait thy word: the order give,And these thy foes shall cease to live.Command us, mighty King, and allLifeless upon the earth shall fall.\"Meanwhile Vibhishan with the fourStood high above the ocean shore.Sugríva and the chiefs he spied,And raised his mighty voice and cried:\"From Rávan, lord of giants, IHis brother, named Vibhishan, fly.From Janasthán he stole the childOf Janak by his art beguiled,And in his palace locked and barredSurrounds her with a Rákshas guard.I bade him, plied with varied lore,His hapless prisoner restore.But he, by Fate to ruin sent,No credence to my counsel lent,Mad as the fevered wretch who seesAnd scorns the balm to bring him ease.He scorned the sage advice I gave,He spurned me like a base-born slave.I left my children and my wife,And fly to Raghu son for life.I pray thee, Vánar chieftain, speedTo him who saves in hour of need,And tell him famed in distant landsThat suppliant here Vibhishan stands.\"The Rákshas ceased: Sugríva hiedTo Raghu noble son and cried:\"A stranger from the giant host,Borne o\\'er the sea, has reached the coast;A secret foe, he comes to slay,As owls attack their heedless prey.\\'Tis thine, O King, in time of needTo watch, to counsel, and to lead,Our Vánar legions to dispose,And guard us from our crafty foes.Vibhishan from the giants\\' isle,King Rávan brother, comes with guileAnd, feigning from his king to flee,Seeks refuge, Raghu son, with thee.Arise, O Ráma, and preventBy bold attack his dark intent.Who comes in friendly guise preparedTo slay thee by his arts ensnared.\"Thus urged Sugríva famed for loreOf moving words, and spoke no more.Then Ráma thus in turn addressedThe bold Hanúmán and the rest:\"Chiefs of the Vánar legions eachOf you heard Sugríva speech.What think ye now in time of fear,When peril and distress are near,In every doubt the wise dependFor counsel on a faithful friend.\"They heard his gracious words, and thenSpake reverent to the lord of men:\"O Raghu son, thou knowest wellAll things of heaven and earth and hell.\\'Tis but thy friendship bids us speakThe counsel Ráma need not seek.So duteous, brave, and true art thou,Heroic, faithful to thy vow.Deep in the scriptures, trained and tried,Still in thy friends wilt thou confide.Let each of us in turn impartThe secret counsel of his heart,And strive to win his chief assent,By force of wisest argument.\"They ceased and Angad thus began:\"With jealous eye the stranger scan:Not yet with trusting heart receiveVibhishan, nor his tale believe.These giants wandering far and wideTheir evil nature falsely hide,And watching with malignant skillAssail us when we fear no ill.Well ponder every hope and fearUntil thy doubtful course be clear;Then own his merit or detectHis guile, and welcome or reject.\"Then Sarabha the bold and braveIn turn his prudent sentence gave:\"Yea, Ráma, send a skilful spyWith keenest tact to test and try.Then let the stranger, as is just,Obtain or be refused thy trust.\"Then he whose heart was rich in storeOf scripture life-directing lore,King Jámbaván, stood forth and cried:\"Suspect, suspect a foe alliedWith Rávan lord of Lanká isle,And Rákshas sin and Rákshas guile.\"Then Mainda, wisest chief, who knewThe wrong, the right, the false, the true,Pondered a while, then silence broke,And thus his sober counsel spoke:\"Let one with gracious speech draw nearAnd gently charm Vibhishan ear,Till he the soothing witchery feelAnd all his secret heart reveal.So thou his aims and hopes shalt know,And hail the friend or shun the foe.\"\"Not he,\" Hanúmán cried, \"not heWho taught the Gods(928) may rival thee,Supreme in power of quickest sense,First in the art of eloquence.But hear me soothly speak, O King,And learn the hope to which I cling.Vibhishan comes no crafty spy:Urged by his brother fault to fly.With righteous soul that loathes the sin,He fled from Lanká and his kin.If strangers question, doubt will riseAnd chill the heart of one so wise.Marred by distrust the parle will end,And thou wilt lose a faithful friend.Nor let it seem so light a thingTo sound a stranger heart, O King.And he, I ween, whate\\'er he say,Will ne\\'er an evil thought betray.He comes a friend in happy time,Loathing his brother for his crime.His ear has heard thine old renown,The might that struck King Báli down,And set Sugríva on the throne.And looking now to thee aloneHe comes thy matchless aid to winAnd punish Rávan for his sin.Thus have I tried thy heart to move,And thus Vibhishan truth to prove.Still in his friendship I confide;But ponder, wisest, and decide.\"Canto XVIII. Ráma Speech.Then Ráma rising doubt was stilled,And friendly thoughts his bosom filled.Thus, deep in Scripture lore, he spake:\"The suppliant will I ne\\'er forsake,Nor my protecting aid refuseWhen one in name of friendship sues.Though faults and folly blot his fame,Pity and help he still may claim.\"He ceased: Sugríva bowed his headAnd pondered for a while, and said:\"Past number be his faults or few,What think ye of the Rákshas who,When threatening clouds of danger rise,Deserts his brother side and flies?Say, Vánars, who may hope to findTrue friendship in his faithless kind?\"The son of Raghu heard his speech:He cast a hasty look on eachOf those brave Vánar chiefs, and whileUpon his lips there played a smile,To Lakshman turned and thus expressedThe thoughts that moved his gallant breast:\"Well versed in Scripture lore, and sageAnd duly reverent to age,Is he, with long experience stored,Who counsels like this Vánar lord.Yet here, methinks, for searching eyesSome deeper, subtler matter lies.To you and all the world are knownThe perils of a monarch throne,While foe and stranger, kith and kinBy his misfortune trust to win.By hope of such advantage led,Vibhishan o\\'er the sea has fled.He in his brother stead would reign,And our alliance seeks to gain;And we his offer may embrace,A stranger and of alien race.But if he comes a spy and foe,What power has he to strike a blowIn furtherance of his close design?What is his strength compared with mine?And can I, Vánar King, forgetThe great, the universal debt,Ever to aid and welcome thoseWho pray for shelter, friends or foes?Hast thou not heard the deathless praiseWon by the dove in olden days,Who conquering his fear and hateWelcomed the slayer of his mate,And gave a banquet, to refreshThe weary fowler, of his flesh?Now hear me, Vánar King, rehearseWhat Kandu(929) spoke in ancient verse,Saint Kanva son who loved the truthAnd clave to virtue from his youth:\"Strike not the suppliant when he standsAnd asks thee with beseeching handsFor shelter: strike him not althoughHe were thy father mortal foe.No, yield him, be he proud or meek,The shelter which he comes to seek,And save thy foeman, if the deedShould cost thy life, in desperate need.\"And shall I hear the wretched cry,And my protecting aid deny?Shall I a suppliant prayer refuse,And heaven and glory basely lose?No, I will do for honour sakeE\\'en as the holy Kandu spake,Preserve a hero name from stain,And bliss in heaven and glory gain.Bound by a solemn vow I swareThat all my saving help should shareWho sought me in distress and cried,\"Thou art my hope, and none beside.\"Then go, I pray thee, Vánar King,Vibhishan to my presence bring,Yea, were he Rávan self, my vowForbids me to reject him now.\"He ceased: the Vánar king approved;And Ráma toward Vibhishan moved.So moves, a brother God to greet,Lord Indra from his heavenly seat.Canto XIX. Vibhishan Counsel.When Raghu son had owned his claimDown from the air Vibhishan came,And with his four attendants bentAt Ráma feet most reverent.\"O Ráma,\" thus he cried, \"in meVibhishan, Rávan brother see.By him disgraced thine aid I seek,Sure refuge of the poor and weak.From Lanká, friends, and wealth I fly,And reft of all on thee rely.On thee, the wretch firmest friend,My kingdom, joys, and life depend.\"With glance of favour Ráma eyedThe Rákshas chief and thus replied:\"First from thy lips I fain would hearEach brighter hope, each darker fear.Speak, stranger, that I well may knowThe strength and weakness of the foe.\"He ceased: the Rákshas chief obeyed,And thus in turn his answer made:\"O Prince, the Self-existent gaveThis boon to Rávan; he may braveAll foes in fight; no fiend or snake,Gandharva, God, his life may take.His brother Kumbhakarna viesIn might with him who rules the skies.The captain of his armies--famePerhaps has taught the warrior name--Is terrible Prahasta, whoKing Manibhadra(930) self o\\'erthrew.Where is the warrior found to faceYoung Indrajít, when armed with braceAnd guard(931) and bow he stands in mailAnd laughs at spear and arrowy hail?Within his city Lanká dwellTen million giants fierce and fell,Who wear each varied shape at willAnd eat the flesh of those they kill.These hosts against the Gods he led,And heavenly might discomfited.\"Then Ráma cried: \"I little heedGigantic strength or doughty deed.In spite of all their might has doneThe king, the captain, and the sonShall fall beneath my fury dead,And thou shalt reign in Rávan stead.He, though in depths of earth he dwell,Or seek protection down in hell,Or kneel before the Sire supreme,His forfeit life shall ne\\'er redeem.Yea, by my brothers\\' lives I swear,I will not to my home repairTill Rávan and his kith and kinHave paid in death the price of sin.\"Vibhishan bowed his head and cried:\"Thy conquering army will I guideTo storm the city of the foe,And aid the tyrant overthrow.\"Thus spake Vibhishan: Ráma pressedThe Rákshas chieftain to his breast,And cried to Lakshman: \"Haste and bringSea-water for the new-made king.\"He spoke, and o\\'er Vibhishan headThe consecrating drops were shedMid shouts that hailed with one accordThe giants\\' king and Lanká lord.\"Is there no way,\" Hanúmán cried,\"No passage o\\'er the boisterous tide?How may we lead the Vánar hostIn triumph to the farther coast?\"\"Thus,\" said Vibhishan, \"I advise:Let Raghu son in suppliant guiseEntreat the mighty Sea to lendHis succour and this cause befriend.His channels, as the wise have told,By Sagar sons were dug of old,(932)Nor will high-thoughted Ocean scornA prince of Sagar lineage born.\"He ceased; the prudent counsel wonThe glad assent of Raghu son.Then on the ocean shore a bedOf tender sacred grass was spread,Where Ráma at the close of dayLike fire upon an altar lay.Canto XX. The Spies.Sárdúla, Rávan spy, surveyedThe legions on the strand arrayed.And bore, his bosom racked with fear,These tidings to the monarch ear:\"They come, they come. A rushing tide,Ten leagues they spread from side to side,And on to storm thy city press,Fierce rovers of the wilderness.Rich in each princely power and grace,The pride of Dasaratha race,Ráma and Lakshman lead their bands,And halt them on the ocean sands.O Monarch, rise, this peril meet;Risk not the danger of defeat.First let each wiser art be tried;Bribe them, or win them, or divide.\"Such was the counsel of the spy:And Rávan called to Suka: \"Fly,Sugríva lord of Vánars seek,And thus my kingly message speak:\"Great power and might and fame are thine,Brave scion of a royal line,King Riksharajas\\' son, in theeA brother and a friend I see.How wronged by me canst thou complain?What profit here pretend to gain?If from the wood the wife I stoleOf Ráma of the prudent soul,What cause hast thou to mourn the theft?Thou art not injured or bereft.Return, O King, thy steps retraceAnd seek thy mountain dwelling-place.No, never may thy hosts withinMy Lanká walls a footing win.A mighty town whose strength defiesThe gathered armies of the skies.\"He ceased: obedient Suka heard;With wings and plumage of a birdHe rose in eager speed and throughThe air upon his errand flew.Borne o\\'er the sea with rapid wingHe stood above the Vánar king,And spoke aloud, sublime in air,The message he was charged to bear.The Vánar heard the words he spoke,And quick redoubling stroke on strokeOn head and pinions hemmed him roundAnd bore him struggling to the ground.The Rákshas wounded and distressedThese words to Raghu son addressed:\"Quick, quick! This Vánar host restrain,For heralds never must be slain.To him alone, a wretch untrue,The punishment of death is dueWho leaves his master speech unsaidAnd speaks another in its stead.\"Moved by the suppliant speech and prayerUp sprang the prince and cried, forbear.Saved from his wild assailant blowsAgain the Rákshas herald roseAnd borne on light wings to the skyAddressed Sugríva from on high:\"O Vánar Monarch, chief enduedWith power and wonderous fortitude,What answer is my king, the fearAnd scourge of weeping worlds, to hear?\"\"Go tell thy lord,\" Sugríva cried,\"Thou, Ráma foe, art thus defied.His arm the guilty Báli slew;Thus, tyrant, shalt thou perish too.Thy sons, thy friends, proud King, and allThy kith and kin with thee shall fall;And, emptied of the giant brood,Burnt Lanká be a solitude.Fly to the Sun-God pathway, goAnd hide thee deep in hell below:In vain from Ráma shalt thou fleeThough heavenly warriors fight for thee.Thine arm subdued, securely bold,The Vulture-king infirm and old:But will thy puny strength availWhen Raghu wrathful sons assail?A captive in thy palace liesThe lady of the lotus eyes:Thou knowest not how fierce and strongIs he whom thou hast dared to wrong.The best of Raghu lineage, heWhose conquering hand shall punish thee.\"He ceased: and Angad raised a cry;\"This is no herald but a spy.Above thee from his airy postHis rapid eye surveyed our host,Where with advantage he might scanOur gathered strength from rear to van.Bind him, Vánars, bind the spy,Nor let him back to Lanká fly.\"They hurled the Rákshas to the ground,They grasped his neck, his pinions bound,And firmly held him while in vainHis voice was lifted to complain.But Ráma heart inclined to spare,He listened to his plaint and prayer,And cried aloud: \"O Vánars, cease;The captive from his bonds release.\"Canto XXI. Ocean Threatened.His hands in reverence Ráma raisedAnd southward o\\'er the ocean gazed;Then on the sacred grass that madeHis lowly couch his limbs he laid.His head on that strong arm reclinedWhich Sítá, best of womankind,Had loved in happier days to holdWith soft arms decked with pearls and gold.Then rising from his bed of grass,\"This day,\" he cried, \"the host shall passTriumphant to the southern shore,Or Ocean self shall be no more.\"Thus vowing in his constant breastAgain he turned him to his rest,And there, his eyes in slumber closed,Silent beside the sea reposed.Thrice rose the Day-God thrice he set,The lord of Ocean came not yet,Thrice came the night, but Raghu sonNo answer by his service won.To Lakshman thus the hero cried,His eyes aflame with wrath and pride:\"In vain the softer gifts that graceThe good are offered to the base.Long-suffering, patience, gentle speechTheir thankless hearts can never reach.The world to him its honour paysWhose ready tongue himself can praise,Who scorns the true, and hates the right,Whose hand is ever raised to smite.Each milder art is tried in vain:It wins no glory, but disdain.And victory owns no softer charmThan might which nerves a warrior arm.My humble suit is still deniedBy Ocean overweening pride.This day the monsters of the deepIn throes of death shall wildly leap.My shafts shall rend the serpents curledIn caverns of the watery world,Disclose each sunless depth and bareThe tangled pearl and coral there.Away with mercy! at a timeLike this compassion is a crime.Welcome, the battle and the foe!My bow! my arrows and my bow!This day the Vánars\\' feet shall treadThe conquered Sea exhausted bed,And he who never feared beforeShall tremble to his farthest shore.\"Red flashed his eyes with angry glow:He stood and grasped his mighty bow,Terrific as the fire of doomWhose quenchless flames the world consume.His clanging cord the archer drew,And swift the fiery arrows flewFierce as the flashing levin sentBy him who rules the firmament.Down through the startled waters spedEach missile with its flaming head.The foamy billows rose and sank,And dashed upon the trembling bank.Sea monsters of tremendous formWith crash and roar of thunder storm.Still the wild waters rose and fellCrowned with white foam and pearl and shell.Each serpent, startled from his rest,Raised his fierce eyes and glowing crest.And prisoned Dánavs(933) where they dweltIn depths below the terror felt.Again upon his string he laidA flaming shaft, but Lakshman stayedHis arm, with gentle reasoning triedTo soothe his angry mood, and cried:\"Brother, reflect: the wise controlThe rising passions of the soul.Let Ocean grant, without thy threat,The boon on which thy heart is set.That gracious lord will ne\\'er refuseWhen Ráma son of Raghu sues.\"He ceased: and voices from the airFell clear and loud, Spare, Ráma, spare.Canto XXII. Ocean Threatened.With angry menace Ráma, bestOf Raghu sons, the Sea addressed:\"With fiery flood of arrowy rainThy channels will I dry and drain.And I and all the Vánar hostWill reach on foot the farther coast.Thou shalt not from destruction saveThe creatures of the teeming wave,And lapse of time shall ne\\'er effaceThe memory of the dire disgrace.\"Thus spoke the warrior, and preparedThe mortal shaft which never spared,Known mystic weapon, by the nameOf Brahmá, red with quenchless flame.Great terror, as he strained the bow,Struck heaven above and earth below.Through echoing skies the thunder pealed,And startled mountains rocked and reeled,The earth was black with sudden nightAnd heaven was blotted from the sight.Then ever and anon the glareOf meteors shot through murky air,And with a wild terrific soundRed lightnings struck the trembling ground.In furious gusts the fierce wind blew:Tall trees it shattered and o\\'erthrew,And, smiting with a giant stroke,Huge masses from the mountain broke.A cry of terror long and shrillCame from each valley, plain, and hill.Each ruined dale, each riven peakRe-echoed with a wail or shriek.While Raghu son undaunted gazed,The waters of the deep were raised,And, still uplifted more and more,Leapt in wild flood upon the shore.Still Ráma looked upon the tideAnd kept his post unterrified.Then from the seething flood uprearedMajestic Ocean form appeared,As rising from his eastern heightSprings through the sky the Lord of Light.Attendant on their monarch cameSea serpents with their eyes aflame.Like lazulite mid burning goldHis form was wondrous to behold.Bright with each fairest precious stoneA chain about his neck was thrown.Calm shone his lotus eyes beneathThe blossoms of his heavenly wreath,And many a pearl and sea-born gemFlashed in the monarch diadem.There Gangá, tributary queen,And Sindhu(934) by his lord, were seen,And every stream and brook renownedIn ancient story girt him round.Then, as the waters rose and swelled,The king with suppliant hands upheld,His glorious head to Ráma bentAnd thus addressed him reverent:\"Air, ether, fire, earth, water, trueTo nature will, their course pursue;And I, as ancient laws ordain,Unfordable must still remain.Yet, Raghu son, my counsel hear:I ne\\'er for love or hope or fearWill pile my waters in a heapAnd leave a pathway through the deep.Still shall my care for thee provideAn easy passage o\\'er the tide,And like a city paven streetShall be the road beneath thy feet.\"He ceased: and Ráma spoke again:\"This spell is ne\\'er invoked in vain.Where shall the magic shaft, to spendThe fury of its might, descend?\"\"Shoot,\" Ocean cried, \"thine arrow forthWith all its fury to the north,Where sacred Drumakulya lies,Whose glory with thy glory vies.There dwells a wild Abhíra(935) race,As vile in act as foul of face,Fierce Dasyus(936) who delight in ill,And drink my tributary rill.My soul no longer may endureTheir neighbourhood and touch impure.At these, O son of Raghu, aimThine arrow with the quenchless flame.\"Swift from the bow, as Ráma drewHis cord, the fiery arrow flew.Earth groaned to feel the wound, and sentA rush of water through the rent;And famed for ever is the wellOf Vrana(937) where the arrow fell.Then every brook and lake besideThroughout the region Ráma dried.But yet he gave a boon to blessAnd fertilize the wilderness:No fell disease should taint the air,And sheep and kine should prosper there:Earth should produce each pleasant root,The stately trees should bend with fruit;Oil, milk, and honey should abound,And fragrant herbs should clothe the ground.Then spake the king of brooks and seasTo Raghu son in words like these:\"Now let a wondrous task be doneBy Nala, Visvakarmá son,Who, born of one of Vánar race,Inherits by his father graceA share of his celestial art.Call Nala to perform his part,And he, divinely taught and skilled,A bridge athwart the sea shall build.\"He spoke and vanished. Nala, bestOf Vánar chiefs, the king addressed:\"O\\'er the deep sea where monsters playA bridge, O Ráma, will I lay;For, sharer of my father skill,Mine is the power and mine the will.\\'Tis vain to try each gentler artTo bribe and soothe the thankless heart;In vain on such is mercy spent;It yields to naught but punishment.Through fear alone will Ocean nowA passage o\\'er his waves allow.My mother, ere she bore her son,This boon from Visvakarmá won:\"O Mandarí, thy child shall beIn skill and glory next to me.\"But why unbidden should I fillThine ear with praises of my skill?Command the Vánar hosts to layFoundations for the bridge to-day.\"He spoke: and swift at Ráma hestUp sprang the Vánars from their rest,The mandate of the king obeyedAnd sought the forest mighty shade.Unrooted trees to earth they threw,And to the sea the timber drew.The stately palm was bowed and bent,Asokas from the ground were rent,And towering Sáls and light bamboos,And trees with flowers of varied hues,With loveliest creepers wreathed and crowned,Shook, reeled, and fell upon the ground.With mighty engines piles of stoneAnd seated hills were overthrown:Unprisoned waters sprang on high,In rain descending from the sky:And ocean with a roar and swellHeaved wildly when the mountains fell.Then the great bridge of wondrous strengthWas built, a hundred leagues in length.Rocks huge as autumn clouds bound fastWith cordage from the shore were cast,And fragments of each riven hill,And trees whose flowers adorned them still.Wild was the tumult, loud the dinAs ponderous rocks went thundering in.Ere set of sun, so toiled each crew,Ten leagues and four the structure grew;The labours of the second dayGave twenty more of ready way,And on the fifth, when sank the sun,The whole stupendous work was done.O\\'er the broad way the Vánars sped,Nor swayed it with their countless tread.Exultant on the ocean strandVibhishan stood, and, mace in hand,Longed eager for the onward way,And chafed impatient at delay.Then thus to Ráma trained and triedIn battle King Sugríva cried:\"Come, Hanumán broad back ascend;Let Angad help to Lakshman lend.These high above the sea shall bearTheir burthen through the ways of air.\"So, with Sugríva, borne o\\'erheadIkshváku sons the legions led.Behind, the Vánar hosts pursuedTheir march in endless multitude.Some skimmed the surface of the wave,To some the air a passage gave.Amid their ceaseless roar the soundOf Ocean fearful voice was drowned,As o\\'er the bridge by Nala plannedThey hastened on to Lanká strand,Where, by the pleasant brooks, mid treesLoaded with fruit, they took their ease.Canto XXIII. The Omens.Then Ráma, peerless in the skillThat marks each sign of good and ill,Strained his dear brother to his breast,And thus with prudent words addressed:\"Now, Lakshman, by the water sideIn fruitful groves the host divide,That warriors of each woodland raceMay keep their own appointed place.Dire is the danger: loss of friends,Of Vánars and of bears, impends.Distained with dust the breezes blow,And earth is shaken from below.The tall hills rock from foot to crown,And stately trees come toppling down.In threatening shape, with voice of fear,The clouds like cannibals appear,And rain in fitful torrents, redWith sanguinary drops, is shed.Long streaks of lurid light investThe evening skies from east to west.And from the sun at times a ballOf angry fire is seen to fall.From every glen and brake is heardThe boding voice of beast and bird:From den and lair night-prowlers runAnd shriek against the falling sun.Up springs the moon, but hot and redKills the sad night with woe and dread;No gentle lustre, but the gloomThat heralds universal doom.A cloud of dust and vapour marsThe beauty of the evening stars,And wild and fearful is the skyAs though the wreck of worlds were nigh.Around our heads in boding flightWheel hawk and vulture, crow and kite;And every bird of happy noteShrieks terror from his altered throat.Sword, spear and shaft shall strew the plainDyed red with torrents of the slain.To-day the Vánar troops shall closeAround the city of our foes.\"Canto XXIV. The Spy Return.As shine the heavens with autumn moonRefulgent in the height of noon,So shone with light which Ráma gaveThat army of the bold and brave,As from the sea it marched awayIn war magnificent array,And earth was shaken by the beatAnd trampling of unnumbered feet.Then to the giants\\' ears were borne,The mingled notes of drum and horn,And clash of tambours smote the sky,And shouting and the battle cry.The sound of martial strains inspiredEach chieftain, and his bosom fired:While giants from their walls replied,And answering shouts the foe defied,Then Ráma looked on Lanká whereBright banners floated in the air,And, pierced with anguish at the view,His loving thoughts to Sítá flew.\"There, prisoned by the giant, liesMy lady of the tender eyes,Like Rohiní the queen of starsO\\'erpowered by the fiery Mars.\"Then turned he to his brother chiefAnd cried in agony of grief:\"See on the hill, divinely plannedAnd built by Visvakarmá hand,The towers and domes of Lanká riseIn peerless beauty to the skies.Bright from afar the city shinesWith gleam of palaces and shrines,Like pale clouds through the region spreadBy Vishnu self inhabited.Fair gardens grow, and woods betweenThe stately domes are fresh and green,Where trees their bloom and fruit display,And sweet birds sing on every spray.Each bird is mad with joy, and beesSing labouring in the bloomy treesOn branches by the breezes bowed,Where the gay Koďl voice is loud.\"This said, he ranged with warlike artEach body of the host apart.\"There in the centre,\" Ráma cried,\"Be Angad place by Níla side.Let Rishabh of impetuous mightBe lord and leader on the right,And Gandhamádan, next in rank,Be captain of the farther flank.Lakshman and I the hosts will lead,And Jámbaván of ursine breed,With bold Sushen unused to fear,And Vegadarsí, guide the rear.\"Thus Ráma spoke: the chiefs obeyed;And all the Vánar hosts arrayedShowed awful as the autumn skyWhen clouds embattled form on high.Their arms were mighty trees o\\'erthrown,And massy blocks of mountain stone.One hope in every warlike breast,One firm resolve, they onward pressed,To die in fight or batter downThe walls and towers of Lanká town.Those marshalled legions Ráma eyed,And thus to King Sugríva cried:\"Now, Monarch, ere the hosts proceed,Let Suka, Rávan spy, be freed.\"He spoke: the Vánar gave consentAnd loosed him from imprisonment:And Suka, trembling and afraid,His homeward way to Rávan made.Loud laughed the lord of Lanká isle:\"Where hast thou stayed this weary while?Why is thy plumage marred, and whyDo twisted cords thy pinions tie?Say, comest thou in evil plightThe victim of the Vánars\\' spite?\"He ceased: the spy his fear controlled,And to the king his story told:\"I reached the ocean distant shore,Thy message to the king I bore.In sudden wrath the Vánars rose,They struck me down with furious blows;They seized me helpless on the ground,My plumage rent, my pinions bound.They would not, headlong in their ire,Consider, listen, or inquire;So fickle, wrathful, rough and rudeIs the wild forest multitude.There, marshalling the Vánar bands,King Ráma with Sugríva stands,Ráma the matchless warrior, whoVirádha and Kabandha slew,Khara, and countless giants more,And tracks his queen to Lanká shore.A bridge athwart the sea was cast,And o\\'er it have his legions passed.Hark! heralded by horns and drumsThe terrible avenger comes.E\\'en now the giants\\' isle he fillsWith warriors huge as clouds and hills,And burning with vindictive hateWill thunder soon at Lanká gate.Yield or oppose him: choose betweenThy safety and the Maithil queen.\"He ceased: the tyrant eyeballs blazedWith fury as his voice he raised:\"No, if the dwellers of the sky,Gandharvas, fiends assail me, IWill keep the Maithil lady still,Nor yield her back for fear of ill.When shall my shafts with iron hailMy foeman, Raghu son, assail,Thick as the bees with eager wingBeat on the flowery trees of spring?O, let me meet my foe at length,And strip him of his vaunted strength,Fierce as the sun who shines afarStealing the light of every star.Strong as the sea impetuous mightMy ways are like the tempest flight;But Ráma knows not this, or heIn terror from my face would flee.\"Canto XXV. Rávan Spies.(938)When Ráma and the host he ledAcross the sea had safely sped,Thus Rávan, moved by wrath and pride,To Suka and to Sáran cried:\"O counsellors, the Vánar hostHas passed the sea from coast to coast,And Dasaratha son has wroughtA wondrous deed surpassing thought.And now in truth I needs must knowThe strength and number of the foe.Go ye, to Ráma host repairAnd count me all the legions there.Learn well what power each captain leadsHis name and fame for warlike deeds.Learn by what artist wondrous aidThat bridge athwart the sea was made;Learn how the Vánar host came o\\'erAnd halted on the island shore.Mark Ráma son of Raghu well;His valour, strength, and weapons tell.Watch his advisers one by one,And Lakshman, Raghu younger son.Learn with observant eyes, and bring\"Unerring tidings to your king.He ceased: then swift in Vánar guiseForth on their errand sped the spies.They reached the Vánars, and, dismayed,Their never-ending lines surveyd:Nor would they try, in mere despair,To count the countless legions there,That crowded valley, plain and hill,That pressed about each cave and rill.Though sea-like o\\'er the land were spreadThe endless hosts which Ráma led,The bridge by thousands yet was lined,And eager myriads pressed behind.But sage Vibhishan watchful eyesHad marked the giants in disguise.He gave command the pair to seize,And told the tale in words like these:\"O Ráma these, well known erewhile,Are giant sons of Lanká isle,Two counsellors of Rávan sentTo watch the invading armament.\"Vibhishan ceased: at Ráma lookThe Rákshas envoys quailed and shook;Then suppliant hand to hand they pressedAnd thus Ikshváku son addressed:\"O Ráma, bear the truth we speak:Our monarch Rávan bade us seekThe Vánar legions and surveyTheir numbers, strength, and vast array.\"Then Ráma, friend and hope and guideOf suffering creatures, thus replied:\"Now giants, if your eyes have scannedOur armies, numbering every band,Marked lord and chief, and gazed their fill,Return to Rávan when ye will.If aught remain, if aught anewYe fain would scan with closer view,Vibhishan, ready at your call,Will lead you forth and show you all.Think not of bonds and capture; fearNo loss of life, no peril here:For, captive, helpless and unarmed,An envoy never should be harmed.Again to Lanká town repair,Speed to the giant monarch there,And be these words to Rávan told,Fierce brother of the Lord of Gold:\"Now, tyrant, tremble for thy sin:Call up thy friends, thy kith and kin,And let the power and might be seenWhich made thee bold to steal my queen.To-morrow shall thy mournful eyeBehold thy bravest warriors die,And Lanká city, tower and wall,Struck by my fiery shafts, will fall.Then shall my vengeful blow descendIts rage on thee and thine to spend,Fierce as the fiery bolt that flewFrom heaven against the Dánav crew,Mid those rebellious demons sentBy him who rules the firmament.\"Thus spake Ikshváku son, and ceased:The giants from their bonds releasedLauded the King with glad accord,And hasted homeward to their lord.Before the tyrant side by sideSuka and Sáran stood and cried:\"Vibhishan seized us, King, and fainHis helpless captives would have slain.But glorious Ráma saw us; he,Great-hearted hero, made us free.There in one spot our eyes beheldFour chiefs on earth unparalleled,Who with the guardian Gods may vieWho rule the regions of the sky.There Ráma stood, the boast and prideOf Raghu race, by Lakshman side.There stood the sage Vibhishan, thereSugríva strong beyond compare.These four alone can batter downGate, rampart, wall, and Lanká town.Nay, Ráma matchless in his form,A single foe, thy town would storm:So wondrous are his weapons, heNeeds not the succour of the three.Why speak we of the countless trainThat fills the valley, hill and plain,The millions of the Vánar breedWhom Ráma and Sugríva lead?O King, be wise, contend no more,And Sítá to her lord restore.\"Canto XXVI. The Vánar Chiefs.\"Not if the Gods in heaven who dwell,Gandharvas, and the fiends of hellIn banded opposition riseAgainst me, will I yield my prize.Still trembling from the ungentle touchOf Vánar hands ye fear too much,And bid me, heedless of the shame,Give to her lord the Maithil dame.\"Thus spoke the king in stern reproof;Then mounted to his palace roofAloft o\\'er many a story raised,And on the lands beneath him gazed.There by his faithful spies he stoodAnd looked on sea and hill and wood.There stretched before him far awayThe Vánars\\' numberless array:Scarce could the meadows\\' tender greenBeneath their trampling feet be seen.He looked a while with furious eye,Then questioned thus the nearer spy:\"Bend, Sáran, bend thy gaze, and showThe leaders of the Vánar foe.Tell me their heroes\\' names, and teachThe valour, power and might of each.\"Obedient Sáran eyed the van,The leaders marked, and thus began:\"That chief conspicuous at the headOf warriors in the forest bred,Who hither bends his ruthless eyeAnd shouts his fearful battle cry:Whose voice with pealing thunder shakesAll Lanká, with the groves and lakesAnd hills that tremble at the sound,Is Níla, for his might renowned:First of the Vánar lords controlledBy King Sugríva lofty-souled.He who his mighty arm extends,And his fierce eye on Lanká bends,In stature like a stately tower,In colour like a lotus flower,Who with his wild earth-shaking criesThee, Rávan, to the field defies,Is Angad, by Sugríva careAnointed his imperial heir:In wondrous strength, in martial firePeer of King Báli self, his sire;For Ráma sake in arms arrayedLike Varun called to Sakra aid.Behind him, girt by warlike bands,Nala the mighty Vánar stands,The son of Visvakarmá, heWho built the bridge athwart the sea.Look farther yet, O King, and markThat chieftain clothed in Sandal bark.\\'Tis Sweta, famed among his peers,A sage whom all his race reveres.See, in Sugríva ear he speaks,Then, hasting back, his post reseeks,And turns his practised eye to viewThe squadrons he has formed anew.Next Kumud stands who roamed of yoreOn Gomatí(939) delightful shore,Feared where the waving woods investHis seat on Mount Sanrochan crest.Next him a chieftain strong and dread,Comes Chanda at his legions\\' head;Exulting in his warrior mightHe hastens, burning for the fight,And boasts that his unaided powersShall cast to earth thy walls and towers.Mark, mark that chief of lion gait,Who views thee with a glance of hateAs though his very eyes would burnThe city walls to which they turn:\\'Tis Rambha, Vánar king; he dwellsIn Krishnagiri tangled dells,Where Vindhya pleasant slopes are spreadAnd fair Sudarsan lifts his head.There, listening with erected ears,Sarabha, mighty chief, appears.His soul is burning for the strife,Nor dreads the jeopardy of life.He trembles as he moves, for ire,And bends around his glance of fire.Next, like a cloud that veils the skies,A chieftain of terrific size,Conspicuous mid the Vánars, comesWith battle shout like rolling drums,\\'Tis Panas, trained in war and tried,Who dwells on Páriyátra side.He, far away, the chief who throwsA glory o\\'er the marshalled rowsThat ranged behind their captain standExulting on the ocean strand,Is Vinata the fierce in fight,Preëminent like Dardur height.That chieftain bending down to drinkOn lovely Vená verdant brink,Is Krathan; now he lifts his eyesAnd thee to mortal fray defies.Next Gavaya comes, whose haughty mindScorns all the warriors of his kind.He comes to trample--such his boast--On Lanká with his single host.\"Canto XXVII. The Vánar Chiefs.\"Yet more remain, brave chiefs who stakeTheir noble lives for Ráma sake.See, glorious, golden-coated, oneWho glisters like the morning sun,Whom thousands of his race surround,\\'Tis Hara for his strength renowned.Next comes a mighty chieftain, heWhose legions, armed with rock and tree,Press on, in numbers passing tale,The ramparts of our town to scale.O Rávan, see the king advanceTerrific with his fiery glance,Girt by the bravest of his train,Majestic as the God of Rain,Parjanya, when his host of cloudsAbout the king, embattled, crowds:On Rikshaván high mountain nursed,In Narmadá(940) he slakes his thirst,Dhúmra, proud ursine chief, who leadsWild warriors whom the forest breeds.His brother, next in strength and age,In Jámbaván the famous sage.Of yore his might and skill he lentTo him who rules the firmament,And Indra liberal boons repaidThe chieftain for the timely aid.There like a gloomy cloud that fliesBorne by the tempest through the skies,Pramáthí stands: he roamed of yoreThe forest wilds on Gangá shore,Where elephants were struck with dreadAnd trembling at his coming fled.There on his foes he loved to sateThe old hereditary hate.(941)Look, Gaja and Gaváksha showTheir lust of battle with the foe.See Nala burning for the fray,And Níla chafing at delay.Behind the eager captains pressWild hosts in numbers numberless,And each for Ráma sake would fallOr force his way through Lanká wall.\"Canto XXVIII. The Chieftains.There Sáran ceased: then Suka brokeThe silence and to Rávan spoke:\"O Monarch, yonder chiefs survey:Like elephants in size are they,And tower like stately trees that growWhere Gangá nursing waters flow;Yea, tall as mountain pines that flingLong shadows o\\'er the snow-crowned king.They all in wild Kishkindhá dwellAnd serve their lord Sugríva well.The Gods\\' and bright Gandharvas\\' seed,They take each form that suits their need.Now farther look, O Monarch, whereThose chieftains stand, a glorious pair,Conspicuous for their godlike frames;Dwivid and Mainda are their names.Their lips the drink of heaven have known,And Brahmá claims them for his own.That chieftain whom thine eyes beholdRefulgent like a hill of gold,Before whose wrathful might the seaRoused from his rest would turn and flee,The peerless Vánar, he who cameTo Lanká for the Maithil dame,The Wind-God son Hanumán; thouHast seen him once, behold him now.Still nearer let thy glance be bent,And mark that prince preëminentMid chieftains for his strength and sizeAnd splendour of his lotus eyes.Far through the worlds his virtues shine,The glory of Ikshváku line.The path of truth he never leaves,And still through all to duty cleaves.Deep in the Vedas, skilled to wieldThe mystic shafts to him revealed:Whose flaming darts to heaven ascend,And through the earth a passage rend:In might like him who rules the sky;Like Yáma, when his wrath grows high:Whose queen, the darling of his soul,Thy magic art deceived and stole:There royal Ráma stands and longsFor battle to avenge his wrongs.Near on his right a prince, in hueLike pure gold freshly burnished, view:Broad is his chest, his eye is red,His black hair curls about his head:\\'Tis Lakshman, faithful friend, who sharesHis brother joys, his brother cares.By Ráma side he loves to standAnd serve him as his better hand,For whose dear sake without a sighThe warrior youth would gladly die.On Ráma left Vibhishan view,With giants for his retinue:King-making drops have dewed his head,Appointed monarch in thy stead.Behold that chieftain sternly still,High towering like a rooted hill,Supreme in power and pride of place,The monarch of the Vánar race.Raised high above his woodland kind,In might and glory, frame and mind,His head above his host he showsConspicuous as the Lord of Snows.His home is far from hostile eyesWhere deep in woods Kishkindhá lies.A glistering chain which flowers bedeckWith burnished gold adorns his neck.Queen Fortune, loved by Gods and kings,To him her chosen favourite clings.That chain he owes to Ráma grace,And Tárá and his kingly place.In him the great Sugríva know,Whom Ráma rescued from his foe.\"(942)Canto XXIX. Sárdúla Captured.The giant viewed with earnest kenThe Vánars and the lords of men;Then thus, with grief and anger moved,In bitter tone the spies reproved:\"Can faithful servants hope to pleaseTheir master with such fates as these?Or hope ye with wild words to wringThe bosom of your lord and king?Such words were better said by thoseWho come arrayed our mortal foes.In vain your ears have heard the sage,And listened to the lore of age,Untaught, though lectured many a day,The first great lesson, to obey,\\'Tis marvel Rávan reigns and rulesWhose counsellors are blind and fools.Has death no terrors that ye dareTo tempt your monarch to despair,From whose imperial mandate flowDisgrace and honour, weal and woe?Yea, forest trees, when flames are fannedAbout their scorching trunks, may stand;But naught can set the sinner freeWhen kings the punishment decree.I would not in mine anger spareThe traitorous foe-praising pair,But years of faithful service pleadFor pardon, and they shall not bleed.Henceforth to me be dead: depart,Far from my presence and my heart.\"Thus spoke the angry king: the twoCried, Long live Rávan, and withdrew,The giant monarch turned and criedTo strong Mahodar at his side:\"Go thou, and spies more faithful bring.More duteous to their lord the king.\"Swift at his word Mahodar shed,And came returning at the headOf long tried messengers, who bentBefore their monarch reverent.\"Go quickly hence,\" said Rávan \"scanWith keenest eyes the foeman plan.Learn who, as nearest friends, adviseAnd mould each secret enterprise.Learn when he wakes and goes to rest,Sound every purpose of his breast.Learn what the prince intends to-day:Watch keenly all, and come away.\"With joy they heard the words he said:Then with Sárdúla at their headAbout the giant king they wentWith circling paces reverent.By fair Suvela grassy sideThe chiefs of Raghu race they spied,Where, shaded by the waving wood,Vibhishan and Sugríva stood.A while they rested there and viewedThe Vánars\\' countless multitude.Vibhishan with observant eyesKnew at a glance the giant spies,And bade the warriors of his trainBind the rash foes with cord and chain:\"Sárdúla is the sin,\" he cried.He neath the Vánars\\' hands had died,But Ráma from their fury freedThe captive in his utmost need,And, merciful at sight of woe,Loosed all the spies and bade them go.Then home to Lanká monarch fledThe giant chiefs discomfited.Canto XXX. Sárdúla Speech.They told their lord that Ráma stillLay waiting by Suvela hill.The tyrant, flushed with angry glow,Heard of the coming of the foe,And thus with close inquiry pressedSárdúla spokesman for the rest:\"Why art thou sad, night-rover? speak:Has grief or terror changed thy cheek?Have the wild Vánars\\' hostile bandsAssailed thee with their mighty hands?\"Sárdúla heard, but scarce might speak;His trembling tones were faint and weak:\"O Giant King, in vain we tryThe purpose of the foe to spy.Their strength and number none may tell,And Ráma guards his legions well.He leaves no hope to prying eyes,And parley with the chiefs denies:Each road and path a Vánar guard,Of mountain size, has closed and barred.Soon as my feet an entrance foundBy giants was I seized and bound,And wounded sore I fell beneathTheir fists and knees and hands and teeth.Then trembling, bleeding, wellnigh deadTo Ráma presence was I led.He in his mercy stooped to save,And freedom to the captive gave.With rocks and shattered mountains heHas bridged his way athwart the sea,And he and all his legions waitEmbattled close to Lanká gate.Soon will the host thy wall assail,And, swarming on, the rampart scale.Now, O my King, his consort yield,Or arm thee with the sword and shield.This choice is left thee: choose betweenThy safety and the Maithil queen.\"(943)Canto XXXI. The Magic Head.The tyrant troubled eye confessedThe secret fear that filled his breast.With dread of coming woe dismayedHe called his counsellors to aid;Then sternly silent, deep in thought,His chamber in the palace sought.Then, as the surest hope of all,The monarch bade his servants callVidyujjihva, whom magic skillMade master of the means of ill.Then spake the lord of Lanká isle:\"Come, Sítá with thine arts beguile.With magic skill and deftest careA head like Ráma own prepare.This head, long shafts and mighty bow,To Janak daughter will we show.\"He ceased: Vidyujjihva obeyed,And wondrous magic skill displayed;And Rávan for the art he showedAn ornament of price bestowed.Then to the grove where Sítá layThe lord of Lanká took his way.Pale, wasted, weeping, on the groundThe melancholy queen he found,Whose thoughts in utmost stress of illWere fixed upon her husband still.The giant king approached the dame,Declared in tones of joy his name;Then heeding naught her wild distressBespake her, stern and pitiless:\"The prince to whom thy fancies clingThough loved and wooed by Lanká king,Who slew the noble Khara,--heIs slain by warriors sent by me.Thy living root is hewn away,Thy scornful pride is tamed to-day.Thy lord in battle front has died,And Sítá shall be Rávan bride.Hence, idle thoughts: thy hope is fled;What wilt thou, Sítá, with the dead?Rise, child of Janak, rise and beThe queen of all my queens and me.Incline thine ear, and I will tell,Dear lady, how thy husband fell.He bridged his way across the seaWith countless troops to fight with me.The setting sun had flushed the westWhen on the shore they took their rest.Weary with toil no watch they kept,Securely on the sands they slept.Prahasta troops assailed our foes,And smote them in their deep repose.Scarce could their bravest prove their might:They perished in the dark of night.Axe, spear, and sword, directed well,Upon the sleeping myriads fell.First in the fight Prahasta swordReft of his head thy slumbering lord.Roused at the din Vibhishan rose,The captive of surrounding foes,And Lakshman through the woods that spreadAround him with his Vánars fled.Hanúmán fell: one deadly strokeThe neck of King Sugríva broke,And Mainda sank, and Dwivid layGasping in blood his life away.The Vánars died, or fled dispersedLike cloudlets when the storm has burst.Some rose aloft in air, and moreRan to the sea and filled the shore.On shore, in woods, on hill and plainOur conquering giants left the slain.Thus my victorious host o\\'erthrewThe Vánars, and thy husband slew:See, rudely stained with dust, and redWith dropping blood, the severed head.\"Then, turning to a Rákshas slave,The ruthless king his mandate gave,And straight Vidyujjihva who boreThe head still wet with dripping gore,The arrows and the mighty bow,Bent down before his master low.\"Vidyujjihva,\" cried Rávan, \"placeThe head before the lady face,And let her see with weeping eyesThat low in death her husband lies.\"Before the queen the giant laidThe beauteous head his art had made.And Rávan cried: \"Thine eyes will knowThese arrows and the mighty bow.With fame of this by Ráma strungThe earth and heaven and hell have rung.Prahasta brought it hither whenHis hand had slain thy prince of men.Now, widowed Queen, thy hopes resign:Forget thy husband and be mine.\"Canto XXXII. Sítá Lament.Again her eyes with tears o\\'erflowed:She gazed upon the head he showed,Gazed on the bow so famed of yore,The glorious bow which Ráma bore.She gazed upon his cheek and brows,The eyes of her beloved spouse;His lips, the lustre of his hair,The priceless gem that glittered there.The features of her lord she knew,And, pierced with anguish at the view,She lifted up her voice and cried:\"Kaikeyí, art thou satisfied?Now all thy longings are fulfilled;The joy of Raghu race is killed,And ruined is the ancient line,Destroyer, by that fraud of thine.Ah, what offence, O cruel dame,What fault in Ráma couldst thou blame,To drive him clad in hermit dressWith Sítá to the wilderness?\"Great trembling seized her frame, and sheFell like a stricken plantain tree.As lie the dead she lay; at lengthSlowly regaining sense and strength,On the dear head she fixed her eyeAnd cried with very bitter cry:\"Ah, when thy cold dead cheek I view,My hero, I am murdered too.Then first a faithful woman eyesSee sorrow, when her husband dies.When thou, my lord, wast nigh to save,Some stealthy hand thy death wound gave.Thou art not dead: rise, hero, rise;Long life was thine, as spake the wiseWhose words, I ween, are ever true,For faith lies open to their view.Ah lord, and shall thy head reclineOn earth cold breast, forsaking mine,Counting her chill lap dearer farThan I and my caresses are?Ah, is it thus these eyes beholdThy famous bow adorned with gold,Whereon of yore I loved to bindSweet garlands that my hands had twined?And hast thou sought in heaven a placeAmid the founders of thy race,Where in the home deserved so wellThy sires and Dasaratha dwell?Or dost thou shine a brighter starIn skies where blest immortals are,Forsaking in thy lofty scornThe race wherein thy sires were born?Turn to my gaze, O turn thine eye:Why are thy cold lips silent, why?When first we met as youth and maid,When in thy hand my hand was laid,Thy promise was thy steps should beThrough life in duty path with me.Remember, faithful still, thy vow,And take me with thee even now.Is that broad bosom where I hung,That neck to which I fondly clung,Where flowery garlands breathed their scentBy hungry dogs and vultures rent?Shall no funereal honours graceThe parted lord of Raghu race,Whose bounty liberal fees bestowed,For whom the fires of worship glowed?Kausalyá wild with grief will seeOne sole survivor of the threeWho in their hermit garments wentTo the dark woods in banishment.Then at her cry shall Lakshman tellHow, slain by night, the Vánars fell;How to thy side the giants crept,And slew the hero as he slept.Thy fate and mine the queen will know,And broken-hearted die of woe.For my unworthy sake, for mine,Ráma, the glory of his line,Who bridged his way across the main,Is basely in a puddle slain;And I, the graceless wife he wed,Have brought this ruin on his head.Me, too, on him, O Rávan, slay:The wife beside her husband lay.By his dear body let me rest,Cheek close to cheek and breast to breast,My happy eyes I then will close,And follow whither Ráma goes.\"Thus cried the miserable dame;When to the king a warder came,Before the giant monarch bowedAnd said that, followed by a crowdOf counsellors and lords of state,Prahasta stood before the gate,And, sent by some engrossing care,Craved audience of his master there.The anxious tyrant left his seatAnd hastened forth the chief to meet:Then summoning his nobles all,Took counsel in his regal hall.When Lanká lord had left the queen,The head and bow no more were seen.The giant king his nobles eyed,And, terrible as Yáma, cried:\"O faithful lords, the time is come:Gather our hosts with beat of drum.Nigh to the town our foeman draws:Be prudent, nor reveal the cause.\"The nobles listened and obeyed:Swift were the gathered troops arrayed,And countless rovers of the nightStood burning for the hour of fight.Canto XXXIII. Saramá.But Saramá, of gentler mood,With pitying eyes the mourner viewed,Stole to her side and softly toldGlad tidings that her heart consoled,Revealing with sweet voice and smileThe secret of the giant guile.She, one of those who night and dayWatching in turns by Sítá lay,Though Rákshas born felt pity touch,And loved the hapless lady much.\"I heard,\" she said, \"thy bitter cry,Heard Rávan speech and thy reply,For, hiding in the thicket near,No word or tone escaped mine ear.When Rávan hastened forth I bentMy steps to follow as he went,And learnt the secret cause that droveThe monarch from the Asoka grove.Believe me, Queen, thou needst not weepFor Ráma slaughtered in his sleep.Thy lion lord of men defiesBy day attack, by night surprise.Can even giants slay with easeVast hosts who fight with brandished trees,For whom, with eye that never sleeps,His constant watch thy Ráma keeps?Lord of the mighty arm and chest,Of earthly warriors first and best,Whose fame through all the regions rings,Proud scion of a hundred kings;Who guards his life and loves to lendHis saving succour to a friend:Whose bow no hand but his can strain,--Thy lord, thy Ráma is not slain.Obedient to his master will,A great magician, trained in ill,With deftest art surpassing thoughtThat marvellous illusion wrought.Let rising hope thy grief dispel:Look up and smile, for all is well,And gentle Lakshmí, Fortune Queen,Regards thee with a favouring mien.Thy Ráma with his Vánar trainHas thrown a bridge athwart the main,Has led his countless legions o\\'er,And ranged them on this southern shore.These eyes have seen the hero standGirt by his hosts on Lanká strand,And breathless spies each moment bringFresh tidings to the giant king;And every peer and lord of stateIs called to counsel and debate.\"She ceased: the sound, long loud and clear,Of gathering armies smote her ear,Where call of drum and shell rang out,The tambour and the battle shout;And, while the din the echoes woke,Again to Janak child she spoke:\"Hear, lady, hear the loud alarmsThat call the Rákshas troops to arms,From stable and from stall they leadThe elephant and neighing steed,Brace harness on with deftest care,And chariots for the fight prepare.Swift o\\'er the trembling ground careerMailed horsemen armed with axe and spear,And here and there in road and streetThe terrible battalions meet.I hear the gathering near and far,The snorting steed, the rattling car.Bold chieftains, leaders of the brave,Press densely on, like wave on wave,And bright the evening sunbeams glanceOn helm and shield, on sword and lance.Hark, lady, to the ringing steel,Hark to the rolling chariot wheel:Hark to the mettled courser neighAnd drums\\' loud thunder far away.The Queen of Fortune holds thee dear,For Lanká troops are struck with fear,And Ráma with the lotus eyes,Like Indra monarch of the skies,With conquering arm will slay his foeAnd free his lady from her woe.Soon will his breast support thy head,And tears of joy thine eyes will shed.Soon by his mighty arm embracedThe long-lost rapture wilt thou taste,And Ráma, meet for highest bliss,Will gain his guerdon in thy kiss.\"Canto XXXIV. Saramá Tidings.Thus Saramá her story told:And Sítá spirit was consoled,As when the first fresh rain is shedThe parching earth is comforted.Then, filled with zeal for Sítá sake,Again in gentle tones she spake,And, skilled in arts that soothe and please,Addressed the queen in words like these:\"Thy husband, lady, will I seek,Say the fond words thy lips would speak,And then, unseen of any eye,Back to thy side will swiftly fly.My airy flights are speedier farThan Garuda and the tempest are.\"Then Sítá spake: her former woeStill left her accents faint and low:\"I know thy steps, which naught can stay,Can urge through heaven and hell their way.Then if thy love and changeless willWould serve the helpless captive still,Go forth and learn each plot and guilePlanned by the lord of Lanká isle.With magic art like maddening wineHe cheats these weeping eyes of mine,Torments me with his suit, nor sparesReproof or flattery, threats or prayers.These guards surround me night and day;My heart is sad, my senses stray;And helpless in my woe I fearThe tyrant Rávan even here.\"Then Saramá replied: \"I goTo learn the purpose of thy foe,Soon by thy side again to standAnd tell thee what the king has planned.\"She sped, she heard with eager earsThe tyrant speak his hopes and fears,Where, gathered at their master call,The nobles filled the council hall;Then swiftly, to her promise true,Back to the Asoka grove she flew.The lady on the grassy ground,Longing for her return, she found;Who with a gentle smile, to greetThe envoy, led her to a seat.Through her worn frame a shiver ranAs Saramá her tale began:\"There stood the royal mother: sheBesought her son to set thee free,And to her counsel, tears and prayers,The elder nobles added theirs:\"O be the Maithil queen restoredWith honour to her angry lord,Let Janasthán unhappy fightBe witness of the hero might.Hanúmán o\\'er the waters cameAnd looked upon the guarded dame.Let Lanká chiefs who fought and fellThe prowess of the leader tell.\"In vain they sued, in vain she wept,His purpose still unchanged he kept,As clings the miser to his gold,He would not loose thee from his hold.No, never till in death he lies,Will Lanká lord release his prize.Soon slain by Ráma arrows allThe giants with their king will fall,And Ráma to his home will leadHis black-eyed queen from bondage freed.\"An awful sound that moment roseFrom Lanká fast-approaching foes,Where drum and shell in mingled pealMade earth in terror rock and reel.The hosts within the walls arrayedStood trembling, in their hearts dismayed;Thought of the tempest soon to burst,And Lanká lord, their ruin, cursed.Canto XXXV. Malyaván Speech.The fearful notes of drum and shellUpon the ear of Rávan fell.One moment quailed his haughty look,One moment in his fear he shook,But soon recalling wonted pride,His counsellors he sternly eyed,And with a voice that thundered throughThe council hall began anew:\"Lords, I have heard--your tongues have told--How Raghu son is fierce and bold.To Lanká shore has bridged his wayAnd hither leads his wild array.I know your might, in battle tried,Fighting and conquering by my side.Why now, when such a foe is near,Looks eye to eye in silent fear?\"He ceased, his mother sire well knownFor wisdom in the council shown,Malyaván, sage and faithful guide.Thus to the monarch speech replied:\"Long reigns the king in safe repose,Unmoved by fear of vanquished foes,Whose feet by saving knowledge ledIn justice path delight to tread:Who knows to sheath the sword or wield,To order peace, to strike or yield:Prefers, when foes are stronger, peace,And bids a doubtful conflict cease.Now, King, the choice before thee lies,Make peace with Ráma, and be wise.This day the captive queen restoreWho brings the foe to Lanká shore.The Sire by whom the worlds are swayedOf yore the Gods and demons made.With these Injustice sided; thoseFair Justice for her champions chose.Still Justice dwells with Gods above;Injustice, fiends and giants love.Thou, through the worlds that fear thee, longHast scorned the right and loved the wrong,And Justice, with thy foes allied,Gives might resistless to their side.Thou, guided by thy wicked will,Hast found delight in deeds of ill,And sages in their holy restHave trembled, by thy power oppressed.But they, who check each vain desire,Are clothed with might which burns like fire.In them the power and glory liveWhich zeal and saintly fervour give.Their constant task, their sole delightIs worship and each holy rite,To chant aloud the Veda hymn,Nor let the sacred fires grow dim.Now through the air like thunder ringThe echoes of the chants they sing.The vapours of their incense riseAnd veil with cloudy pall the skies,And Rákshas might grows weak and faintKilled by the power of sage and saint.By Brahmá boon thy life was screenedFrom God, Gandharva, Yaksha, fiend;But Vánars, men, and bears, arrayedAgainst thee now, thy shores invade.Red meteors, heralds of despairFlash frequent through the lurid air,Foretelling to my troubled mindThe ruin of the Rákshas kind.With awful thundering overheadClouds black as night are densely spread,And oozing from the gloomy pallGreat drops of blood on Lanká fall.Dogs roam through house and shrine to stealThe sacred oil and curd and meal,Cats pair with tigers, hounds with swine,And asses\\' foals are born of kine.In these and countless signs I traceThe ruin of the giant race.\\'Tis Vishnu self who comes to stormThy city, clothed in Ráma form;For, well I ween, no mortal handThe ocean with a bridge has spanned.O giant King, the dame release,And sue to Raghu son for peace\"Canto XXXVI. Rávan Reply.But Rávan breast with fury swelled,And thus he spake by Death impelled,While, under brows in anger bent,Fierce glances from his eyes were sent:\"The bitter words which thou, misledBy friendly thought, hast fondly said,Which praise the foe and counsel fear,Unheeded fall upon mine ear.How canst thou deem a mighty foeThis Ráma who, in stress of woe,Seeks, banished as his sire decreed,Assistance from the Vánar breed?Am I so feeble in thine eyes,Though feared by dwellers of the skies,--Whose might in many a battle shownThe glorious race of giants own?Shall I for fear of him restoreThe lady whom I hither bore,Exceeding fair like Beauty Queen(944)Without her well-loved lotus seen?Around the chief let Lakshman stand,Sugríva, and each Vánar band,Soon, Malyaván, thine eyes will seeThis boasted Ráma slain by me.I in the brunt of war defyThe mightiest warriors of the sky;And if I stoop to combat men,Shall I be weak and tremble then?This mangled trunk the foe may rend,But Rávan ne\\'er can yield or bend,And be it vice or virtue, IThis nature never will belie.What marvel if he bridged the sea?Why should this deed disquiet thee?This, only this, I surely know,Back with his life he shall not go.\"Thus in loud tones the king exclaimed,And mute stood Malyaván ashamed,His reverend head he humbly bent,And slowly to his mansion went.But Rávan stayed, and deep in careHeld counsel with his nobles there,All entrance to secure and close,And guard the city from their foes.He bade the chief Prahasta wait,Commander at the eastern gate,To fierce Mahodar, strong and brave,To keep the southern gate, he gave,Where Mahápársva might should aidThe chieftain with his hosts arrayed.To guard the west--no chief more fit--He placed the warrior Indrajít,His son, the giant joy and boast,Surrounded by a Rákshas host:And mighty Sáran hastened forthWith Suka to protect the north.(945)\"I will myself,\" the monarch cried,\"Be present on the northern side.\"These orders for the walls\\' defenceThe tyrant gave, then parted thence,And, by the hope of victory fired,To chambers far within, retired.Canto XXXVII. Preparations.Lords of the legions of the wood,The chieftains with Vibhishan stood,And, strangers in the foeman land,Their hopes and fears in council scanned:\"See, see where Lanká towers ascend,Which Rávan power and might defend,Which Gods, Gandharvas, fiends would failTo conquer, if they durst assail.How shall our legions pass within,The city of the foe to win,With massive walls and portals barredWhich Rávan keeps with surest guard?\"With anxious looks the walls they eyed:And sage Vibhishan thus replied:\"These lords of mine(946) can answer: theyWithin the walls have found their way,The foeman plan and order learned,And hither to my side returned.Now, Ráma, let my tongue declareHow Rávan hosts are stationed there.Prahasta heads, in warlike state,His legions at the eastern gate.To guard the southern portal standsMahodar, girt by Rákshas bands,Where mighty Mahápársva, sentBy Rávan hest, his aid has lent.Guard of the gate that fronts the westIs valiant Indrajít, the bestOf warriors, Rávan joy and pride;And by the youthful chieftain sideAre giants, armed for fierce attacksWith sword and mace and battle-axe.North, where approach is dreaded most,The king, encompassed with a hostOf giants trained in war, whose handsWield maces, swords and lances, stands.All these are chiefs whom Rávan choseAs mightiest to resist his foes;And each a countless army(947) leadsWith elephants and cars and steeds.\"Then Ráma, while his spirit burnedFor battle, words like these returned:\"The eastern gate be Níla care,Opponent of Prahasta there.The southern gate, with troops arrayedLet Angad, Báli son, invade.The gate that fronts the falling sunShall be by brave Hanúmán won;Soon through its portals shall he leadHis myriads of Vánar breed.The gate that fronts the north shall beAssailed by Lakshman and by me,For I myself have sworn to killThe tyrant who delights in ill.Armed with the boon which Brahmá gave,The Gods of heaven he loves to brave,And through the trembling worlds he flies,Oppressor of the just and wise.Thou, Jámbaván, and thou, O KingOf Vánars, all your bravest bring,And with your hosts in dense arrayStraight to the centre force your way.But let no Vánar in the stormDisguise him in a human form,Ye chiefs who change your shapes at will,Retain your Vánar semblance still.Thus, when we battle with the foe,Both men and Vánars will ye know,In human form will seven appear;Myself, my brother Lakshman here;Vibhishan, and the four he ledFrom Lanká city when he fled.\"Thus Raghu son the chiefs addressed:Then, gazing on Suvela crest,Transported by the lovely sight,He longed to climb the mountain height.Canto XXXVIII. The Ascent Of Suvela.\"Come let us scale,\" the hero cried,\"This hill with various metals dyed.This night upon the breezy crestSugríva, Lakshman, I, will rest,With sage Vibhishan, faithful friend,His counsel and his lore to lend.From those tall peaks each eager eyeThe foeman city shall espy,Who from the wood my darling stoleAnd brought long anguish on my soul.\"Thus spake the lord of men, and bentHis footsteps to the steep ascent,And Lakshman, true in weal and woe,Next followed with his shafts and bow.Vibhishan followed, next in place,The sovereign of the Vánar race,And hundreds of the forest kindThronged with impetuous feet, behind.The chiefs in woods and mountains bredFast followed to Suvela head,And gazed on Lanká bright and fairAs some gay city in the air.On glittering gates, on ramparts raisedBy giant hands, the chieftains gazed.They saw the mighty hosts that, skilledIn arts of war, the city filled,And ramparts with new ramparts lined,The swarthy hosts that stood behind.With spirits burning for the fightThey saw the giants from the height,And from a hundred throats rang outDefiance and the battle shout.Then sank the sun with dying flame,And soft the shades of twilight came,And the full moon delicious lightWas shed upon the tranquil night.Canto XXXIX. Lanká.They slept secure: the sun aroseAnd called the chieftains from repose.Before the wondering Vánars, gayWith grove and garden, Lanká lay,Where golden buds the Champak showed,And bright with bloom Asoka glowed,And palm and Sál and many a treeWith leaf and flower were fair to see.They looked on wood and lawn and glade,On emerald grass and dusky shade,Where creepers filled the air with scent,And luscious fruit the branches bent,Where bees inebriate loved to throng,And each sweet bird was loud in song.The wondering Vánars passed the boundThat circled that enchanting ground,And as they came a sweet breeze throughThe odorous alleys softly blew.Some Vánars, at their king behest,Onward to bannered Lanká pressed,While, startled by the strangers\\' tread,The birds and deer before them fled.Earth trembled at each step they took,And Lanká at their shouting shook.Bright rose before their wondering eyesTrikúta peak that kissed the skies,And, clothed with flowers of every hue,Afar its golden radiance threw.Most fair to see the mountain headA hundred leagues in length was spread.There Rávan town, securely placed,The summit of Trikúta graced.O\\'er leagues of land she stretched in pride,A hundred long and twenty wide.They saw a lofty wall enfoldThe city, built of blocks of gold,They saw the beams of morning fallOn dome and fane within the wall,Bright with the shine that mansion givesWhere Vishnu in his glory lives.White-crested like the Lord of SnowsBefore them Rávan palace rose.High on a thousand pillars raisedWith gold and precious stone it blazed,Guarded by giant warders, crownAnd ornament of Lanká town.Canto XL. Rávan Attacked.Still stood the son of Raghu whereSuvela peak rose high in air,And with Sugríva turned his eyeTo scan each quarter of the sky.There on Trikúta, nobly plannedAnd built by Visvakarmá hand,He saw the lovely Lanká, dressedIn all her varied beauty, rest.High on a tower above the gateThe tyrant stood in kingly state.The royal canopy displayedAbove him lent its grateful shade,And servants, from the giant band,His cheek with jewelled chowries fanned.Red sandal o\\'er his breast was spread,His ornaments and robe were red:Thus shows a cloud of darksome hueWith golden sunbeams flashing through.While Ráma and the chiefs intentUpon the king their glances bent,Up sprang Sugríva from the groundAnd reached the turret at a bound.Unterrified the Vánar stood,And wroth, with wondrous hardihood,The king in bitter words addressed,And thus his scorn and hate expressed:\"King of the giant race, in meThe friend and slave of Ráma see.Lord of the world, he gives me powerTo smite thee in thy fenced tower.\"While through the air his challenge rang,At Rávan face the Vánar sprang.Snatched from his head the kingly crownAnd dashed it in his fury down.Straight at his foe the giant flew,His mighty arms about him threw.With strength resistless swung him roundAnd dashed him panting to the ground.Unharmed amid the storm of blowsSwift to his feet Sugríva rose.Again in furious fight they met:With streams of blood their limbs were wet,Each grasping his opponent waist.Thus with their branches interlaced,Which, crimson with the flowers of spring,From side to side the breezes swing,In furious wrestle you may seeThe Kinsuk and the Seemal tree.(948)They fought with fists and hands, alikePrepared to parry and to strike.Long time the doubtful combat, wagedWith matchless strength and fury, raged.Each fiercely struck, each guarded well,Till, closing, from the tower they fell,And, grasping each the other throat,Lay for an instant in the moat.They rose, and each in fiercer moodThe sanguinary strife renewed.Well matched in size and strength and skillThey fought the dubious battle still.While sweat and blood their limbs bedewedThey met, retreated, and pursued:Each stratagem and art they tried,Stood front to front and swerved aside.His hand a while the giant stayedAnd called his magic to his aid.But brave Sugríva, swift to knowThe guileful purpose of the foe,Gained with light leap the upper air,And breath and strength and spirit there;Then, joyous as for victory won,Returned to Raghu royal son.Canto XLI. Ráma Envoy.When Ráma saw each bloody traceOn King Sugríva limbs and face,He cried, while, sorrowing at the view,His arms about his friend he threw:\"Too venturous chieftain, kings like usBring not their lives in peril thus;Nor, save when counsel shows the need,Attempt so bold, so rash a deed.Remember, I, Vibhishan allHave sorrowed fearing for thy fall.O do not--for us all I speak--These desperate adventures seek.\"\"I could not,\" cried Sugríva, \"brookUpon the giant king to look,Nor challenge to the deadly strifeThe fiend who robbed thee of thy wife.\"\"Now Lakshman, marshal,\" Ráma cried,\"Our legions where the woods are wide,And stand we ready to opposeThe fury of our giant foes.This day our armies shall ascendThe walls which Rávan powers defend,And floods of Rákshas blood shall stainThe streets encumbered with the slain.\"Down from the peak he came, and viewedThe Vánars\\' ordered multitude.Each captain there for battle burned,Each fiery eye to Lanká turned.On, where the royal brothers ledTo Lanká walls the legions sped.The northern gate, where giant foesSwarmed round their monarch, Ráma choseWhere he in person might directThe battle, and his troops protect.What arm but his the post might keepWhere, strong as he who sways the deep,(949)Mid thousands armed with bow and mace,Stood Rávan mightiest of his race?The eastern gate was Níla post,Where marshalled stood his Vánar host,And Mainda with his troops arrayed,And Dwivid stood to lend him aid.The southern gate was Angad care,Who ranged his bold battalions there.Hanúmán by the port that facedThe setting sun his legions placed,And King Sugríva held the woodEast of the gate where Rávan stood.On every side the myriads met,And Lanká walls of close besetThat scarce the roving gale could winA passage to the hosts within.Loud as the angry ocean roarWhen wild waves lash the rocky shore,Ten thousand thousand throats upsentA shout that tore the firmament,And Lanká with each grove and brookAnd tower and wall and rampart shook.The giants heard, and were appalled:Then Raghu son to Angad called,And, led by kingly duty,(950) gaveThis order merciful as brave:\"Go, Angad, Rávan presence seek,And thus my words of warning speak:\"How art thou changed and fallen now,O Monarch of the giants, thouWhose impious fury would not spareSaint, nymph, or spirit of the air;Whose foot in haughty triumph trodOn Yaksha, king, and Serpent God:How art thou fallen from thy prideWhich Brahmá favour fortified!With myriads at thy Lanká gateI stand my righteous ire to sate,And punish thee with sword and flame,The tyrant fiend who stole my dame.Now show the might, employ the guile,O Monarch of the giants\\' isle,Which stole a helpless dame away:Call up thy power and strength to-day.Once more I warn thee, Rákshas King,This hour the Maithil lady bring,And, yielding while there yet is time,Seek, suppliant, pardon for the crime,Or I will leave beneath the sunNo living Rákshas, no, not one.In vain from battle wilt thou fly,Or borne on pinions seek the sky;The hand of Ráma shall not spare;His fiery shaft shall smite thee there.\\' \"He ceased: and Angad bowed his head;Thence like embodied flame he sped,And lighted from his airy roadWithin the Rákshas king abode.There sate, the centre of a ringOf counsellors, the giant king.Swift through the circle Angad pressed,And spoke with fury in his breast:\"Sent by the lord of Kosal land,His envoy here, O King, I stand,Angad the son of Báli: fameHas haply taught thine ears my name.Thus in the words of Ráma IAm come to warn thee or defy:Come forth, and fighting in the vanDisplay the spirit of a man.This arm shall slay thee, tyrant: allThy nobles, kith and kin shall fall:And earth and heaven, from terror freed,Shall joy to see the oppressor bleed.Vibhishan, when his foe is slain,Anointed king in peace shall reign.Once more I counsel thee: repent,Avoid the mortal punishment,With honour due the dame restore,And pardon for thy sin implore.\"Loud rose the king infuriate cry:\"Seize, seize the Vánar, let him die.\"Four of his band their lord obeyed,And eager hands on Angad laid.He purposing his strength to showGave no resistance to the foe,But swiftly round his captors castHis mighty arms and held them fast.Fierce shout and cry around him rang:Light to the palace roof he sprang,There his detaining arms unwound,And hurled the giants to the ground.Then, smiting with a fearful stroke,A turret from the roof he broke,--As when the fiery levin sentBy Indra from the clouds has rentThe proud peak of the Lord of Snow,--And flung the stony mass below.Again with loud terrific cryHe sprang exulting to the sky,And, joyous for his errand done,Stood by the side of Raghu son.Canto XLII. The Sally.Still was the cry, \"The Vánar foesAround the leaguered city close.\"King Rávan from the terrace gazedAnd saw, with eyes where fury blazed,The Vánar host in serried ranksPress to the moat and line the banks,And, first in splendour and in place,The lion lord of Raghu race.And Ráma looked on Lanká whereGay flags were streaming to the air,And, while keen sorrow pierced him through,His loving thoughts to Sítá flew:\"There, there in deep affliction liesMy darling with the fawn-like eyes.There on the cold bare ground she keepsSad vigil and for Ráma weeps.\"Mad with the thought, \"Charge, charge,\" he cried.\"Let earth with Rákshas blood be dyed.\"Responsive to his call rang outA loud, a universal shout,As myriads filled the moat with stone,Trees, rocks, and mountains overthrown,And charging at their leader callPressed forward furious to the wall.Some in their headlong ardour scaledThe rampart height, the guard assailed,And many a ponderous fragment rentFrom portal, tower, and battlement.Huge gates adorned with burnished goldWere loosed and lifted from their hold;And post and pillar, with a soundLike thunder, fell upon the ground.At every portal, east and westAnd north and south, the chieftains pressedEach in his post appointed ledHis myriads in the forest bred.\"Charge, let the gates be opened wide:Charge, charge, my giants,\" Rávan cried.They heard his voice, and loud and longRang the wild clamour of the throng,And shell and drum their notes upsent,And every martial instrument.Forth, at the bidding of their lordFrom every gate the giants poured,As, when the waters rise and swell,Huge waves preceding waves impel.Again from every Vánar throatA scream of fierce defiance smoteThe welkin: earth and sea and skyReëchoed with the awful cry.The roar of elephants, the neighOf horses eager for the fray.The frequent clash of warriors\\' steel,The rattling of the chariot wheel.Fierce was the deadly fight: opposedIn terrible array they closed,As when the Gods of heaven enragedWith rebel fiends wild battle waged.Axe, spear, and mace were wielded well:At every blow a Vánar fell.But shivered rock and brandished treeBrought many a giant on his knee,To perish in his turn beneathThe deadly wounds of nails and teeth.Canto XLIII. The Single Combats.Brave chiefs of each opposing sideTheir strength in single combat tried.Fierce Indrajít the fight beganWith Angad in the battle van.Sampáti, strongest of his race,Stood with Prajangha face to face.Hanúmán, Jambumáli metIn mortal opposition set.Vibhishan, brother of the lordOf Lanká, raised his threatening swordAnd singled out, with eyes aglowWith wrath, Satrughna for his foe.The mighty Gaja Tapan sought,And Níla with Nikumbha fought.Sugríva, Vánar king, defiedFierce Praghas long in battle tried,And Lakshman fearless in the fightEncountered Vírúpáksha might.To meet the royal Ráma cameWild Agniketu fierce as flame;Mitraghana, he who loved to strikeHis foeman and his friend alike:With Rasmiketu, known and fearedWhere\\'er his ponderous flag was reared;And Yajnakopa whose delightWas ruin of the sacred rite.These met and fought, with thousands more,And trampled earth was red with gore.Swift as the bolt which Indra sendsWhen fire from heaven the mountain rendsSmote Indrajít with furious blowsOn Angad queller of his foes.But Angad from his foeman toreThe murderous mace the warrior bore,And low in dust his coursers rolled,His driver, and his car of gold.Struck by the shafts Prajangha sped,The Vánar chief Sampáti bled,But, heedless of his gashes heCrushed down the giant with a tree.Then car-borne Jambumáli smoteHanumán on the chest and throat;But at the car the Vánar rushed,And chariot, steeds, and rider crushed.Sugríva whirled a huge tree round,And struck fierce Praghas to the ground.One arrow shot from Lakshman bowLaid mighty Vírúpáksha low.His giant foes round Ráma pressedAnd shot their shafts at head and breast;But, when the iron shower was spent,Four arrows from his bow he sent,And every missile, deftly sped;Cleft from the trunk a giant head.(951)Canto XLIV. The Night.The lord of Light had sunk and set:Night came; the foeman struggled yet;And fiercer for the gloom of nightGrew the wild fury of the fight.Scarce could each warrior eager eyeThe foeman from the friend descry.\"Rákshas or Vánar? say;\" cried each,And foe knew foeman by his speech.\"Why wilt thou fly? O warrior, stay:Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:\"Such were the cries, such words of fearSmote through the gloom each listening ear.Each swarthy rover of the nightWhose golden armour flashed with light,Showed like a towering hill embracedBy burning woods about his waist.The giants at the Vánars flew,And ravening ate the foes they slew:With mortal bite like serpent fang,The Vánars at the giants sprang,And car and steeds and they who boreThe pennons fell bedewed with gore.No serried band, no firm arrayThe fury of their charge could stay.Down went the horse and rider, downWent giant lords of high renown.Though midnight shade was dense and dark,With skill that swerved not from the markTheir bows the sons of Raghu drew,And each keen shaft a chieftain slew.Uprose the blinding dust from meadsPloughed by the cars and trampling steeds,And where the warriors fell the floodWas dark and terrible with blood.Six giants(952) singled Ráma out,And charged him with a furious shoutLoud as the roaring of the seaWhen every wind is raging free.Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;Six giants dead on earth were left.Nor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,And from the sounding weapon rainedA storm of shafts whose fiery glareFilled all the region of the air;And chieftains dropped before his aimLike moths that perish in the flame.Earth glistened where the arrows fell,As shines in autumn nights a dellWhich fireflies, flashing through the gloom,With momentary light illume.But Indrajít, when Báli son(953)The victory o\\'er the foe had won,Saw with a fury-kindled eyeHis mangled steeds and driver die;Then, lost in air, he fled the fight,And vanished from the victor sight.The Gods and saints glad voices raised,And Angad for his virtue praised;And Raghu sons bestowed the meedOf honour due to valorous deed.Compelled his shattered car to quit,Rage filled the soul of Indrajít,Who brooked not, strong by Brahmá graceDefeat from one of Vánar race.In magic mist concealed from viewHis bow the treacherous warrior drew,And Raghu sons were first to feelThe tempest of his winged steel.Then when his arrows failed to killThe princes who defied him still,He bound them with the serpent noose,(954)The magic bond which none might loose.Canto XLV. Indrajít Victory.Brave Ráma, burning still to knowThe station of his artful foe,Gave to ten chieftains, mid the bestOf all the host, his high behest.Swift rose in air the Vánar band:Each region of the sky they scanned:But Rávan son by magic skillChecked them with arrows swifter still,When streams of blood from chest and sideThe dauntless Vánars\\' limbs had dyed,The giant in his misty shroudShowed like the sun obscured by cloud.Like serpents hissing through the air,His arrows smote the princely pair;And from their limbs at every rentA stream of rushing blood was sent.Like Kinsuk trees they stood, that showIn spring their blossoms\\' crimson glow.Then Indrajít with fury eyedIkshváku royal sons, and cried:\"Not mighty Indra can assailOr see me when I choose to veilMy form in battle: and can ye,Children of earth, contend with me?The arrowy noose this hand has shotHas bound you with a hopeless knot;And, slaughtered by my shafts and bow,To Yáma hall this hour ye go.\"He spoke, and shouted. Then anewThe arrows from his bowstring flew,And pierced, well aimed with perfect art,Each limb and joint and vital part.Transfixed with shafts in every limb,Their strength relaxed, their eyes grew dim.As two tall standards side by side,With each sustaining rope untied,Fall levelled by the howling blast,So earth majestic lords at lastBeneath the arrowy tempest reeled,And prostrate pressed the battle field.Canto XLVI. Indrajít Triumph.The Vánar chiefs whose piercing eyesScanned eagerly the earth and skies,Saw the brave brothers wounded soreTransfixed with darts and stained with gore.The monarch of the Vánar race,With wise Vibhishan, reached the place;Angad and Níla came behind,And others of the forest kind,And standing with Hanúmán thereLamented for the fallen pair.Their melancholy eyes they raised;In fruitless search a while they gazed.But magic arts Vibhishan knew;Not hidden from his keener view,Though veiled by magic from the rest,The son of Rávan stood confessed.Fierce Indrajít with savage prideThe fallen sons of Raghu eyed,And every giant heart was proudAs thus the warrior cried aloud:\"Slain by mine arrows Ráma lies,And closed in death are Lakshman eyes.Dead are the mighty princes whoDúshan and Khara smote and slew.The Gods and fiends may toil in vainTo free them from the binding chain.The haughty chief, my father dread,Who drove him sleepless from his bed,While Lanká, troubled like a brookIn rain time, heard his name and shook:He whose fierce hate our lives pursuedLies helpless by my shafts subdued.Now fruitless is each wondrous deedWrought by the race the forests breed,And fruitless every toil at lastLike cloudlets when the rains are past.\"Then rose the shout of giants loudAs thunder from a bursting cloud,When, deeming Ráma, dead, they raisedTheir voices and the conqueror praised.Still motionless, as lie the slain,The brothers pressed the bloody plain,No sigh they drew, no breath they heaved,And lay as though of life bereaved.Proud of the deed his art had done,To Lanká town went Rávan son,Where, as he passed, all fear was stilled,And every heart with triumph filled.Sugríva trembled as he viewedEach fallen prince with blood bedewed,And in his eyes which overflowedWith tears the flame of anger glowed.\"Calm,\" cried Vibhishan, \"calm thy fears,And stay the torrent of thy tears.Still must the chance of battle change,And victory still delight to range.Our cause again will she befriendAnd bring us triumph in the end.This is not death: each prince will breakThe spell that holds him, and awake;Nor long shall numbing magic bindThe mighty arm, the lofty mind.\"He ceased: his finger bathed in dewAcross Sugríva eyes he drew;From dulling mist his vision freed,And spoke these words to suit the need:\"No time is this for fear: awayWith fainting heart and weak delay.Now, e\\'en the tear which sorrow wringsFrom loving eyes destruction brings.Up, on to battle at the headOf those brave troops which Ráma led.Or guardian by his side remainTill sense and strength the prince regain.Soon shall the trance-bound pair revive,And from our hearts all sorrow drive.Though prostrate on the earth he lie,Deem not that Ráma death is nigh;Deem not that Lakshmí will forgetOr leave her darling champion yet.Rest here and be thy heart consoled;Ponder my words, be firm and bold.I, foremost in the battlefield,Will rally all who faint or yield.Their staring eyes betray their fear;They whisper each in other ear.They, when they hear my cheering cryAnd see the friend of Ráma nigh,Will cast their gloom and fears awayLike faded wreaths of yesterday.\"Thus calmed he King Sugríva dread;Then gave new heart to those who fled.Fierce Indrajít, his soul on fireWith pride of conquest, sought his sire,Raised reverent hands, and told him all,The battle and the princes\\' fall.Rejoicing at his foes\\' defeatUpsprang the monarch from his seat,Girt by his giant courtiers: roundHis warrior son his arms he wound,Close kisses on his head applied,And heard again how Ráma died.Canto XLVII. Sítá.Still on the ground where Ráma sleptTheir faithful watch the Vánars kept.There Angad stood o\\'erwhelmed with griefAnd many a lord and warrior chief;And, ranged in densest mass around,Their tree-armed legions held the ground.Far ranged each Vánar eager eye,Now swept the land, now sought the sky,All fearing, if a leaf was stirred,A Rákshas in the sound they heard.The lord of Lanká in his hall,Rejoicing at his foeman fall,Commanded and the warders cameWho ever watched the Maithil dame.\"Go,\" cried the Rákshas king, \"relateTo Janak child her husband fate.Low on the earth her Ráma lies,And dark in death are Lakshman eyes.Bring forth my car and let her rideTo view the chieftains side by side.The lord to whom her fancy turnedFor whose dear sake my love she spurned,Lies smitten, as he fiercely ledThe battle, with his brother dead.Lead forth the royal lady: goHer husband lifeless body show.Then from all doubt and terror freeHer softening heart will turn to me.\"They heard his speech: the car was brought;That shady grove the warders soughtWhere, mourning Ráma night and day,The melancholy lady lay.They placed her in the car and throughThe yielding air they swiftly flew.The lady looked upon the plain,Looked on the heaps of Vánar slain,Saw where, triumphant in the fight,Thronged the fierce rovers of the night,And Vánar chieftains, mournful-eyed,Watched by the fallen brothers\\' side.There stretched upon his gory bedEach brother lay as lie the dead,With shattered mail and splintered bowPierced by the arrows of the foe.When on the pair her eyes she bent,Burst from her lips a wild lamentHer eyes o\\'erflowed, she groaned and sighedAnd thus in trembling accents cried:Canto XLVIII. Sítá Lament.\"False are they all, proved false to-day,The prophets of my fortune, theyWho in the tranquil time of oldA blessed life for me foretold,Predicting I should never knowA childless dame, a widow woe,False are they all, their words are vain,For thou, my lord and life, art slain.False was the priest and vain his loreWho blessed me in those days of yoreBy Ráma side in bliss to reign:For thou, my lord and life, art slain.They hailed me happy from my birth,Proud empress of the lord of earth.They blessed me--but the thought is pain--For thou, my lord and life, art slain.Ah, fruitless hope! each glorious signThat stamps the future queen is mine,With no ill-omened mark to showA widow crushing hour of woe.They say my hair is black and fine,They praise my brows\\' continuous line;My even teeth divided well,My bosom for its graceful swell.They praise my feet and fingers oft;They say my skin is smooth and soft,And call me happy to possessThe twelve fair marks that bring success.(955)But ah, what profit shall I gain?Thou, O my lord and life, art slain.The flattering seer in former daysMy gentle girlish smile would praise,And swear that holy water shedBy Bráhman hands upon my headShould make me queen, a monarch bride:How is the promise verified?Matchless in might the brothers slewIn Janasthán the giant crew.And forced the indomitable seaTo let them pass to rescue me.Theirs was the fiery weapon hurledBy him who rules the watery world;(956)Theirs the dire shaft by Indra sped;Theirs was the mystic Brahmá Head.(957)In vain they fought, the bold and brave:A coward hand their death-wounds gave.By secret shafts and magic spellThe brothers, peers of Indra, fell.That foe, if seen by Ráma eyeOne moment, had not lived to fly.Though swift as thought, his utmost speedHad failed him in the hour of need.No might, no tear, no prayer may stayFate dark inevitable day.Nor could their matchless valour shieldThese heroes on the battle field.I sorrow for the noble dead,I mourn my hopes for ever fled;But chief my weeping eyes o\\'erflowFor Queen Kausalyá hopeless woe.The widowed queen is counting nowEach hour prescribed by Ráma vow,And lives because she longs to seeOnce more her princely sons and me.\"Then Trijatá,(958) of gentler mouldThough Rákshas born, her grief consoled:\"Dear Queen, thy causeless woe dispel:Thy husband lives, and all is well.Look round: in every Vánar faceThe light of joyful hope I trace.Not thus, believe me, shine the eyesOf warriors when their leader dies.An Army, when the chief is dead,Flies from the field dispirited.Here, undisturbed in firm array,The Vánars by the brothers stay.Love prompts my speech; no longer grieve;Ponder my counsel, and believe.These lips of mine from earliest youthHave spoken, and shall speak, the truth.Deep in my heart thy gentle graceAnd patient virtues hold their place.Turn, lady, turn once more thine eye:Though pierced with shafts the heroes lie,On brows and cheeks with blood-drops wetThe light of beauty lingers yet.Such beauty ne\\'er is found in death,But vanishes with parting breath.O, trust the hope these tokens give:The heroes are not dead, but live.\"Then Sítá joined her hands, and sighed,\"O, may thy words be verified!\"The car was turned, which fleet as thoughtThe mourning queen to Lanká brought.They led her to the garden, whereAgain she yielded to despair,Lamenting for the chiefs who bledOn earth cold bosom with the dead.Canto XLIX. Ráma Lament.Ranged round the spot where Ráma fellEach Vánar chief stood sentinel.At length the mighty hero brokeThe trance that held him, and awoke.He saw his senseless brother, dyedWith blood from head to foot, and cried:\"What have I now to do with lifeOr rescue of my prisoned wife,When thus before my weeping eyes,Slain in the fight, my brother lies?A queen like Sítá I may findAmong the best of womankind,But never such a brother, triedIn war, my guardian, friend, and guide.If he be dead, the brave and true,I will not live but perish too.How, reft of Lakshman, shall I meetMy mother, and Kaikeyí greet?My brother eager question brook,And fond Sumitrá longing look?What shall I say, o\\'erwhelmed with shameTo cheer the miserable dame?How, when she hears her son is dead,Will her sad heart be comforted?Ah me, for longer life unfitThis mortal body will I quit;For Lakshman slaughtered for my sake,From sleep of death will never wake.Ah when I sank oppressed with care,Thy gentle voice could soothe despair.And art thou, O my brother, killed?Is that dear voice for ever stilled?Cold are those lips, my brother, whenceCame never word to breed offence?Ah stretched upon the gory plainMy brother lies untimely slain:Numbed is the mighty arm that slewThe leaders of the giant crew.Transfixed with shafts, with blood-streams red,Thou liest on thy lowly bed:So sinks to rest, his journey done,Mid arrowy rays the crimson sun.Thou, when from home and sire I fled,The wood wild ways with me wouldst tread:Now close to thine my steps shall be,For I in death will follow thee.Vibhishan now will curse my name,And Ráma as a braggart blame,Who promised--but his word is vain--That he in Lanká isle should reign.Return, Sugríva: reft of meLead back thy Vánars o\\'er the sea,Nor hope to battle face to faceWith him who rules the giant race.Well have ye done and nobly fought,And death in desperate combat sought.All that heroic might can do,Brave Vánars, has been done by you.My faithful friends I now dismiss:Return: my last farewell is this.\"Bedewed with tears was every cheekAs thus the Vánars heard him speak.Vibhishan on the field had stayedThe Vánar hosts who fled dismayed.Now lifting up his mace on highWith martial step the chief drew nigh.The hosts who watched by Ráma sideBeheld his shape and giant stride.\\'Tis he, \\'tis Rávan son, they thought:And all in flight their safety sought.Canto L. The Broken Spell.Sugríva viewed the flying crowd,And thus to Angad cried aloud:\"Why run the trembling hosts, as fleeStorm-scattered barks across the sea?\"\"Dost thou not mark,\" the chief replied,\"Transfixed with shafts, with bloodstreams dyed,With arrowy toils about them wound,The sons of Raghu on the ground?\"That moment brought Vibhishan near.Sugríva knew the cause of fear,And ordered Jámbaván, who ledThe bears, to check the hosts that fled.The king of bears his hest obeyed:The Vánars\\' headlong flight was stayed.A little while Vibhishan eyedThe brothers fallen side by side.His giant fingers wet with dewAcross the heroes\\' eyes he drew,Still on the pair his sad look bent,And spoke these word in wild lament:\"Ah for the mighty chiefs brought lowBy coward hand and stealthy blow!Brave pair who loved the open fight,Slain by that rover of the night.Dishonest is the victory wonBy Indrajít my brother son.I on their might for aid relied,And in my cause they fought and died.Lost is the hope that soothed each pain:I live, but live no more to reign,While Lanká lord, untouched by ill,Exults in safe defiance still.\"\"Not thus,\" Sugríva said, \"repine,For Lanká isle shall still be thine.Nor let the tyrant and his sonExult before the fight be done.These royal chiefs, though now dismayed,Freed from the spell by Garud aid,Triumphant yet the foe shall meetAnd lay the robber at their feet.\"His hope the Vánar monarch told,And thus Vibhishan grief consoled.Then to Sushen who at his sideExpectant stood, Sugríva cried:\"When these regain their strength and sense,Fly, bear them to Kishkindhá hence.Here with my legions will I stay,The tyrant and his kinsmen slay,And, rescued from the giant king,The Maithil lady will I bring,Like Glory lost of old, restoredBy Sakra, heaven almighty lord.\"Sushen made answer: \"Hear me yet:When Gods and fiends in battle met,So fiercely fought the demon crew,So wild a storm of arrows flew,That heavenly warriors faint with pain,Sank smitten by the ceaseless rain.Vrihaspati,(959) with herb and spell,Cured the sore wounds of those who fell.And, skilled in arts that heal and save,New life and sense and vigour gave.Far, on the Milky Ocean shore,Still grow those herbs in boundless store;Let swiftest Vánars thither speedAnd bring them for our utmost need.Those herbs that on the mountain springLet Panas and Sampáti bring,For well the wondrous leaves they know,That heal each wound and life bestow.Beside that sea which, churned of yore,The amrit on its surface bore,Where the white billows lash the land,Chandra fair height and Drona stand.Planted by Gods each glittering steepLooks down upon the milky deep.Let fleet Hanúmán bring us thenceThose herbs of wondrous influence.\"Meanwhile the rushing wind grew loud,Red lightnings flashed from banks of cloud.The mountains shook, the wild waves rose,And smitten with resistless blowsUnrooted fell each stately treeThat fringed the margin of the sea.All life within the waters fearedThen, as the Vánars gazed, appearedKing Garud self, a wondrous sight,Disclosed in flames of fiery light.From his fierce eye in sudden dreadAll serpents in a moment fled.And those transformed to shaft that boundThe princes vanished in the ground.On Raghu sons his eyes he bent,And hailed the lords armipotent.Then o\\'er them stooped the feathered king,And touched their faces with his wing.His healing touch their pangs allayed,And closed each rent the shafts had made.Again their eyes were bright and bold,Again the smooth skin shone like gold.Again within their shell enshrinedCame memory and each power of mind:And, from those numbing bonds released,Their spirit, zeal, and strength increased.Firm on their feet they stood, and thenThus Ráma spake, the lord of men:\"By thy dear grace in sorest needFrom deadly bonds we both are freed.To these glad eyes as welcome nowAs Aja(960) or my sire art thou.Who art thou, mighty being? say,Thus glorious in thy bright array.\"He ceased: the king of birds replied,While flashed his eye with joy and pride:\"In me, O Raghu son, beholdOne who has loved thee from of old:Garud, the lord of all that fly,Thy guardian and thy friend am I.Not all the Gods in heaven could looseThese numbing bonds, this serpent noose,Wherewith fierce Rávan son, renownedFor magic arts, your limbs had bound.Those arrows fixed in every limbWere mighty snakes, transformed by him.Blood thirsty race, they live beneathThe earth, and slay with venomed teeth.On, smite the lord of Lanká isle,But guard you from the giants\\' guileWho each dishonest art employAnd by deceit brave foes destroy.So shall the tyrant Rávan bleed,And Sítá from his power be freed.\"Thus Garud spake: then, swift as thought,The region of the sky he sought,Where in the distance like a blazeOf fire he vanished from the gaze.Then the glad Vánars\\' joy rang outIn many a wild tumultuous shout,And the loud roar of drum and shellStartled each distant sentinel.Canto LI. Dhúmráksha Sally.King Rávan, where he sat within,Heard from his hall the deafening din,And with a spirit ill at easeAddressed his lords in words like these:\"That warlike shout, those joyous cries,Loud as the thunder of the skies,Upsent from every Vánar throat,Some new-born confidence denote.Hark, how the sea and trembling shoreRe-echo with the Vánars\\' roar.Though arrowy chains, securely twinedBoth Ráma and his brother bind,Still must the fierce triumphant shoutDisturb my soul with rising doubt.Swift envoys to the army send,And learn what change these cries portend.\"Obedient, at their master call,Fleet giants clomb the circling wall.They saw the Vánars formed and led:They saw Sugríva at their head,The brothers from their bonds released:And hope grew faint and fear increased.Their faces pale with doubt and dread,Back to the giant king they sped,And to his startled ear revealedThe tidings of the battle field.The flush of rage a while gave placeTo chilling fear that changed his face:\"What?\" cried the tyrant, \"are my foesFreed from the binding snakes that closeWith venomed clasp round head and limb,Bright as the sun and fierce like him:The spell a God bestowed of yore,The spell that never failed before?If arts like these be useless, howShall giant strength avail us now?Go forth, Dhúmráksha, good at need,The bravest of my warriors lead:Force through the foe thy conquering way,And Ráma and the Vánars slay.\"Before his king with reverence dueDhúmráksha bowed him, and withdrew.Around him at his summons cameFierce legions led by chiefs of fame.Well armed with sword and spear and mace,They hurried to the gathering place,And rushed to battle, borne at speedBy elephant and car and steed.Canto LII. Dhúmráksha Death.The Vánars saw the giant foePour from the gate in gallant show,Rejoiced with warriors\\' fierce delightAnd shouted, longing for the fight.Near came the hosts and nearer yet:Dire was the tumult as they met,As, serried line to line opposed,The Vánars and the giants closed.Fierce on the foe the Vánars rushed,And, wielding trees, the foremost crushed;But, feathered from the heron wing,With eager flight from sounding string,Against them shot with surest aimA ceaseless storm of arrows came:And, pierced in head and chest and side,Full many a Vánar fell and died.They perished slain in fierce attacksWith sword and pike and battle-axe;But myriads following undismayedTheir valour in the fight displayed.Unnumbered Vánars rent and tornWith shaft and spear to earth were borne.But crushed by branchy trees and blocksOf jagged stone and shivered rocksWhich the wild Vánars wielded wellThe bravest of the giants fell.Their trampled banners strewed the fields,And broken swords and spears and shields;And, crushed by blows which none might stay,Cars, elephants, and riders lay.Dhúmráksha turned his furious eyeAnd saw his routed legions fly.Still dauntless, with terrific blows,He struck and slew his foremost foes.At every blow, at every thrust,He laid a Vánar in the dust.So fell they neath the sword and lanceIn battle wild Gandharva(961) dance,Where clang of bow and clash of swordDid duty for the silvery chord,And hoofs that rang and steeds that neighedLoud concert for the dancers made.So fiercely from Dhúmráksha bowHis arrows rained in ceaseless flow,The Vánar legions turned and fledTo all the winds discomfited.Hanúmán saw the Vánars fly;He heaved a mighty rock on high.His keen eyes flashed with wrathful fire,And, rapid as the Wind his sire,Strong as the rushing tempests are,He hurled it at the advancing car.Swift through the air the missile sang:The giant from the chariot sprang,Ere crushed by that terrific blowLay pole and wheel and flag and bow.Hanúmán eyes with fury blazed:A mountain rocky peak he raised,Poised it on high in act to throw,And rushed upon his giant foe.Dhúmráksha saw: he raised his maceAnd smote Hanúmán on the face,Who maddened by the wound keen pangAgain upon his foeman sprang;And on the giant head the rockDescended with resistless shock.Crushed was each limb: a shapeless massHe lay upon the blood-stained grass.Canto LIII. Vajradanshtra Sally.When Rávan in his palace heardThe mournful news, his wrath was stirred;And, gasping like a furious snake,To Vajradanshtra thus he spake:\"Go forth, my fiercest captain, leadThe bravest of the giants\\' breed.Go forth, the sons of Raghu slayAnd by their side Sugríva lay.\"He ceased: the chieftain bowed his headAnd forth with gathered troops he sped.Cars, camels, steeds were well arrayed,And coloured banners o\\'er them played.Rings decked his arms: about his waistThe life-protecting mail was braced,And on the chieftain forehead setGlittered his cap and coronet.Borne on a bannered car that glowedWith golden sheen the warrior rode,And footmen marched with spear and swordAnd bow and mace behind their lord.In pomp and pride of warlike stateThey sallied from the southern gate,But saw, as on their way they sped,Dread signs around and overhead.For there were meteors falling fast,Though not a cloud its shadow cast;And each ill-omened bird and beast,Forboding death, the fear increased,While many a giant slipped and reeled,Falling before he reached the field.They met in mortal strife engaged,And long and fierce the battle raged.Spears, swords uplifted, gleamed and flashed,And many a chief to earth was dashed.A ceaseless storm of arrows rained,And limbs were pierced and blood-distained.Terrific was the sound that filledThe air, and every heart was chilled,As hurtling o\\'er the giants flewThe rocks and trees which Vánars threw.Fierce as a hungry lion whenUnwary deer approach his den,Angad, his eyes with fury red,Waving a tree above his head,Rushed with wild charge which none could stayWhere stood the giants\\' dense array.Like tall trees levelled by the blastBefore him fell the giants fast,And earth that streamed with blood was strownWith warriors, steeds, and cars o\\'erthrown.Canto LIV. Vajradanshtra Death.The giant leader fiercely rainedHis arrows and the fight maintained.Each time the clanging cord he drewHis certain shaft a Vánar slew.Then, as the creatures he has madeFly to the Lord of Life for aid,To Angad for protection fledThe Vánar hosts dispirited.Then raged the battle fiercer yetWhen Angad and the giant met.A hundred thousand arrows, hotWith flames of fire, the giant shot;And every shaft he deftly sentHis foeman body pierced and rent.From Angad limbs ran floods of gore:A stately tree from earth he tore,Which, maddened as his gashes bled,He hurled at his opponent head.His bow the dauntless giant drew;To meet the tree swift arrows flew,Checked the huge missile onward way,And harmless on the earth it lay.A while the Vánar chieftain gazed,Then from the earth a rock he raisedRent from a thunder-splitten height,And cast it with resistless might.The giant marked, and, mace in hand,Leapt from his chariot to the sand,Ere the rough mass descending brokeThe seat, the wheel, the pole and yoke.Then Angad seized a shattered hill,Whereon the trees were flowering still,And with full force the jagged peakFell crashing on the giant cheek.He staggered, reeled, and fell: the bloodGushed from the giant in a flood.Reft of his might, each sense astray,A while upon the sand he lay.But strength and wandering sense returnedAgain his eyes with fury burned,And with his mace upraised on highHe wounded Angad on the thigh.Then from his hand his mace he threw,And closer to his foeman drew.Then with their fists they fought, and smoteOn brow and cheek and chest and throat.Worn out with toil, their limbs bedewed,With blood, the strife they still renewed,Like Mercury and fiery MarsMet in fierce battle mid the stars.A while the deadly fight was stayed:Each armed him with his trusty bladeWhose sheath with tinkling bells supplied,And golden net, adorned his side;And grasped his ponderous leather shieldTo fight till one should fall or yield.Unnumbered wounds they gave and took:Their wearied bodies reeled and shook.At length upon the sand that drankStreams of their blood the warriors sank,But as a serpent rears his headSore wounded by a peasant tread,So Angad, fallen on his knees,Yet gathered strength his sword to seize;And, severed by the glittering blade,The giant head on earth was laid.[I omit Cantos LV, LVI, LVII, and LVIII, which relate how Akampan andPrahasta sally out and fall. There is little novelty of incident in theseCantos and the results are exactly the same as before. In Canto LV,Akampan, at the command of Rávan, leads forth his troops. Evil omens areseen and heard. The enemies meet, and many fall on each side, the Vánarstransfixed with arrows, the Rákshases crushed with rocks and trees.In Canto LVI Akampan sees that the Rákshases are worsted, and fights withredoubled rage and vigour. The Vánars fall fast under his \"nets ofarrows.\" Hanumán comes to the rescue. He throws mountain peaks at thegiant which are dexterously stopped with flights of arrows; and at lastbeats him down and kills him with a tree.In Canto LVII, Rávan is seriously alarmed. He declares that he himself,Kumbhakarna or Prahasta, must go forth. Prahasta sallies out vaunting thatthe fowls of the air shall eat their fill of Vánar flesh.In Canto LVIII, the two armies meet. Dire is the conflict; ceaseless isthe rain of stones and arrows. At last Níla meets Prahasta and breaks hisbow. Prahasta leaps from his car, and the giant and the Vánar fight onfoot. Níla with a huge tree crushes his opponent who falls like a treewhen its roots are cut.]Canto LIX. Rávan Sally.They told him that the chief was killed,And Rávan breast with rage was filled.Then, fiercely moved by wrath and pride,Thus to his lords the tyrant cried:\"No longer, nobles, may we showThis lofty scorn for such a foeBy whom our bravest, with his trainOf steeds and elephants, is slain.Myself this day will take the field,And Raghu sons their lives shall yield.\"High on the royal car, that glowedWith glory from his face, he rode;And tambour shell and drum pealed out,And joyful was each giant shout.A mighty host, with eyeballs redLike flames of kindled fire, he led.He passed the city gate, and viewed,Arrayed, the Vánar multitude,Those wielding massy rocks, and theseArmed with the stems of uptorn trees,And Ráma with his eyes aglowWith warlike ardour viewed the foe,And thus the brave Vibhishan, bestOf weapon-wielding chiefs, addressed:\"What captain leads this bright arrayWhere lances gleam and banners play,And thousands armed with spear and swordAwait the bidding of their lord?\"\"Seest, thou,\" Vibhishan answered, \"oneWhose face is as the morning sun,Preëminent for hugest frame?Akampan(962) is the giant name.Behold that chieftain, chariot-borne,Whom Brahmá chosen gifts adorn.He wields a bow like Indra own;A lion on his flag is shown,His eyes with baleful fire are lit:\\'Tis Rávan son, \\'tis Indrajít.There, brandishing in mighty handsHis huge bow, Atikáya stands.And that proud warrior o\\'er whose headA moon-bright canopy is spread:Whose might, in many a battle tried,Has tamed imperial Indra pride;Who wears a crown of burnished gold,Is Lanká lord the lofty-souled.\"He ceased: and Ráma knew his foe,And laid an arrow on his bow:\"Woe to the wretch,\" he cried, \"whom fateAbandons to my deadly hate.\"He spoke, and, firm by Lakshman side,The giant to the fray defied.The lord of Lanká bade his trainOf warriors by the gates remain,To guard the city from surpriseBy Ráma forest born allies.Then as some monster of the seaCleaves swift-advancing billows, heCharged with impetuous onset throughThe foe, and cleft the host in two.Sugríva ran, the king to meet:A hill uprooted from its seatHe hurled, with trees that graced the heightAgainst the rover of the night:But cleft with shafts that checked its wayHarmless upon the earth it lay.Then fiercer Rávan fury grew,An arrow from his side he drew,Swift as a thunderbolt, aglowWith fire, and launched it at the foe.Through flesh and bone a way it found,And stretched Sugríva on the ground.Sushen and Nala saw him fall,Gaváksha, Gavaya heard their call,And, poising hills, in act to flingThey charged amain the giant king.They charged, they hurled the hills in vain,He checked them with his arrowy rain,And every brave assailant feltThe piercing wounds his missiles dealt,Then smitten by the shafts that cameKeen, fleet, and thick, with certain aim,They fled to Ráma, sure defenceAgainst the oppressor violence,Then, reverent palm to palm applied,Thus Lakshman to his brother cried:\"To me, my lord, the task entrustTo lay this giant in the dust.\"\"Go, then,\" said Ráma, \"bravely fight;Beat down this rover of the night.But he, unmatched in bold emprise,Fears not the Lord of earth and skies,Keep on thy guard: with keenest eyeThy moments of attack espy.Let hand and eye in due accordProtect thee with the bow and sword.\"Then Lakshman round his brother threwHis mighty arms in honour due,Bent lowly down his reverent head,And onward to the battle sped.Hanúmán from afar beheldHow Rávan shafts the Vánars quelled:To meet the giant car he ran,Raised his right arm and thus began:\"If Brahmá boon thy life has screenedFrom Yaksha, God, Gandharva, fiend,With these contending fear no ill,But tremble at a Vánar still.\"With fury flashing from his eyeThe lord of Lanká made reply:\"Strike, Vánar, strike: the fray begin,And hope eternal fame to win.This arm shall prove thee in the strifeAnd end thy glory and thy life.\"\"Remember,\" cried the Wind-God son,\"Remember all that I have done,My prowess, King, thou knowest well,Shown in the fight when Aksha(963) fell.\"With heavy hand the giant smoteHanúmán on the chest and throat,Who reeled and staggered to and fro,Stunned for a moment by the blow.Till, mustering strength, his hand he rearedAnd struck the foe whom Indra feared.His huge limbs bent beneath the shock,As mountains, in an earthquake, rock,And from the Gods and sages pealedShouts of loud triumph as he reeled.But strength returning nerved his frame:His eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame.No living creature might resistThat blow of his tremendous fistWhich fell upon Hanúmán flank:And to the ground the Vánar sank,No sign of life his body showed:And Rávan in his chariot rodeAt Níla; and his arrowy rainFell on the captain and his train.Fierce Níla stayed his Vánar band,And, heaving with his single handA mountain peak, with vigorous swingHurled the huge missile at the king.Hanúmán life and strength regained,Burned for the fight and thus complained:\"Why, coward giant, didst thou fleeAnd leave the doubtful fight with me?\"Seven mighty arrows keen and fleetThe giant launched, the hill to meet;And, all its force and fury stayed,The harmless mass on earth was laid.Enraged the Vánar chief beheldThe mountain peak by force repelled,And rained upon the foe a showerOf trees uptorn with branch and flower.Still his keen shafts which pierced and rentEach flying tree the giant sent:Still was the Vánar doomed to feelThe tempest of the winged steel.Then, smarting from that arrowy storm,The Vánar chief condensed his form,(964)And lightly leaping from the groundOn Rávan standard footing found;Then springing unimpeded downStood on his bow and golden crown.The Vánar nimble leaps amazedIkshváku son who stood and gazed.The giant, raging in his heart,Laid on his bow a fiery dart;The Vánar on his flagstaff eyed,And thus in tones of fury cried:\"Well skilled in magic lore art thou:But will thine art avail thee now?See if thy magic will defendThy life against the dart I send.\"Thus Rávan spake, the giant king,And loosed the arrow from the string.It pierced, with direst fury sped,The Vánar with its flaming head.His father might, his power innatePreserved him from the threatened fate.Upon his knees he fell, distainedWith streams of blood, but life remained.Still Rávan for the battle burned:At Lakshman next his car he turned,And charged amain with furious show,Straining in mighty hands his bow.\"Come,\" Lakshman cried, \"assay the fight:Leave foes unworthy of thy might.\"Thus Lakshman spoke: and Lanká lordHeard the dread thunder of the cord.And mad with burning rage and prideIn hasty words like these replied:\"Joy, joy is mine, O Raghu son:Thy fate to-day thou canst not shun.Slain by mine arrows thou shalt treadThe gloomy pathway of the dead.\"Thus as he spoke his bow he drew,And seven keen shafts at Lakshman flew,But Raghu son with surest aimCleft every arrow as it came.Thus with fleet shafts each warrior shotAgainst his foe, and rested not.Then one choice weapon from his store,By Brahmá self bestowed of yore,Fierce as the flames that end the world,The giant king at Lakshman hurled.The hero fell, and racked with pain,Scarce could his hand his bow retain.But sense and strength resumed their seatAnd, lightly springing to his feet,He struck with one tremendous strokeAnd Rávan bow in splinters broke.From Lakshman cord three arrows flewAnd pierced the giant monarch through.Sore wounded Rávan closed, and roundIkshváku son his strong arms wound.With strength unrivalled, Brahmá gift,He strove from earth his foe to lift.\"Shall I,\" he cried, \"who overthrowMount Meru and the Lord of Snow,And heaven and all who dwell therein,Be foiled by one of Ráma kin?\"But though he heaved, and toiled, and strained,Unmoved Ikshváku son remained.His frame by those huge arms compressedThe giant God-given force confessed,But conscious that himself was partOf Vishnu, he was firm in heart.The Wind-God son the fight beheld,And rushed at Rávan, rage-impelled.Down crashed his mighty hand; the foeFull in the chest received the blow.His eyes grew dim, his knees gave way,And senseless on the earth he lay.The Wind-God son to Ráma boreDeep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.He whom no foe might lift or bendWas light as air to such a friend.The dart that Lakshman side had cleft,Untouched, the hero body left,And flashing through the air afarResumed its place in Rávan car;And, waxing well though wounded sore,He felt the deadly pain no more.And Rávan, though with deep wounds pained,Slowly his sense and strength regained,And furious still and undismayedOn bow and shaft his hand he laid.Then Hanumán to Ráma cried:\"Ascend my back, great chief, and rideLike Vishnu borne on Garud wing,To battle with the giant king.\"So, burning for the dire attack,Rode Ráma on the Vánar back,And with fierce accents loud and slowThus gave defiance to the foe,While his strained bowstring made a soundLike thunder when it shakes the ground:\"Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,The penalty of sin to pay.Stay! whither wilt thou fly, and howEscape the death that waits thee now?\"No word the giant king returned:His eyes with flames of fury burned.His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,And swift his fiery shafts were sent.Red torrents from the Vánar flowed:Then Ráma near to Rávan strode,And with keen darts that never failed,The chariot of the king assailed.With surest aim his arrows flew:The driver and the steeds he slew.And shattered with the pointed steelCar, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel.As Indra hurls his bolt to smiteMount Meru heaven-ascending height,So Ráma with a flaming dartStruck Lanká monarch near the heart,Who reeled and fell beneath the blowAnd from loose fingers dropped his bow.Bright as the sun, with crescent head,From Ráma bow an arrow sped,And from his forehead, proud no more,Cleft the bright coronet he wore.Then Ráma stood by Rávan sideAnd to the conquered giant cried:\"Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slainStrong heroes of the Vánar train.I will not strike or slay thee now,For weary, faint with fight art thou.To Lanká town thy footsteps bend,And there the night securely spend.To-morrow come with car and bow,And then my prowess shalt thou know.\"He ceased: the king in humbled prideRose from the earth and naught replied.With wounded limbs and shattered crownHe sought again his royal town.Canto LX. Kumbhakarna Roused.With humbled heart and broken prideThrough Lanká gate the giant hied,Crushed, like an elephant beneathA lion spring and murderous teeth,Or like a serpent \\'neath the wingAnd talons of the Feathered King.Such was the giant wild alarmAt arrows shot by Ráma arm;Shafts with red lightning round them curled,Like Brahmá bolts that end the world.Supported on his golden throne,With failing eye and humbled tone,\"Giants,\" he cried, \"the toil is vain,Fruitless the penance and the pain,If I whom Indra owned his peer,Secure from Gods, a mortal fear.My soul remembers, now too late,Lord Brahmá words who spoke my fate:\"Tremble, proud Giant,\" thus they ran,\"And dread thy death from slighted man.Secure from Gods and demons live,And serpents, by the boon I give.Against their power thy life is charmed,But against man is still unarmed.\"This Ráma is the man foretoldBy Anaranya(965) lips of old:\"Fear, Rávan, basest of the base:For of mine own imperial raceA prince in after time shall springAnd thee and thine to ruin bring.And Vedavatí,(966) ere she diedSlain by my ruthless insult, cried:\"A scion of my royal lineShall slay, vile wretch, both thee and thine.\"She in a later birth becameKing Janak child, now Ráma dame.Nandísvara(967) foretold this fate,And Umá(968) when I moved her hate,And Rambhá,(969) and the lovely childOf Varun(970) by my touch defiled.I know the fated hour is nigh:Hence, captains, to your stations fly.Let warders on the rampart stand:Place at each gate a watchful band;And, terror of immortal eyes,Let mightiest Kumbhakarna rise.He, slumbering, free from care and pain,By Brahmá curse, for months has lain.But when Prahasta death he hears,Mine own defeat and doubts and fears,The chief will rise to smite the foeAnd his unrivalled valour show.Then Raghu royal sons and allThe Vánars neath his might will fall.\"The giant lords his hest obeyed,They left him, trembling and afraid,And from the royal palace strodeTo Kumbhakarna vast abode.They carried garlands sweet and fresh,And reeking loads of blood and flesh.They reached the dwelling where he lay,A cave that reached a league each way,Sweet with fair blooms of lovely scentAnd bright with golden ornament.His breathings came so fierce and fast,Scarce could the giants brook the blast.They found him on a golden bedWith his huge limbs at length outspread.They piled their heaps of venison near,Fat buffaloes and boars and deer.With wreaths of flowers they fanned his face,And incense sweetened all the place.Each raised his mighty voice as loudAs thunders of an angry cloud,And conchs their stirring summons gaveThat echoed through the giant cave.Then on his breast they rained their blows,And high the wild commotion roseWhen cymbal vied with drum and horn.And war cries on the gale upborne.Through all the air loud discord spread,And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead.But still he slept and took his rest.Then dashed they on his shaggy chestClubs, maces, fragments of the rock:He moved not once, nor felt the shock.The giants made one effort moreWith shell and drum and shout and roar.Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,Rained blows upon his breast and side.And elephants were urged to aid,And camels groaned and horses neighed.They drenched him with a hundred pails,They tore his ears with teeth and nails.They bound together many a maceAnd beat him on the head and face;And elephants with ponderous treadStamped on his limbs and chest and head.The unusual weight his slumber broke:He started, shook his sides, and woke;And, heedless of the wounds and blows,Yawning with thirst and hunger rose,His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,Dire as the flame neath ocean tide.Red as the sun on Meru crestThe giant face his wrath expressed,And every burning breath he drewWas like the blast that rushes throughThe mountain cedars. Up he raisedHis awful head with eyes that blazedLike comets, dire as Death in formWho threats the worlds with fire and storm.The giants pointed to their storesOf buffaloes and deer and boars,And straight he gorged him with a floodOf wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.He ceased: the giants ventured nearAnd bent their lowly heads in fear.Then Kumbhakar[n.]a glared with eyesStill heavy in their first surprise,Still drowsy from his troubled rest,And thus the giant band addressed.\"How have ye dared my sleep to break?No trifling cause should bid me wake.Say, is all well? or tell the needThat drives you with unruly speedTo wake me. Mark the words I say,The king shall tremble in dismay,The fire be quenched and Indra slainEre ye shall break my rest in vain.\"Yúpáksha answered: \"Chieftain, hear;No God or fiend excites our fear.But men in arms our walls assail:We tremble lest their might prevail.For vengeful Ráma vows to slayThe foe who stole his queen away,And, matchless for his warlike deeds,A host of mighty Vánars leads.Ere now a monstrous Vánar came,Laid Lanká waste with ruthless flame,And Aksha, Rávan offspring, slewWith all his warrior retinue.Our king who never trembled yetFor heavenly hosts in battle met,At length the general dread has shared,O\\'erthrown by Ráma arm and spared.\"He ceased: and Kumbhakarna spake:\"I will go forth and vengeance take;Will tread their hosts beneath my feet,Then triumph-flushed our king will meet.Our giant bands shall eat their fillOf Vánars whom this arm shall kill.The princes\\' blood shall be my draught,The chieftains\\' shall by you be quaffed.\"He spake, and, with an eager strideThat shook the earth, to Rávan hied.Canto LXI. The Vánars\\' Alarm.The son of Raghu near the wallSaw, proudly towering over all,The mighty giant stride alongAttended by the warrior throng;Heard Kumbhakarna heavy feetAwake the echoes of the street;And, with the lust of battle fired,Turned to Vibhishan and inquired:\"Vibhishan, tell that chieftain nameWho rears so high his mountain frame;With glittering helm and lion eyes,Preëminent in might and sizeAbove the rest of giant birth,He towers the standard of the earth;And all the Vánars when they seeThe mighty warrior turn and flee.\"\"In him,\" Vibhishan answered, \"knowVisravas\\' son, the Immortals\\' foe,Fierce Kumbhakarna, mightier farThan Gods and fiends and giants are.He conquered Yáma in the fight,And Indra trembling owned his might.His arm the Gods and fiends subdued,Gandharvas and the serpent brood.The rest of his gigantic raceAre wondrous strong by God-giving grace;But nature at his birth to himGave matchless power and strength of limb.Scarce was he born, fierce monster, whenHe killed and ate a thousand men.The trembling race of men, appalled,On Indra for protection called;And he, to save the suffering world,His bolt at Kumbhakarna hurled.So awful was the monster yellThat fear on all the nations fell,He, rushing on with furious roar,A tusk from huge Airávat tore,And dealt the God so dire a blowThat Indra reeling left his foe,And with the Gods and mortals fledTo Brahmá throne dispirited.\"O Brahmá,\" thus the suppliants cried,\"Some refuge for this woe provide.If thus his maw the giant sateSoon will the world be desolate.\"The Self-existent calmed their woe,And spake in anger to their foe:\"As thou wast born, Pulastya son,That worlds might weep by thee undone,Thou like the dead henceforth shalt be:Such is the curse I lay on thee.\"Senseless he lay, nor spoke nor stirred;Such was the power of Brahmá word.But Rávan, troubled for his sake,Thus to the Self-existent spake:\"Who lops the tree his care has rearedWhen golden fruit has first appeared?Not thus, O Brahmá, deal with oneDescended from thine own dear son.(971)Still thou, O Lord, thy word must keep,He may not die, but let him sleep.Yet fix a time for him to breakThe chains of slumber and awake.\"He ceased: and Brahmá made reply;\"Six months in slumber shall he lieAnd then arising for a dayShall cast the numbing bonds away.\"Now Rávan in his doubt and dreadHas roused the monster from his bed,Who comes in this the hour of needOn slaughtered Vánars flesh to feed.Each Vánar, when his awe-struck eyesBehold the monstrous chieftain, flies.With hopeful words their minds deceive,And let our trembling hosts believeThey see no giant, but, displayed,A lifeless engine deftly made.\"Then Ráma called to Níla: \"Haste,Let troops near every gate be placed,And, armed with fragments of the rockAnd trees, each lane and alley block.\"Thus Ráma spoke: the chief obeyed,And swift the Vánars stood arrayed,As when the black clouds their battle form,The summit of a hill to storm.Canto LXII. Rávan Request.Along bright Lanká royal roadThe giant, roused from slumber, strode,While from the houses on his headA rain of fragrant flowers was shed.He reached the monarch gate whereonRich gems and golden fretwork shone.Through court and corridor that shookBeneath his tread his way he took,And stood within the chamber whereHis brother sat in dark despair.But sudden, at the grateful sightThe monarch eye again grew bright.He started up, forgot his fear,And drew his giant brother near.The younger pressed the elder feetAnd paid the King observance meet,Then cried: \"O Monarch, speak thy will,And let my care thy word fulfil.What sudden terror and dismayHave burst the bonds in which I lay?\"Fierce flashed the flame from Rávan eye,As thus in wrath he made reply:\"Fair time, I ween, for sleep is this,To lull thy soul in tranquil bliss,Unheeding, in oblivion drowned,The dangers that our lives surround.Brave Ráma, Dasaratha son,A passage o\\'er the sea has won,And, with the Vánar monarch aid,Round Lanká walls his hosts arrayed.Though never in the deadly fieldMy Rákshas troops were known to yield,The bravest of the giant trainHave fallen by the Vánars slain.Hence comes my fear. O fierce and brave,Go forth, our threatened Lanká save.Go forth, a dreadful vengeance take:For this, O chief, I bade thee wake.The Gods and trembling fiends have feltThe furious blows thine arm has dealt.Earth has no warrior, heaven has noneTo match thy might, Paulastya son.\"Canto LXIII. Kumbhakarna Boast.Then Kumbhakarna laughed aloudAnd cried; \"O Monarch, once so proud,We warned thee, but thou wouldst not hear;And now the fruits of sin appear.We warned thee, I, thy nobles, allWho loved thee, in thy council hall.Those sovereigns who with blinded eyesNeglect the foe their hearts despise,Soon, falling from their high estateBring on themselves the stroke of fate.Accept at length, thy life to save,The counsel sage Vibhishan gave,The prudent counsel spurned before,And Sítá to her lord restore.\"(972)The monarch frowned, by passion movedAnd thus in angry words reproved:\"Wilt thou thine elder brother school,Forgetful of the ancient ruleThat bids thee treat him as the sageWho guides thee with the lore of age?Think on the dangers of the day,Nor idly throw thy words away:If, led astray, by passion stirred,I in the pride of power have erred;If deeds of old were done amiss,No time for vain reproach is this.Up, brother; let thy loving careThe errors of thy king repair.\"To calm his wrath, his soul to ease,The younger spake in words like these:\"Yea, from our bosoms let us castAll idle sorrow for the past.Let grief and anger be repressed:Again be firm and self-possessed.This day, O Monarch, shalt thou seeThe Vánar legions turn and flee,And Ráma and his brother slainWith their hearts\\' blood shall dye the plain.Yea, if the God who rules the dead,And Varun their battalions led;If Indra with the Storm-Gods cameAgainst me, and the Lord of Flame,Still would I fight with all and slayThy banded foes, my King, to-day.If Raghu son this day withstandThe blow of mine uplifted hand,Deep in his breast my darts shall sink,And torrents of his life-blood drink.O fear not, in my promise trust:This arm shall lay him in the dust,Shall leave the fierce Sugríva dyedWith gore, and Lakshman by his side,And strike the great Hanúmán down,The spoiler of our glorious town.\"(973)Canto LXIV. Mahodar Speech.He ceased: and when his lips were closedMahodar thus his rede opposed:\"Why wilt thou shame thy noble birthAnd speak like one of little worth?Why boast thee thus in youthful prideRejecting wisdom for thy guide?How will thy single arm opposeThe victor of a thousand foes,Who proved in Janasthán his mightAnd slew the rovers of the night?The remnant of those legions, theyWho saw his power that fatal day,Now in this leaguered city dreadThe mighty chief from whom they fled.And wouldst thou meet the lord of men,Beard the great lion in his den,And, when thine eyes are open, breakThe slumber of a deadly snake?Who may an equal battle wageWith him, so awful in his rage,Fierce as the God of Death whom noneMay vanquish, Dasaratha son?But, Rávan, shall the lady stillRefuse compliance with thy will?No, listen, King, to this designWhich soon shall make the captive thine.This day through Lanká streets proclaimThat four of us(974) of highest fameWith Kumbhakarna at our headWill strike the son of Raghu dead.Forth to the battle will we goAnd prove our prowess on the foe.Then, if our bold attempt succeed,No further plans thy hopes will need.But if in vain our warriors strive,And Raghu son be left alive,We will return, and, wounded sore,Our armour stained with gouts of gore,Will show the shafts that rent each frame,Keen arrows marked with Ráma name,And say we giants have devouredThe princes whom our might o\\'erpowered.Then let the joyful tidings spreadThat Raghu royal sons are dead.To all around thy pleasure show,Gold, pearls, and precious robes, bestow.Gay garlands round the portals twine,Enjoy the banquet and the wine.Then go, the scornful lady seek,And woo her when her heart is weak.Rich robes and gold and gems display,And gently wile her grief away.Then will she feel her hopeless state,Widowed, forlorn, and desolate;Know that on thee her bliss depends,Far from her country and her friends;Then, her proud spirit overthrown,The lady will be all thine own.\"Canto LXV. Kumbhakarna Speech.But haughty Kumbhakarna spurnedHis counsel, and to Rávan turned:\"Thy life from peril will I freeAnd slay the foe who threatens thee.A hero never vaunts in vain,Like bellowing clouds devoid of rain,Nor, Monarch, be thine ear inclinedTo counsellors of slavish kind,Who with mean arts their king misleadAnd mar each gallant plan and deed.O, let not words like his beguileThe glorious king of Lanká isle.\"Thus scornful Kumbhakarna cried,And Rávan with a laugh replied:\"Mahodar fears and fain would shunThe battle with Ikshváku son.Of all my giant warriors, whoIs strong as thou, and brave and true?Ride, conqueror, to the battle ride,And tame the foeman senseless pride.Go forth like Yáma to the field,And let thine arm thy trident wield.Scared by the lightning of thine eyeThe Vánar hosts will turn and fly;And Ráma, when he sees thee near,With trembling heart will own his fear.\"The champion heard, and, well content,Forth from the hall his footsteps bent.He grasped his spear, the foeman dread,Black iron all, both shaft and head,Which, dyed in many a battle, boreGreat spots of slaughtered victims\\' gore.The king upon his neck had thrownThe jewelled chain which graced his own.And garlands of delicious scentAbout his limbs for ornament.Around his arms gay bracelets clung,And pendants in his ears were hung.Adorned with gold, about his waistHis coat of mail was firmly braced,And like Náráyan(975) or the GodWho rules the sky he proudly trod.Behind him went a mighty throngOf giant warriors tall and strong,On elephants of noblest breeds.With cars, with camels, and with steeds:And, armed with spear and axe and swordWere fain to battle for their lord.(976)Canto LXVI. Kumbhakarna Sally.In pomp and pride of warlike stateThe giant passed the city gate.He raised his voice: the hills, the shoreOf Lanká sea returned the roar.The Vánars saw the chief draw nighWhom not the ruler of the sky,Nor Yáma, monarch of the dead,Might vanquish, and affrighted fled.When royal Angad, Báli son,Saw the scared Vánars turn and run,Undaunted still he kept his ground,And shouted as he gazed around:\"O Nala, Níla, stay nor letYour souls your generous worth forget,O Kumud and Gaváksha, whyLike base-born Vánars will ye fly?Turn, turn, nor shame your order thus:This giant is no match for us\"They heard his voice: the flight was stayed;Again for war they stood arrayed,And hurled upon the foe a showerOf mountain peaks and trees in flower.Still on his limbs their missiles rained:Unmoved, their blows he still sustained,And seemed unconscious of the strokeWhen rocks against his body broke.Fierce as the flame when woods are dryHe charged with fury in his eye.Like trees consumed with fervent heatThey fell beneath the giant feet.Some o\\'er the ground, dyed red with gore,Fled wild with terror to the shore,And, deeming that all hope was lost,Ran to the bridge they erst had crossed.Some clomb the trees their lives to save,Some sought the mountain and the cave;Some hid them in the bosky dell,And there in deathlike slumber fell.When Angad saw the chieftains flyHe called them with a mighty cry:\"Once more, O Vánars, charge once more,On to the battle as before.In all her compass earth has not,To hide you safe, one secret spot.What! leave your arms? each nobler dameWill scorn her consort for the shame.This blot upon your names efface,And keep your valour from disgrace.Stay, chieftains; wherefore will ye run,A band of warriors scared by one?\"Scarce would they hear: they would not stay,And basely spoke in wild dismay:\"Have we not fought, and fought in vainHave we not seen our mightiest slain?The giant matchless force we fear,And fly because our lives are dear.\"But Báli son with gentle artDispelled their dread and cheered each heart.They turned and formed and waited stillObedient to the prince will.Canto LXVII. Kumbhakarna Death.Thus from their flight the Vánars turned,And every heart for battle burned,Determined on the spot to dieOr gain a warrior meed on high.Again the Vánars stooped to seizeTheir weapons, rocks and fallen trees;Again the deadly fight began,And fiercely at the giant ran.Unmoved the monster kept his place:He raised on high his awful mace,Whirled the huge weapon round his headAnd laid the foremost Vánars dead.Eight thousand fell bedewed with gore,Then sank and died seven hundred more.Then thirty, twenty, ten, or eightAt each fierce onset met their fate,And fast the fallen were devouredLike snakes by Garud beak o\\'erpowered.Then Dwivid from the Vánar van,Armed with an uptorn mountain, ran,Like a huge cloud when fierce winds blow,And charged amain the mountain foe.With wondrous force the hill he threw:O\\'er Kumbhakarna head it flew,And falling on his host afarCrushed many a giant, steed, and car.Rocks, trees, by fierce Hanúmán sped,Rained fast on Kumbhakarna head.Whose spear each deadlier missile stopped,And harmless on the plain it dropped.Then with his furious eyes aglowThe giant rushed upon the foe,Where, with a woody hill upheaved,Hanúmán might his charge received.Through his vast frame the giant feltThe angry blow Hanúmán dealt.He reeled a moment, sore distressed,Then smote the Vánar on the breast,As when the War-God furious strokeThrough Krauncha hill a passage broke.(977)Fierce was the blow, and deep and wideThe rent: with crimson torrents dyed,Hanúmán, maddened by the pain,Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,And from each Rákshas throat rang outLoud clamour and exultant shout.Then Níla hurled with mustered mightThe fragment of a mountain height;Nor would the rock the foe have missed,But Kumbhakarna raised his fistAnd smote so fiercely that the massFell crushed to powder on the grass.Five chieftains of the Vánar race(978)Charged Kumbhakarna face to face,And his huge frame they wildly beatWith rocks and trees and hands and feet.Round Rishabh first the giant woundHis arms and hurled him to the ground,Where speechless, senseless, wounded sore,He lay his face besmeared with gore.Then Níla with his fist he slew,And Sarabh with his knee o\\'erthrew,Nor could Gaváksha strength withstandThe force of his terrific hand.At Gandhamádan eager callRushed thousands to avenge their fall,Nor ceased those Vánars to assailWith knee and fist and tooth and nail.Around his foes the giant threwHis mighty arms, and nearer drewThe captives subject to his will:Then snatched them up and ate his fill.There was no respite then, no pause:Fast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:Yet, prisoned in that gloomy cave,Some Vánars still their lives could save:Some through his nostrils found a way,Some through his ears resought the day.Like Indra with his thunder, likeThe God of Death in act to strike,The giant seized his ponderous spear,And charged the foe in swift career.Before his might the Vánars fell,Nor could their hosts his charge repel.Then trembling, nor ashamed to run,They turned and fled to Raghu son.When Báli warrior son(979) beheldTheir flight, his heart with fury swelled.He rushed, with his terrific shout,To meet the foe and stay the rout.He came, he hurled a mountain peak,And smote the giant on the cheek.His ponderous spear the giant threw:Fierce was the cast, the aim was true;But Angad, trained in war and tried,Saw ere it came, and leapt aside.Then with his open hand he smoteThe giant on the chest and throat.That blow the giant scarce sustained;But sense and strength were soon regained.With force which nothing might resistHe caught the Vánar by the wrist,Whirled him, as if in pastime, round,And dashed him senseless on the ground.There low on earth his foe lay crushed:At King Sugríva next he rushed,Who, waiting for the charge, stood still,And heaved on high a shattered hill,He looked on Kumbhakarna dyedWith streams of blood, and fiercely cried:\"Great glory has thine arm achieved,And thousands of their lives bereaved.Now leave a while thy meaner foes,And brook the hill Sugríva throws.\"He spoke, and hurled the mass he held:The giant chest the stroke repelled,Then on the Vánars fell despair,And Rákshas clamour filled the air.The giant raised his arm, and fastCame the tremendous(980) spear he cast.Hanúmán caught it as it flew,And knapped it on his knee in two.The giant saw the broken spear:His clouded eye confessed his fear;Yet at Sugríva head he sentA peak from Lanká mountain rent.The rushing mass no might could stay:Sugríva fell and senseless lay.The giant stooped his foe to seize,And bore him thence, as bears the breezeA cloud in autumn through the sky.He heard the sad Immortals sigh,And shouts of triumph long and loudWent up from all the Rákshas crowd.Through Lanká gate the giant passedHolding his struggling captive fast,While from each terrace, house, and towerFell on his haughty head a showerOf fragrant scent and flowery rain,Blossoms and leaves and scattered grain.(981)By slow degrees the Vánars\\' lordFelt life and sense and strength restored.He heard the giants\\' joyful boast:He thought upon his Vánar host.His teeth and feet he fiercely plied,And bit and rent the giant side,Who, mad with pain and smeared with gore,Hurled to the ground the load he bore.Regardless of a storm of blowsSwift to the sky the Vánar rose,Then lightly like a flying ballHigh overleapt the city wall,And joyous for deliverance wonRegained the side of Raghu son.And Kumbhakarna, mad with hateAnd fury, sallied from the gate,The carnage of the foe renewedAnd filled his maw with gory food.Slaying, with headlong frenzy blind,Both Vánar foes and giant kind.Nor would Sumitrá valiant son(982)The might of Kumbhakarna shun,Who through his harness felt the stingOf keen shafts loosened from the string.His heart confessed the warrior power,And, bleeding from the ceaseless showerThat smote him on the chest and side,With words like these the giant cried:\"Well fought, well fought, Sumitrá son;Eternal glory hast thou won,For thou in desperate fight hast metThe victor never conquered yet,Whom, borne on huge Airávat back,E\\'en Indra trembles to attack.Go, son of Queen Sumitrá, go:Thy valour and thy strength I know.Now all my hope and earnest willIs Ráma in the fight to kill.Let him beneath my weapons fall,And I will meet and conquer all.\"The chieftain, of Sumitrá born,Made answer as he laughed in scorn:\"Yea, thou hast won a victor fameFrom trembling Gods and Indra shame.There waits thee now a mightier foeWhose prowess thou hast yet to know.There, famous in a hundred lands,Ráma the son of Raghu stands.\"Straight at the king the giant sped,And earth was shaken at his tread.His bow the hero grasped and strained,And deadly shafts in torrents rained.As Kumbhakarna felt each strokeFrom his huge mouth burst fire and smoke;His hands were loosed in mortal painAnd dropped his weapons on the plain.Though reft of spear and sword and maceNo terror changed his haughty face.With heavy hands he rained his blowsAnd smote to death a thousand foes.Where\\'er the furious monster strodeWhile down his limbs the red blood flowedLike torrents down a mountain side,Vánars and bears and giants died.High o\\'er his head a rock he swung,And the huge mass at Ráma flung.But Ráma arrows bright as flameShattered the mountain as it came.Then Raghu son, his eyes aglowWith burning anger, charged the foe,And as his bow he strained and triedWith fearful clang the cord replied.Wroth at the bowstring threatening clangTo meet his foe the giant sprang.High towering with enormous frameHuge as a wood-crowned hill he came.But Ráma firm and self-possessedIn words like these the foe addressed:\"Draw near, O Rákshas lord, draw near,Nor turn thee from the fight in fear.Thou meetest Ráma face to face,Destroyer of the giant race.Come, fight, and thou shalt feel this hour,Laid low in death, thy conqueror power.\"He ceased: and mad with wrath and prideThe giant champion thus replied:\"Come thou to me and thou shalt findA foeman of a different kind.No Khara, no Virádha,--thouHast met a mightier warrior now.The strength of Kumbhakarna fear,And dread the iron mace I rearThis mace in days of yore subduedThe Gods and Dánav multitude.Prove, lion of Ikshváku line,Thy power upon these limbs of mine.Then, after trial, shalt thou bleed,And with thy flesh my hunger feed.\"He ceased: and Ráma, undismayed,Upon his cord those arrows laidWhich pierced the stately Sál trees through,And Báli king of Vánars slew.They flew, they smote, but smote in vainThose mighty limbs that felt no pain.Then Ráma sent with surest aimThe dart that bore the Wind-God name.The missile from the giant toreHis huge arm and the mace it bore,Which crushed the Vánars where it fell:And dire was Kumbhakarna yell.The giant seized a tree, and thenRushed madly at the lord of men.Another dart, Lord Indra own,To meet his furious onset thrown,His left arm from the shoulder lopped,And like a mountain peak it dropped.Then from the bow of Ráma spedTwo arrows, each with crescent head;And, winged with might which naught could stay,They cut the giant legs away.They fell, and awful was the soundAs those vast columns shook the ground;And sky and sea and hill and caveIn echoing roars their answer gave.Then from his side the hero drewA dart that like the tempest flew--No deadlier shaft has ever flownThan that which Indra called his own--Nor could the giant mail-armed neckThe fury of the missile check.Through skin and flesh and bone it smoteAnd rent asunder head and throat.Down with the sound of thunder rolledThe head adorned with rings of gold,And crushed to pieces in its fallA gate, a tower, a massive wall.Hurled to the sea the body fell:Terrific was the ocean swell,Nor could swift fin and nimble leapSave the crushed creatures of the deep.Thus he who plagued in impious prideThe Gods and Bráhmans fought and died.Glad were the hosts of heaven, and longThe air re-echoed with their song.(983)Canto LXVIII. Rávan Lament.They ran to Rávan in his hallAnd told him of his brother fall:\"Fierce as the God who rules the dead,Upon the routed foe he fed;And, victor for a while, at lengthFell slain by Ráma matchless strength.Now like a mighty hill in sizeHis mangled trunk extended lies,And where he fell, a bleeding mass,Blocks Lanká gate that none may pass.\"The monarch heard: his strength gave way;And fainting on the ground he lay.Grieved at the giants\\' mournful tale,Long, shrill was Atikáya wail;And Trisirás in sorrow bowedHis triple head, and wept aloud.Mahodar, Mahápársva shedHot tears and mourned their brother dead.At length, his wandering sense restored,In loud lament cried Lanká lord:\"Ah chief, for might and valour famed,Whose arm the haughty foeman tamed,Forsaking me, thy friends and all,Why hast thou fled to Yáma hall?Why hast thou fled to taste no moreThe slaughtered foeman flesh and gore?Ah me, my life is done to-day:My better arm is lopped away.Whereon in danger I relied,And, fearless, Gods and fiends defied.How could a shaft from Ráma bowThe matchless giant overthrow,Whose iron frame so strong of yoreThe crushing bolt of Indra bore?This day the Gods and sages meetAnd triumph at their foe defeat.This day the Vánar chiefs will boastAnd, with new ardour fired, their hostIn fiercer onset will assailOur city, and the ramparts scale.What care I for a monarch name,For empire, or the Maithil dame?What joy can power and riches give,Or life that I should care to live,Unless this arm in mortal frayThe slayer of my brother slay?For me, of Kumbhakarna reft,Death is the only solace left;And I will seek, o\\'erwhelmed with woes,The realm to which my brother goes.Ah me ill-minded, not to takeHis counsel when Vibhishan spakeWhen he this evil day foretoldMy foolish heart was overbold:I drove my sage adviser hence,And reap the fruits of mine offence.\"Canto LXIX. Narántak Death.Pierced to the soul by sorrow stingThus wailed the evil-hearted king.Then Trisirás stood forth and cried:\"Yea, father, he has fought and died,Our bravest: and the loss is sore:But rouse thee, and lament no more.Hast thou not still thy coat of mail,Thy bow and shafts which never fail?A thousand asses draw thy carWhich roars like thunder heard afar.Thy valour and thy warrior skill,Thy God-given strength, are left thee still.Unarmed, thy matchless might subduedThe Gods and Dánav multitude.Armed with thy glorious weapons, howShall Raghu son oppose thee now?Or, sire, within thy palace stay;And I myself will sweep awayThy foes, like Garud when he makesA banquet of the writhing snakes.Soon Raghu son shall press the plain,As Narak(984) fell by Vishnu slain,Or Sambar(985) in rebellious prideWho met the King of Gods(986) and died.\"The monarch heard: his courage grew,And life and spirit came anew.Devántak and Narántak heard,And their fierce souls with joy were stirred;And Atikáya(987) burned to fight,And heard the summons with delight;While from the rest loud rang the cry,\"I too will fight,\" \"and I,\" \"and I.\"The joyous king his sons embraced,With gold and chains and jewels graced,And sent them forth with stirring speechOf benison and praise to each.Forth from the gate the princes spedAnd ranged for war the troops they led.The Vánar legions charged anew,And trees and rocks for missiles flew.They saw Narántak mighty formBorne on a steed that mocked the storm.To check his charge in vain they strove:Straight through their host his way he clove,As springs a dolphin through the tide:And countless Vánars fell and died,And mangled limbs and corpses layTo mark the chief ensanguined way,Sugríva saw them fall or flyWhen fierce Narántak steed was nigh,And marked the giant where he spedO\\'er heaps of dying or of dead.He bade the royal Angad faceThat bravest chief of giant race.As springs the sun from clouds dispersed,So Angad from the Vánars burst.No weapon for the fight he boreSave nails and teeth, and sought no more.\"Leave, giant chieftain,\" thus he spoke,\"Leave foes unworthy of thy stroke,And bend against a nobler heartThe terrors of thy deadly dart.\"Narántak heard the words he spake:Fast breathing, like an angry snake,With bloody teeth his lips he pressedAnd hurled his dart at Angad breast.True was the aim and fierce the stroke,Yet on his breast the missile broke.Then Angad at the giant flew,And with a blow his courser slew:The fierce hand crushed through flesh and bone,And steed and rider fell o\\'erthrown.Narántak eyes with fury blazed:His heavy hand on high he raisedAnd struck in savage wrath the headOf Báli son, who reeled and bled,Fainted a moment and no more:Then stronger, fiercer than beforeSmote with that fist which naught could stay,And crushed to death the giant lay.Canto LXX. The Death Of Trisirás.Then raged the Rákshas chiefs, and allBurned to avenge Narántak fall.Devántak raised his club on highAnd rushed at Angad with a cry.Behind came Trisirás, and nearMahodar charged with levelled spear.There Angad stood to fight with three:High o\\'er his head he waved a tree,And at Devántak, swift and trueAs Indra flaming bolt, it flew.But, cut by giant shafts in twain,With minished force it flew in vain.A shower of trees and blocks of stoneFrom Angad hand was fiercely thrown;But well his club Devántak pliedAnd turned each rock and tree aside.Nor yet, by three such foes assailed,The heart of Angad sank or quailed.He slew the mighty beast that boreMahodar: from his head he toreA bleeding tusk, and blow on blowFell fiercely on his Rákshas foe.The giant reeled, but strength regained,And furious strokes on Angad rained,Who, wounded by the storm of blows,Sank on his knees, but swiftly rose.Then Trisirás, as up he sprang,Drew his great bow with awful clang,And fixed three arrows from his sheafFull in the forehead of the chief.Hanúmán saw, nor long delayedTo speed with Níla to his aid,Who at the three-faced giant sentA peak from Lanká mountain rent.But Trisirás with certain aimShot rapid arrows as it came:And shivered by their force it brokeAnd fell to earth with flash and smoke.Then as the Wind-God son came nigh,Devántak reared his mace on high.Hanúmán smote him on the headAnd stretched the monstrous giant dead.Fierce Trisirás with fury strainedHis bow, and showers of arrows rainedThat smote on Níla side and chest:He sank a moment, sore distressed;But quickly gathered strength to seizeA mountain with its crown of trees.Crushed by the hill, distained with gore,Mahodar fell to rise no more.Then Trisirás raised high his spearWhich chilled the trembling foe with fearAnd, like a flashing meteor throughThe air at Hanúmán it flew.The Vánar shunned the threatened stroke,And with strong hands the weapon broke.The giant drew his glittering blade:Dire was the wound the weapon madeDeep in the Vánar ample chest,Who, for a moment sore oppressed,Raised his broad hand, regaining might,And struck the rover of the night.Fierce was the blow: with one wild yellLow on the earth the monster fell.Hanúmán seized his fallen swordWhich served no more its senseless lord,And from the monster triple-neckedSmote his huge heads with crowns bedecked.Then Mahápársva burned with ire;Fierce flashed his eyes with vengeful fire.A moment on the dead he gazed,Then his black mace aloft was raised,And down the mass of iron cameThat struck and shook the Vánar frame.Hanúmán chest was wellnigh crushed,And from his mouth red torrents gushed:Yet served one instant to restoreHis spirit: from the foe he toreHis awful mace, and smote, and laidThe giant in the dust dismayed.Crushed were his jaws and teeth and eyes:Breathless and still he lay as liesA summit from a mountain rentBy him who rules the firmament.Canto LXXI. Atikáya Death.But Atikáya wrath grew highTo see his noblest kinsmen die.He, fiercest of the giant race,Presuming still on Brahmá grace;Proud tamer of the Immortals\\' pride,Whose power and might with Indra vied,For blood and vengeful carnage burned,And on the foe his fury turned.High on a car that flashed and glowedBright as a thousand suns he rode.Around his princely brows was setA rich bejewelled coronet.Gold pendants in his ears he wore;He strained and tried the bow he bore,And ever, as a shaft he aimed,His name and royal race proclaimed.Scarce might the Vánars brook to hearHis clanging bow and voice of fear:To Raghu elder son they fled,Their sure defence in woe and dread.Then Ráma bent his eyes afarAnd saw the giant in his carFast following the flying crowdAnd roaring like a rainy cloud.He, with the lust of battle fired,Turned to Vibhishan and inquired:\"Say, who is this, of mountain size,This archer with the lion eyes?His car, which strikes our host with awe,A thousand eager coursers draw.Surrounded by the flashing spearsWhich line his car, the chief appearsLike some huge cloud when lightnings playAbout it on a stormy day;And the great bow he joys to holdWhose bended back is bright with gold,As Indra bow makes glad the skies,That best of chariots glorifies.O see the sunlike splendour flungFrom the great flag above him hung,Where, blazoned with refulgent lines,Ráhu(988) the dreadful Dragon shines.Full thirty quivers near his side,His car with shafts is well supplied:And flashing like the light of starsGleam his two mighty scimitars.Say, best of giants, who is heBefore whose face the Vánars flee?\"Thus Ráma spake. Vibhishan eyedThe giants\\' chief, and thus replied:\"This Ráma, this is Rávan son:High fame his youthful might has won.He, best of warriors, bows his earThe wisdom of the wise to hear.Supreme is he mid those who knowThe mastery of sword and bow.Unrivalled in the bold attackOn elephant or courser back,He knows, beside, each subtler art,To win the foe, to bribe, or part.On him the giant hosts rely,And fear no ill when he is nigh.This peerless chieftain bears the nameOf Atikáya huge of frame,Whom Dhanyamáliní of yoreTo Rávan lord of Lanká bore.\"Roused by his bow-string awful clang,To meet their foes the Vánars sprang.Armed with tall trees from Lanká wood,And rocks and mountain peaks, they stood.The giant arrows, gold-bedecked,The storm of hurtling missiles checked;And ever on his foemen pouredFierce tempest from his clanging cord;Nor could the Vánar chiefs sustainHis shafts\\' intolerable rain.They fled: the victor gained the placeWhere stood the lord of Raghu race,And cried with voice of thunder: \"Lo,Borne on my car, with shaft and bow,I, champion of the giants, scornTo fight with weaklings humbly born.Come forth your bravest, if he dare,And fight with one who will not spare.\"Forth sprang Sumitrá noble child,(989)And strained his ready bow, and smiled;And giants trembled as the clangThrough heaven and earth reëchoing rang.The giant to his string appliedA pointed shaft, and proudly cried;\"Turn, turn, Sumitrá son and fly,For terrible as Death am I.Fly, nor that youthful form oppose,Untrained in war, to warriors\\' blows.What! wilt thou waste thy childish breathAnd wake the dormant fire of death?Cast down, rash boy, that useless bow:Preserve thy life, uninjured go.\"He ceased: and stirred by wrath & prideSumitrá noble son replied:\"By warlike deed, not words alone,The valour of the brave is shown.Cease with vain boasts my scorn to move,And with thine arm thy prowess prove.Borne on thy car, with sword and bow,With all thine arms, thy valour show.Fight, and my deadly shafts this dayLow in the dust thy head shall lay,And, rushing fast in ceaseless flood,Shall rend thy flesh and drink thy blood.\"His giant foe no answer made,But on his string an arrow laid.He raised his arm, the cord he drew,At Lakshman breast the arrow flew.Sumitrá son, his foemen dread,Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,Which cleft that arrow pointed well,And harmless to the earth it fell.A shower of shafts from Lakshman bowFell fast and furious on the foeWho quailed not as the missiles smoteWith idle force his iron coat.Then came the friendly Wind-God near,And whispered thus in Lakshman ear:\"Such shafts as these in vain assailThy foe impenetrable mail.A more tremendous missile try,Or never may the giant die.Employ the mighty spell, and aimThe weapon known by Brahmá name.\"He ceased; Sumitrá son obeyed:On his great bow the shaft was laid,And with a roar like thunder, trueAs Indra flashing bolt, it flew.The giant poured his shafts like rainTo check its course, but all in vain.With spear and mace and sword he triedTo turn the fiery dart aside.Winged with a force which naught could check,It smote the monster in the neck,And, sundered from his shoulders, rolledTo earth his head and helm of gold.Canto LXXII. Rávan Speech.The giants bent, in rage and grief,Their eyes upon the fallen chief:Then flying wild with fear and paleTo Rávan bore the mournful tale.He heard how Atikáya died,Then turned him to his lords, and cried:\"Where are they now--my bravest--where,Wise to consult and prompt to dare?Where is Dhúmráksha, skilled to wieldAll weapons in the battle field?Akampan, and Prahasta might,And Kumbhakarna bold in fight?These, these and many a Rákshas more,Each master of the arms he bore,Who every foe in fight o\\'erthrew,The victors none could e\\'er subdue,Have perished by the might of one,The vengeful arm of Raghu son.In vain I cast mine eyes around,No match for Ráma here is found,No chief to stand before that bowWhose deadly shafts have caused our woe.Now, warriors, to your stations hence;Provide ye for the wall defence,And be the Asoka garden, whereThe lady lies, your special care.Be every lane and passage barred,Set at each gate a chosen guard.And with your troops, where danger calls,Be ready to defend the walls.Each movement of the Vánars mark;Observe them when the skies grow dark;Be ready in the dead of night,And ere the morning bring the light.Taught by our loss we may not scornThese legions of the forest-born.\"He ceased: the Rákshas lords obeyed;Each at his post his troops arrayed:And, torn with pangs that pierced him throughThe monarch from the hall withdrew.Canto LXXIII. Indrajít Victory.But Indrajít the fierce and boldWith words like these his sire consoled:\"Dismiss, O King, thy grief and dread,And be not thus disquieted.Against this numbing sorrow strive,For Indrajít is yet alive;And none in battle may withstandThe fury of his strong right hand.This day, O sire, thine eyes shall seeThe sons of Raghu slain by me.\"He ceased: he bade the king farewell:Clear, mid the roar of drum and shell,The clash of sword and harness rangAs to his car the warrior sprang.Close followed by his Rákshas trainThrough Lanká gate he reached the plain.Then down he leapt, and bade a bandOf giants by the chariot stand:Then with due rites, as rules require,Did worship to the Lord of Fire.The sacred oil, as texts ordain,With wreaths of scented flowers and grain,Within the flame in order due,That mightiest of the giants threw.There on the ground were spear and blade,And arrowy leaves and fuel laid;An iron ladle deep and wide,And robes with sanguine colours dyed.Beside him stood a sable goat:The giant seized it by the throat,And straight from the consuming flameAuspicious signs of victory came.For swiftly, curling to the right,The fire leapt up with willing lightUndimmed by smoky cloud, and, redLike gold, upon the offering fed.They brought him, while the flame yet glowed,The dart by Brahmá grace bestowed,And all the arms he wielded wellWere charmed with text and holy spell.Then fiercer for the fight he burned,And at the foe his chariot turned,While all his followers lifting highTheir maces charged with furious cry.Dire, yet more dire the battle grew,As rocks and trees and arrows flew.The giant shot his shafts like rain,And Vánars fell in myriads slain,Sugríva, Angad, Níla feltThe wounds his hurtling arrows dealt.His shafts the blood of Gaya drank;Hanúmán reeled and Mainda sank.Bright as the glances of the sunCame the swift darts they could not shun.Caught in the arrowy nets he wove,In vain the sons of Raghu strove;And Ráma, by the darts oppressed,His brother chieftain thus addressed:\"See, first this giant warrior sendsDestruction, mid our Vánar friends,And now his arrows thick and fastTheir binding net around us cast.To Brahmá grace the chieftain owesThe matchless power and might he shows;And mortal strength in vain contendsWith him whom Brahmá self befriends.Then let us still with dauntless heartsEndure this storm of pelting darts.Soon must we sink bereaved of sense;And then the victor, hurrying hence,Will seek his father in his hallAnd tell him of his foemen fall.\"He ceased: o\\'erpowered by shaft and spellThe sons of Raghu reeled and fell.The Rákshas on their bodies gazed;And, mid the shouts his followers raised,Sped back to Lanká to relateIn Rávan hall the princes\\' fate.Canto LXXIV. The Medicinal Herbs.The shades of falling night concealedThe carnage of the battle field,Which, bearing each a blazing brand,Hanúmán and Vibhishan scanned,Moving with slow and anxious treadAmong the dying and the dead.Sad was the scene of slaughter shownWhere\\'er the torches\\' light was thrown.Here mountain forms of Vánars layWhose heads and limbs were lopped away,Arms, legs and fingers strewed the ground,And severed heads lay thick around.The earth was moist with sanguine streams,And sighs were heard and groans and screams.There lay Sugríva still and cold,There Angad, once so brave and bold.There Jámbaván his might reposed,There Vegadarsí eyes were closed;There in the dust was Nala pride,And Dwivid lay by Mainda side.Where\\'er they looked the ensanguined plainWas strewn with myriads of the slain;(990)They sought with keenly searching eyesKing Jámbaván supremely wise.His strength had failed by slow decay,And pierced with countless shafts he lay.They saw, and hastened to his side,And thus the sage Vibhishan cried:\"Thee, monarch of the bears, we seek:Speak if thou yet art living, speak.\"Slow came the aged chief reply;Scarce could he say with many a sigh:\"Torn with keen shafts which pierce each limb,My strength is gone, my sight is dim;Yet though I scarce can raise mine eyes,Thy voice, O chief, I recognize.O, while these ears can hear thee, say,Has Hanúmán survived this day?\"\"Why ask,\" Vibhishan cried, \"for oneOf lower rank, the Wind-God son?Hast thou forgotten, first in place,The princely chief of Raghu race?Can King Sugríva claim no care,And Angad, his imperial heir?\"\"Yea, dearer than my noblest friendsIs he on whom our hope depends.For if the Wind-God son survive,All we though dead are yet alive.But if his precious life be fledThough living still we are but dead:He is our hope and sure relief.\"Thus slowly spoke the aged chief:Then to his side Hanúmán came,And with low reverence named his name.Cheered by the face he longed to viewThe wounded chieftain lived anew.\"Go forth,\" he cried, \"O strong and brave,And in their woe the Vánars save.No might but thine, supremely great,May help us in our lost estate.The trembling bears and Vánars cheer,Calm their sad hearts, dispel their fear.Save Raghu noble sons, and healThe deep wounds of the winged steel.High o\\'er the waters of the seaTo far Himálaya summits flee.Kailása there wilt thou behold,And Rishabh, with his peaks of gold.Between them see a mountain riseWhose splendour will enchant thine eyes;His sides are clothed above, below,With all the rarest herbs that grow.Upon that mountain lofty crestFour plants, of sovereign powers possessed,Spring from the soil, and flashing thereShed radiance through the neighbouring air.One draws the shaft: one brings againThe breath of life to warm the slain;One heals each wound; one gives anewTo faded cheeks their wonted hue.Fly, chieftain, to that mountain browAnd bring those herbs to save us now.\"Hanúmán heard, and springing throughThe air like Vishnu discus(991) flew.The sea was passed: beneath him, gayWith bright-winged birds, the mountains lay,And brook and lake and lonely glen,And fertile lands with toiling men.On, on he sped: before him roseThe mansion of perennial snows.There soared the glorious peaks as fairAs white clouds in the summer air.Here, bursting from the leafy shade,In thunder leapt the wild cascade.He looked on many a pure retreatDear to the Gods\\' and sages\\' feet:The spot where Brahmá dwells apart,The place whence Rudra launched his dart;(992)Vishnu high seat and Indra home,And slopes where Yáma servants roam.There was Kuvera bright abode;There Brahmá mystic weapon glowed.There was the noble hill whereonThose herbs with wondrous lustre shone,And, ravished by the glorious sight,Hanúmán rested on the height.He, moving down the glittering peak,The healing herbs began to seek:But, when he thought to seize the prize,They hid them from his eager eyes.Then to the hill in wrath he spake:\"Mine arm this day shall vengeance take,If thou wilt feel no pity, none,In this great need of Raghu son.\"He ceased: his mighty arms he bentAnd from the trembling mountain rentHis huge head with the life it bore,Snakes, elephants, and golden ore.O\\'er hill and plain and watery wasteHis rapid way again he traced.And mid the wondering Vánars laidHis burthen through the air conveyed,The wondrous herbs\\' delightful scentTo all the host new vigour lent.Free from all darts and wounds and painThe sons of Raghu lived again,And dead and dying Vánars healedRose vigorous from the battle field.Canto LXXV. The Night Attack.Sugríva spake in words like these:\"Now, Vánar lords, the occasion seize.For now, of sons and brothers reft,To Rávan little hope is left:And if our host his gates assailHis weak defence will surely fail.\"At dead of night the Vánar bandsRushed on with torches in their hands.Scared by the coming of the hostEach giant warder left his post.Where\\'er the Vánar legions cameTheir way was marked with hostile flameThat spread in fury to devourPalace and temple, gate and tower.Down came the walls and porches, downCame stately piles that graced the town.In many a house the fire was red,On sandal wood and aloe fed.And scorching flames in billows rolledO\\'er diamonds and pearls and gold.On cloth of wool, on silk brocade,On linen robes their fury preyed.Wheels, poles and yokes were burned, and allThe coursers\\' harness in the stall;And elephants\\' and chariots\\' gear,The sword, the buckler, and the spear.Scared by the crash of falling beams,Mid lamentations, groans and screams,Forth rushed the giants through the flamesAnd with them dragged bewildered dames,Each, with o\\'erwhelming terror wild,Still clasping to her breast a child.The swift fire from a cloud of smokeThrough many a gilded lattice broke,And, melting pearl and coral, roseO\\'er balconies and porticoes.The startled crane and peacock screamedAs with strange light the courtyard gleamed,And fierce unusual glare was thrownOn shrinking wood and heated stone.From burning stall and stable freedRushed frantic elephant and steed,And goaded by the driving blazeFled wildly through the crowded ways.As earth with fervent heat will glowWhen comes her final overthrow;From gate to gate, from court to spireProud Lanká was one blaze of fire,And every headland, rock and bayShone bright a hundred leagues away.Forth, blinded by the heat and flameRan countless giants huge of frame;And, mustering for fierce attack,The Vánars charged to drive them back,While shout and scream and roar and cryReëchoed through the earth and sky.There Ráma stood with strength renewed,And ever, as the foe he viewed,Shaking the distant regions rangHis mighty bow tremendous clang.Then through the gates Nikumbha hied,And Kumbha by his brother side,Sent forth--the bravest and the best--To battle by the king behest.There fought the chiefs in open field,And Angad fell and Dwivid reeled.Sugríva saw: by rage impelledHe crushed the bow which Kumbha held.About his foe Sugríva woundHis arms, and, heaving from the groundThe giant hurled him o\\'er the bank;And deep beneath the sea he sank.Like mandar hill with furious swellUp leapt the waters where he fell.Again he rose: he sprang to landAnd raised on high his threatening hand:Full on Sugríva chest it cameAnd shook the Vánar massy frame,But on the wounded bone he brokeHis wrist--so furious was the stroke.With force that naught could stay or check,Sugríva smote him neath the neck.The fierce blow crashed through flesh and boneAnd Kumbha lay in death o\\'erthrown.Nikumbha saw his brother die,And red with fury flashed his eye.He dashed with mighty sway and swingHis axe against the Vánar king;But shattered on that living rockIt split in fragments at the shock.Sugríva, rising to the blow,Raised his huge hand and smote his foe.And in the dust the giant layGasping in blood his soul away.[I have briefly despatched Kumbha and Nikumbha, each of whom has in thetext a long Canto to himself. When they fall Rávan sends forth Makarákshaor Crocodile-Eye, the son of Khara who was slain by Ráma in the forestbefore the abduction of Sítá. The account of his sallying forth, of hisbattle with Ráma and of his death by the fiery dart of that hero occupiestwo Cantos which I entirely pass over. Indrajít again comes forth and,rendered invisible by his magic art slays countless Vánars with hisunerring arrows. He retires to the city and returns bearing in his chariotan effigy of Sítá, the work of magic, weeping and wailing by his side. Hegrasps the lovely image by the hair and cuts it down with his scimitar inthe sight of the enraged Hanúmán and all the Vánar host. At last aftermuch fighting of the usual kind Indrajít chariot is broken in pieces,his charioteer is slain, and he himself falls by Lakshman hand, to theinexpressible delight of the high-souled saints, the nymphs of heaven andother celestial beings.]Canto XCIII. Rávan Lament.They sought the king, a mournful train,And cried, \"My lord, thy son is slain.By Lakshman hand, before these eyes,The warrior fell no more to rise.No time is this for vain regret:Thy hero son a hero met;And he whose might in battle pressedLord Indra and the Gods confessed,Whose power was stranger to defeat,Has gained in heaven a blissful seat.\"The monarch heard the mournful tale:His heart was faint, his cheek was pale;His fleeting sense at length regained,In trembling tones he thus complained:\"Ah me, my son, my pride: the boastAnd glory of the giant host.Could Lakshman puny might defeatThe foe whom Indra feared to meet?Could not thy deadly arrows splitProud Mandar peaks, O Indrajít,And the Destroyer self destroy?And wast thou conquered by a boy?I will not weep: thy noble deedHas blessed thee with immortal meedGained by each hero in the skiesWho fighting for his sovereign dies.Now, fearless of all meaner foes,The guardian Gods(993) will taste repose:But earth to me, with hill and plain,Is desolate, for thou art slain.Ah, whither hast thou fled, and leftThy mother, Lanká, me bereft;Left pride and state and wives behind,And lordship over all thy kind?I fondly hoped thy hand should payDue honours on my dying day:And couldst thou, O beloved, fleeAnd leave thy funeral rites to me?Life has no comfort left me, none,O Indrajít my son, my son.\"Thus wailed he broken by his woes:But swift the thought of vengeance rose.In awful wrath his teeth he gnashed,And from his eyes red lightning flashed.Hot from his mouth came fire and smoke,As thus the king in fury spoke:\"Through many a thousand years of yoreThe penance and the pain I bore,And by fierce torment well sustainedThe highest grace of Brahmá gained,His plighted word my life assured,From Gods of heaven and fiends secured.He armed my limbs with burnished mailWhose lustre turns the sunbeams pale,In battle proof gainst heavenly bandsWith thunder in their threatening hands.Armed in this mail myself will goWith Brahmá gift my deadly bow,And, cleaving through the foes my way,The slayers of my son will slay.\"Then, by his grief to frenzy wrought,The captive in the grove he sought.Swift through the shady path he sped:Earth trembled at his furious tread.Fierce were his eyes: his monstrous handHeld drawn for death his glittering brand.There weeping stood the Maithil dame:She shuddered as the giant came.Near drew the rover of the nightAnd raised his sword in act to smite;But, by his nobler heart impelled,One Rákshas lord his arm withheld:\"Wilt thou, great Monarch,\" thus he cried,\"Wilt thou, to heavenly Gods allied,Blot for all time thy glorious fame,The slayer of a gentle dame?What! shall a woman blood be spiltTo stain thee with eternal guilt,Thee deep in all the Veda lore?Far be the thought for evermore.Ah look, and let her lovely faceThis fury from thy bosom chase.\"He ceased: the prudent counsel pleasedThe monarch, and his wrath appeased;Then to his council hall in hasteThe giant lord his steps retraced.[I omit two Cantos in the first of which Ráma with an enchanted Gandharvaweapon deals destruction among the Rákshases sent out by Rávan, and in thesecond the Rákshas dames lament the slain and mourn over the madness ofRávan.]Canto XCVI. Rávan Sally.The groans and cries of dames who wailedThe ears of Lanká lord assailed,For from each house and home was sentThe voice of weeping and lament.In troubled thought his head he bowed,Then fiercely loosing on the crowdOf nobles near his throne he brokeThe silence, and in fury spoke:\"This day my deadly shafts shall fly,And Raghu sons shall surely die.This day shall countless Vánars bleedAnd dogs and kites and vultures feed.Go, bid them swift my car prepare,Bring the great bow I long to bear:And let my host with sword and shieldAnd spear be ready for the field.\"From street to street the captains passedAnd Rákshas warriors gathered fast.With spear and sword to pierce and strike,And axe and club and mace and pike.[I omit several weapons for which I cannot find distinctive names, andamong them the _Sataghní_ or _Centicide_, supposed by some to be a kind offire-arms or rocket, but described by a commentator on the Mahábhárata asa stone or cylindrical piece of wood studded with iron spikes.]Then Rávan warrior chariot(994) wroughtWith gold and rich inlay was brought.Mid tinkling bells and weapons\\' clangThe monarch on the chariot sprang,Which, decked with gems of every hue,Eight steeds of noble lineage drew.Mid roars of drum and shell rang outFrom countless throats a joyful shout.As, girt with hosts in warlike pride,Through Lanká streets the tyrant hied.Still, louder than the roar of drums,Went up the cry \"He comes, he comes,Our ever conquering lord who trodBeneath his feet both fiend and God.\"On to the gate the warriors sweptWhere Raghu sons their station kept.When Rávan car the portal passedThe sun in heaven was overcast.Earth rocked and reeled from side to sideAnd birds with boding voices cried.Against the standard of the kingA vulture flapped his horrid wing.Big gouts of blood before him dropped,His trembling steeds in terror stopped.The hue of death was on his cheek,And scarce his flattering tongue could speak,When, terrible with flash and flame,Through murky air a meteor came.Still by the hand of Death impelledHis onward way the giant held.The Vánars in the field afarHeard the loud thunder of his car.And turned with warriors\\' fierce delightTo meet the giant in the fight.He came: his clanging bow he drewAnd myriads of the Vánars slew.Some through the side and heart he cleft,Some headless on the plain were left.Some struggling groaned with mangled thighs,Or broken arms or blinded eyes.[I omit Cantos XCVII, XCVIII, and XCIX, which describe in the usual waythree single combats between Sugríva and Angad on the Vánar side andVirúpáksha, Mahodar, and Mahápársva on the side of the giants. The weaponsof the Vánars are trees and rocks; the giants fight with swords, axes, andbows and arrows. The details are generally the same as those of precedingduels. The giants fall, one in each Canto.]Canto C. Rávan In The Field.The plain with bleeding limbs was spread,And heaps of dying and of dead.His mighty bow still Ráma strained,And shafts upon the giants rained.Still Angad and Sugríva, wroughtTo fury, for the Vánars fought.Crushed with huge rocks through chest and sideMahodar, Mahápársva died,And Virúpáksha stained with goreDropped on the plain to rise no more.When Rávan saw the three o\\'erthrownHe cried aloud in furious tone:\"Urge, urge the car, my charioteer,The haughty Vánars\\' death is near.This very day shall end our griefsFor leaguered town and slaughtered chiefs.Ráma the tree whose lovely fruitIs Sítá, shall this arm uproot,--Whose branches with protecting shadeAre Vánar lords who lend him aid.\"Thus cried the king: the welkin rangAs forth the eager coursers sprang,And earth beneath the chariot shookWith flowery grove and hill and brook.Fast rained his shafts: where\\'er he spedThe conquered Vánars fell or fled,On rolled the car in swift careerTill Raghu noble sons were near.Then Ráma looked upon the foeAnd strained and tried his sounding bow,Till earth and all the region rangRe-echoing to the awful clang.His bow the younger chieftain bent,And shaft on shaft at Rávan sent.He shot: but Rávan little recked;Each arrow with his own he checked,And headless, baffled of its aim,To earth the harmless missile came;And Lakshman stayed his arm o\\'erpoweredBy the thick darts the giant showered.Fierce waxed the fight and fiercer yet,For Rávan now and Ráma met,And each on other poured amainThe tempest of his arrowy rain.While all the sky above was darkWith missiles speeding to their markLike clouds, with flashing lightning twinedAbout them, hurried by the wind.Not fiercer was the wondrous fightWhen Vritra fell by Indra might.All arts of war each foeman knew,And trained alike, his bowstring drew.Red-eyed with fury Lanká kingPressed his huge fingers on the string,And fixed in Ráma brows a flightOf arrows winged with matchless flight.Still Raghu son endured, and boreThat crown of shafts though wounded sore.O\\'er a dire dart a spell he spokeWith mystic power to aid the stroke.In vain upon the foe it smoteRebounding from the steelproof coat.The giant armed his bow anew,And wondrous weapons hissed and flew,Terrific, deadly, swift of flight,Beaked like the vulture and the kite,Or bearing heads of fearful make,Of lion, tiger, wolf and snake.(995)Then Ráma, troubled by the stormOf flying darts in every formShot by an arm that naught could tire,Launched at the foe his dart of fire,Which, sacred to the Lord of Flame,Burnt and consumed where\\'er it came.And many a blazing shaft besideThe hero to his string applied.With fiery course of dazzling hueSwift to the mark each missile flew,Some flashing like a shooting star,Some as the tongues of lightning are;One like a brilliant plant, oneIn splendour like the morning sun.Where\\'er the shafts of Ráma burnedThe giant darts were foiled and turned.Far into space his weapons fled,But as they flew struck thousands dead.Canto CI. Lakshman Fall.When Rávan saw his darts repelled,With double rage his bosom swelled.He summoned, wroth but undismayed,A mightier charm to lend its aid.And, fierce as fire before the blast,A storm of missiles thick and fast,Spear, pike and javelin, mace and brand,Came hurtling from the giant hand.But, mightier still, the arms employedBy Raghu son their force destroyed,And every dart fell dulled and spentBy powers the bards of heaven had lent.With his huge mace Vibhishan slewThe steeds that Rávan chariot drew.Then Rávan hurled in deadly ireA ponderous spear that flashed like fire:But Ráma arrows checked its way,And harmless on the earth it lay,The giant seized a mightier spear,Which Death himself would shun with fear.Vibhishan with the stroke had died,But Lakshman hand his bowstring plied,And flying arrows thick as hailSmote fiercely on the giant mail.Then Rávan turned his aim aside,On Lakshman looked and fiercely cried:\"Thou, thou again my wrath hast braved,And from his death Vibhishan saved.Now in his stead this spear receiveWhose deadly point thy heart shall cleave.\"He ceased: he hurled the mortal dartBy Maya forged with magic art.The spear, with all his fury flung,Swift, flickering like a serpent tongue,Adorned with many a tinkling bell,Smote Lakshman, and the hero fell.When Ráma saw, he heaved a sigh,A tear one moment dimmed his eye.But tender grief was soon repressedAnd thoughts of vengeance filled his breast.The air around him flashed and gleamedAs from his bow the arrows streamed;And Lanká lord, the foeman dread,O\\'erwhelmed with terror turned and fled.Canto CII. Lakshman Healed.But Ráma, pride of Raghu race,Gazed tenderly on Lakshman face,And, as the sight his spirit broke,Turned to Sushen and sadly spoke:\"Where is my power and valour? howShall I have heart for battle now,When dead before my weeping eyesMy brother, noblest Lakshman, lies?My tears in blinding torrents flow,My hand unnerved has dropped my bow.The pangs of woe have blanched my cheek,My heart is sick, my strength is weak.Ah me, my brother! Ah, that IBy Lakshman side might sink and die:Life, war and conquest, all are vainIf Lakshman lies in battle slain.Why will those eyes my glances shun?Hast thou no word of answer, none?Ah, is thy noble spirit flownAnd gone to other worlds alone?Couldst thou not let thy brother seekThose worlds with thee? O speak, O speak!Rise up once more, my brother, rise,Look on me with thy loving eyes.Were not thy steps beside me stillIn gloomy wood, on breezy hill?Did not thy gentle care assuageThy brother grief and fitful rage?Didst thou not all his troubles share,His guide and comfort in despair?\"As Ráma, vanquished, wept and sighedThe Vánar chieftain thus replied:\"Great Prince, unmanly thoughts dismiss,Nor yield thy soul to grief like this.In vain those burning tears are shed:Our glory Lakshman is not dead.Death on his brow no mark has set,Where beauty lustre lingers yet.Clear is the skin, and tender huesOf lotus flowers his palms suffuse.O Ráma, cheer thy trembling heart;Not thus do life and body part.Now, Hanumán, to thee I speak:Hie hence to tall Mahodaya(996) peakWhere herbs of sovereign virtue growWhich life and health and strength bestowBring thou the leaves to balm his pain,And Lakshman shall be well again.\"He ceased: the Wind-God son obeyedSwift through the clouds his way he made.He reached the hill, nor stayed to findThe wondrous herbs of healing kind,From its broad base the mount he toreWith all the shrubs and trees it bore,Sped through the clouds again and showedTo wise Sushen his woody load.(997)Sushen in wonder viewed the hill,And culled the sovereign salve of ill.Soon as the healing herb he found,The fragrant leaves he crushed and ground.Then over Lakshman face he bent,Who, healed and strengthened by the scentOf that blest herb divinely sweet,Rose fresh and lusty on his feet.Canto CIII. Indra Car.Then Raghu son forgot his woe:Again he grasped his fallen bowAnd hurled at Lanká lord amainThe tempest of his arrowy rain.Drawn by the steeds his lords had brought,Again the giant turned and fought.And drove his glittering chariot nighAs springs the Day-God through the sky.Then, as his sounding bow he bent,Like thunderbolts his shafts were sent,As when dark clouds in rain time shedFierce torrents on a mountain head.High on his car the giant rode,On foot the son of Raghu strode.The Gods from their celestial heightIndignant saw the unequal fight.Then he whom heavenly hosts revere,Lord Indra, called his charioteer:\"Haste, Mátali,\" he cried, \"descend;To Raghu son my chariot lend.With cheering words the chief address;And all the Gods thy deed will bless.\"He bowed; he brought the glorious carWhose tinkling bells were heard afar;Fair as the sun of morning, brightWith gold and pearl and lazulite.He yoked the steeds of tawny hueThat swifter than the tempest flew.Then down the slope of heaven he hiedAnd stayed the car by Ráma side.\"Ascend, O Chief,\" he humbly cried,\"The chariot which the Gods provide.The mighty bow of Indra see,Sent by the Gods who favour thee;Behold this coat of glittering mail,And spear and shafts which never fail.\"Cheered by the grace the Immortals showedThe chieftain on the chariot rode.Then as the car-borne warriors metThe awful fight raged fiercer yet.Each shaft that Rávan shot becameA serpent red with kindled flame,And round the limbs of Ráma hungWith fiery jaws and quivering tongue.But every serpent fled dismayedWhen Raghu valiant son displayedThe weapon of the Feathered King,(998)And loosed his arrows from the string.But Rávan armed his bow anew,And showers of shafts at Ráma flew,While the fierce king in swift careerSmote with a dart the charioteer.An arrow shot by Rávan handLaid the proud banner on the sand,And Indra steeds of heavenly strainFell by the iron tempest slain.On Gods and spirits of the airFell terror, trembling, and despair.The sea white billows mounted highWith froth and foam to drench the sky.The sun by lurid clouds was veiled,The friendly lights of heaven were paled;And, fiercely gleaming, fiery MarsOpposed the beams of gentler stars.Then Ráma eyes with fury blazedAs Indra heavenly spear he raised.Loud rang the bells: the glistering headBright flashes through the region shed.Down came the spear in swift descent:The giant lance was crushed and bent.Then Rávan horses brave and fleetFell dead beneath his arrowy sleet.Fierce on his foeman Ráma pressed,And gored with shafts his mighty breast.And spouting streams of crimson dyedThe weary giant limbs and side.[I omit Cantos CIV and CV in which the fight is renewed and Rávan severelyreprimands his charioteer for timidity and want of confidence in hismaster prowess, and orders him to charge straight at Ráma on the nextoccasion.]Canto CVI. Glory To The Sun.There faint and bleeding fast, apartStood Rávan raging in his heart.Then, moved with ruth for Ráma sake,Agastya(999) came and gently spake:\"Bend, Ráma, bend thy heart and earThe everlasting truth to hearWhich all thy hopes through life will blessAnd crown thine arms with full success.The rising sun with golden rays,Light of the worlds, adore and praise:The universal king, the lordBy hosts of heaven and fiends adored.He tempers all with soft control,He is the Gods\\' diviner soul;And Gods above and fiends belowAnd men to him their safety owe.He Brahmá, Vishnu, Siva, heEach person of the glorious Three,Is every God whose praise we tell,The King of Heaven,(1000) the Lord of Hell:(1001)Each God revered from times of old,The Lord of War,(1002) the King of Gold:(1003)Mahendra, Time and Death is he,The Moon, the Ruler of the Sea.(1004)He hears our praise in every form,--The manes,(1005) Gods who ride the storm,(1006)The Asvins,(1007) Manu,(1008) they who standRound Indra,(1009) and the Sádhyas\\'(1010) bandHe is the air, and life and fire,The universal source and sire:He brings the seasons at his call,Creator, light, and nurse of all.His heavenly course he joys to run,Maker of Day, the golden sun.The steeds that whirl his car are seven,(1011)The flaming steeds that flash through heaven.Lord of the sky, the conqueror partsThe clouds of night with glistering darts.He, master of the Vedas\\' lore,Commands the clouds\\' collected store:He is the rivers\\' surest friend;He bids the rains, and they descend.Stars, planets, constellations ownTheir monarch of the golden throne.Lord of twelve forms,(1012) to thee I bow,Most glorious King of heaven art thou.O Ráma, he who pays arightDue worship to the Lord of LightShall never fall oppressed by ill,But find a stay and comfort still.Adore with all thy heart and mindThis God of Gods, to him resigned;And thou his saving power shalt knowVictorious o\\'er thy giant foe.\"[This Canto does not appear in the Bengal recension. It comes in awkwardlyand may I think be considered as an interpolation, but I paraphrase aportion of it as a relief after so much fighting and carnage, and as aninteresting glimpse of the monotheistic ideas which underlie the Hindureligion.

The Battle.He spoke, and vanished: Ráma raisedHis eyes with reverence meet, and praisedThe glorious Day-God full in view:Then armed him for the fight anew.Urged onward by his charioteerThe giant foaming steeds came near,And furious was the battle dinWhere each resolved to die or win.The Rákshas host and Vánar bandsStood with their weapons in their hands,And watched in terror and dismayThe fortune of the awful fray.The giant chief with rage inflamedHis darts at Ráma pennon aimed;But when they touched the chariot madeBy heavenly hands their force was stayed.Then Ráma breast with fury swelled;He strained the mighty bow he held,And straight at Rávan banner flewAn arrow as the string he drew--A deadly arrow swift of flight,Like some huge snake ablaze with light,Whose fury none might e\\'er repel,--And, split in twain, the standard fell.At Ráma steeds sharp arrows, hotWith flames of fire, the giant shot.Unmoved the heavenly steeds sustainedThe furious shower the warrior rained,As though soft lotus tendrils smoteEach haughty crest and glossy coat.Then volleyed swift by magic art,Tree, mountain peak and spear and dart,Trident and pike and club and maceFlew hurtling straight at Ráma face.But Ráma with his steeds and carEscaped the storm which fell afarWhere the strange missiles, as they rushedTo earth, a thousand Vánars crushed.Canto CIX. The Battle.With wondrous power and might and skillThe giant fought with Ráma still.Each at his foe his chariot drove,And still for death or victory strove.The warriors\\' steeds together dashed,And pole with pole reëchoing clashed.Then Ráma launching dart on dartMade Rávan coursers swerve and start.Nor was the lord of Lanká slowTo rain his arrows on the foe,Who showed, by fiery points assailed,No trace of pain, nor shook nor quailed.Dense clouds of arrows Ráma shotWith that strong arm which rested not,And spear and mace and club and brandFell in dire rain from Rávan hand.The storm of missiles fiercely castStirred up the oceans with its blast,And Serpent-Gods and fiends who dwellBelow were troubled by the swell.The earth with hill and plain and brookAnd grove and garden reeled and shook:The very sun grew cold and pale,And horror stilled the rising gale.God and Gandharva, sage and saintCried out, with grief and terror faint:\"O may the prince of Raghu lineGive peace to Bráhmans and to kine,And, rescuing the worlds, o\\'erthrowThe giant king our awful foe.\"Then to his deadly string the prideOf Raghu race a shaft applied.Sharp as a serpent venomed fangStraight to its mark the arrow sprang,And from the giant body shredWith trenchant steel the monstrous head.There might the triple world beholdThat severed head adorned with gold.But when all eyes were bent to view,Swift in its stead another grew.Again the shaft was pointed well:Again the head divided fell;But still as each to earth was castAnother head succeeded fast.A hundred, bright with fiery flame,Fell low before the victor aim,Yet Rávan by no sign betrayedThat death was near or strength decayed.The doubtful fight he still maintained,And on the foe his missiles rained.In air, on earth, on plain, on hill,With awful might he battled still;And through the hours of night and dayThe conflict knew no pause or stay.Canto CX. Rávan Death.Then Mátali to Ráma cried:\"Let other arms the day decide.Why wilt thou strive with useless toilAnd see his might thy efforts foil?Launch at the foe thy dart whose fireWas kindled by the Almighty Sire.\"He ceased: and Raghu son obeyed:Upon his string the hero laidAn arrow, like a snake that hissed.Whose fiery flight had never missed:The arrow Saint Agastya gaveAnd blessed the chieftain life to saveThat dart the Eternal Father madeThe Monarch of the Gods to aid;By Brahmá self on him bestowedWhen forth to fight Lord Indra rode.\\'Twas feathered with the rushing wind;The glowing sun and fire combinedTo the keen point their splendour lent;The shaft, ethereal element,By Meru hill and Mandar, prideOf mountains, had its weight supplied.He laid it on the twisted cord,He turned the point at Lanká lord,And swift the limb-dividing dartPierced the huge chest and cleft the heart,And dead he fell upon the plainLike Vritra by the Thunderer slain.The Rákahas host when Rávan fellSent forth a wild terrific yell,Then turned and fled, all hope resigned,Through Lanká gates, nor looked behind.His voice each joyous Vánar raised,And Ráma, conquering Ráma, praised.Soft from celestial minstrels cameThe sound of music and acclaim.Soft, fresh, and cool, a rising breezeBrought odours from the heavenly trees,And ravishing the sight and smellA wondrous rain of blossoms fell:And voices breathed round Raghu son:\"Champion of Gods, well done, well done.\"Canto CXI. Vibhishan Lament.Vibhishan saw his brother slain,Nor could his heart its woe contain.O\\'er the dead king he sadly bentAnd mourned him with a loud lament:\"O hero, bold and brave,\" he cried,\"Skilled in all arms, in battle tried.Spoiled of thy crown, with limbs outspread,Why wilt thou press thy gory bed?Why slumber on the earth cold breast,When sumptuous couches woo to rest?Ah me, my brother over bold,Thine is the fate my heart foretold:But love and pride forbade to hearThe friend who blamed thy wild career.Fallen is the sun who gave us light,Our lordly moon is veiled in night.Our beacon fire is dead and coldA hundred waves have o\\'er it rolled.What could his light and fire availAgainst Lord Ráma arrowy hail?Woe for the giants\\' royal tree,Whose stately height was fair to see.His buds were deeds of kingly grace,His bloom the sons who decked his race.With rifled bloom and mangled boughThe royal tree lies prostrate now.\"\"Nay, idly mourn not,\" Ráma cried,\"The warrior king has nobly died,Intrepid hero, firm through all,So fell he as the brave should fall;And ill beseems it chiefs like usTo weep for those who perish thus.Be firm: thy causeless grief restrain,And pay the dues that yet remain.\"Again Vibhishan sadly spoke:\"His was the hero arm that brokeEmbattled Gods\\' and Indra might,Unconquered ere to-day in fight.He rushed against thee, fought and fell,As Ocean, when his waters swell,Hurling his might against a rock,Falls spent and shattered by the shock.Woe for our king untimely end,The generous lord the trusty friend:Our sure defence when fear arose,A dreaded scourge to stubborn foes.O, let the king thy hand has slainThe honours of the dead obtain.\"Then Ráma answered. \"Hatred diesWhen low in dust the foeman lies.Now triumph bids the conflict cease,And knits us in the bonds of peace.Let funeral rites be duly paid.And be it mine thy toil to aid.\"Canto CXII. The Rákshas Dames.High rose the universal wailThat mourned the monarch death, and, paleWith crushing woe, her hair unbound,Her eyes in floods of sorrow drowned,Forth from the inner chambers cameWith trembling feet each royal dame,Heedless of those who bade them stayThey reached the field where Rávan lay;There falling by their husband side,\"Ah, King! ah dearest lord!\" they cried.Like creepers shattered by the stormThey threw them on his mangled form.One to his bleeding bosom creptAnd lifted up her voice and wept.About his feet one mourner clung,Around his neck another hung,One on the giant severed head,Her pearly tears in torrents shedFast as the drops the summer showerPours down upon the lotus flower.\"Ah, he whose arm in anger rearedThe King of Gods and Yáma feared,While panic struck their heavenly train,Lies prostrate in the battle slain.Thy haughty heart thou wouldst not bend,Nor listen to each wiser friend.Ah, had the dame, as they implored,Been yielded to her injured lord,We had not mourned this day thy fall,And happy had it been for all.Then Ráma and thy friends contentIn blissful peace their days had spent.Thine injured brother had not fled,Nor giant chiefs and Vánars bled.Yet for these woes we will not blame.Thy fancy for the Maithil dame,Fate, ruthless Fate, whom none may bendHas urged thee to thy hapless end.\"Canto CXIII. Mandodarí Lament.While thus they wept, supreme in place,The loveliest for form and face,Mandodarí drew near alone,Looked on her lord and made her moan:\"Ah Monarch, Indra feared to standIn fight before thy conquering hand.From thy dread spear the Immortals ran;And art thou murdered by a man?Ah, \\'twas no child of earth, I know,That smote thee with that mortal blow.\\'Twas Death himself in Ráma shape,That slew thee: Death whom none escape.Or was it he who rules the skiesWho met thee, clothed in man disguise?Ah no, my lord, not Indra: heIn battle ne\\'er could look on thee.One only God thy match I deem:\\'Twas Vishnu self, the Lord Supreme,Whose days through ceaseless time extendAnd ne\\'er began and ne\\'er shall end:He with the discus, shell, and mace,Brought ruin on the giant race.Girt by the Gods of heaven arrayedLike Vánar hosts his strength to aid,He Ráma shape and arms assumedAnd slew the king whom Fate had doomed.In Janasthán when Khara diedWith giant legions by his side,No mortal was the unconquered foeIn Ráma form who struck the blow.When Hanumán the Vanár cameAnd burnt thy town with hostile flame,I counselled peace in anxious fear:I counselled, but thou wouldst not hear.Thy fancy for the foreign dameHas brought thee death and endless shame.Why should thy foolish fancy roam?Hadst thou not wives as fair at home?In beauty, form and grace could she,Dear lord, surpass or rival me?Now will the days of Sítá glideIn tranquil joy by Ráma side:And I--ah me, around me ravesA sea of woe with whelming waves.With thee in days of old I trodEach spot beloved by nymph and God;I stood with thee in proud delightOn Mandar side and Meru height;With thee, my lord, enchanted strayedIn Chaitraratha(1013) lovely shade,And viewed each fairest scene afarTransported in thy radiant car.But source of every joy wast thou,And all my bliss is ended now.\"Then Ráma to Vibhishan cried:\"Whate\\'er the ritual bids, provide.Obsequial honours duly pay,And these sad mourners\\' grief allay.\"Vibhishan answered, wise and true,For duty changeless law he knew:\"Nay one who scorned all sacred vowsAnd dared to touch another spouse,Fell tyrant of the human race,With funeral rites I may not grace.\"Him Raghu royal son, the bestOf those who love the law, addressed:\"False was the rover of the night,He loved the wrong and scorned the right.Yet for the fallen warrior pleadThe dauntless heart, the valorous deed.Let him who ne\\'er had brooked defeat,The chief whom Indra feared to meet,The ever-conquering lord, obtainThe honours that should grace the slain.\"Vibhishan bade his friends prepareThe funeral rites with thoughtful care.Himself the royal palace soughtWhence sacred fire was quickly brought,With sandal wood and precious scentsAnd pearl and coral ornaments.Wise Bráhmans, while the tears that flowedDown their wan cheeks their sorrow sowed,Upon a golden litter laidThe corpse in finest ropes arrayed.Thereon were flowers and pennons hung,And loud the monarch praise was sung.Then was the golden litter raised,While holy fire in order blazed.And first in place Vibhishan ledThe slow procession of the dead,Behind, their cheeks with tears bedewed,Came sad the widowed multitude.Where, raised as Bráhmans ordered, stoodPiled sandal logs, and scented wood,The body of the king was setHigh on a deerskin coverlet.Then duly to the monarch shadeThe offerings for the dead they paid,And southward on the eastern sideAn altar formed and fire supplied.Then on the shoulder of the deadThe oil and clotted milk were shed.All rites were done as rules ordain:The sacrificial goat was slain.Next on the corpse were perfumes thrownAnd many a flowery wreath was strown;And with Vibhishan ready aidRich vesture o\\'er the king was laid.Then while the tears their cheeks bedewedParched grain upon the dead they strewed;Last, to the wood, as rules require,Vibhishan set the kindling fire.Then having bathed, as texts ordain,To Lanká went the mourning train.Vibhishan, when his task was done,Stood by the side of Raghu son.And Ráma, freed from every foe,Unstrung at last his deadly bow,And laid the glittering shafts aside,And mail by Indra love supplied.Canto CXIV. Vibhishan Consecrated.Joy reigned in heaven where every eyeHad seen the Lord of Lanká die.In cars whose sheen surpassed the sunTriumphant rode the radiant ones:And Rávan death, by every tongue,And Ráma glorious deeds were sung.They praised the Vánars true and brave,The counsel wise Sugríva gave.The deeds of Hanúmán they told,The valiant chief supremely bold,The strong ally, the faithful friend,And Sítá truth which naught could bend.To Mátali, whom Indra sent,His head the son of Raghu bent:And he with fiery steeds who cloveThe clouds again to Swarga drove.Round King Sugríva brave and trueHis arms in rapture Ráma threw,Looked on the host with joy and pride,And thus to noble Lakshman cried:\"Now let king-making drops be shed,Dear brother, on Vibhishan headFor truth and friendship nobly shown,And make him lord of Rávan throne.\"This longing of his heart he told:And Lakshman took an urn of goldAnd bade the wind-fleet Vánars bringSea water for the giants\\' king.The brimming urn was swiftly brought:Then on a throne superbly wroughtVibhishan sat, the giants\\' lord,And o\\'er his brows the drops were poured.As Raghu son the rite beheldHis loving heart with rapture swelled:But tenderer thoughts within him woke,And thus to Hanúmán he spoke:\"Go to my queen: this message give:Say Lakshman and Sugríva live.The death of Lanká monarch tell,And bid her joy, for all is well.\"Canto CXV. Sítá Joy.The Vánar chieftain bowed his head,Within the walls of Lanká sped,Leave from the new-made king obtained,And Sítá lovely garden gained.Beneath a tree the queen he found,Where Rákshas warders watched around.Her pallid cheek, her tangled hair,Her raiment showed her deep despair,Near and more near the envoy cameAnd gently hailed the weeping dame.She started up in sweet surprise,And sudden joy illumed her eyes.For well the Vánar voice she knew,And hope reviving sprang and grew.\"Fair Queen,\" he said, \"our task is done:The foe is slain and Lanká won.Triumphant mid triumphant friendsKind words of greeting Ráma sends.\"Blest for thy sake, O spouse most true,My deadly foe I met and slew.Mine eyes are strangers yet to sleep:I built a bridge athwart the deepAnd crossed the sea to Lanká shoreTo keep the mighty oath I swore.Now, gentle love, thy cares dispel,And weep no more, for all is well.Fear not in Rávan house to stayFor good Vibhishan now bears sway,For constant truth and friendship knownRegard his palace as thine own.\"He greets thee thus thy heart to cheer,And urged by love will soon be here.\"Then flushed with joy the lady cheek.Her eyes o\\'erflowed, her voice was weak;But struggling with her sobs she brokeHer silence thus, and faintly spoke:\"So fast the flood of rapture came,My trembling tongue no words could frame.Ne\\'er have I heard in days of blissA tale that gave such joy as this.More precious far than gems and goldThe message which thy lips have told.\"His reverent hands the Vánar raisedAnd thus the lady answer praised:\"Sweet are the words, O Queen, which thouTrue to thy lord, hast spoken now,Better than gems and pearls of price,Yea, or the throne of Paradise.But, lady, ere I leave this place,Grant me, I pray, a single grace.Permit me, and this vengeful handShall slay thy guards, this Rákshas band,Whose cruel insult threat and scornThy gentle soul too long has borne.\"Thus, stern of mood, Hanúmán cried:The Maithil lady thus replied:\"Nay, be not wroth with servants: they,When monarchs bid must needs obey.And, vassals of their lords, fulfilEach fancy of their sovereign will.To mine own sins the blame impute,For as we sow we reap the fruit.The tyrant will these dames obeyedWhen their fierce threats my soul dismayed.\"She ceased: with admiration movedThe Vánar chief her words approved:\"Thy speech,\" he cried, \"is worthy oneWhom love has linked to Raghu son.Now speak, O Queen, that I may knowThy pleasure, for to him I go.\"The Vánar ceased: then Janak childMade answer as she sweetly smiled:\"\\'My first, my only wish can be,O chief, my loving lord to see.\"Again the Vánar envoy spoke,And with his words new rapture woke:\"Queen, ere this sun shall cease to shineThy Ráma eyes shall look in thine.Again the lord of Raghu raceShall turn to thee his moon-bright face.His faithful brother shall thou seeAnd every friend who fought for thee,And greet once more thy king restoredLike Sachí(1014) to her heavenly lord.\"To Raghu son his steps he bentAnd told the message that she sent.Canto CXVI. The Meeting.He looked upon that archer chiefWhose full eye mocked the lotus leaf,And thus the noble Vánar spake:\"Now meet the queen for whose dear sakeThy mighty task was first begun,And now the glorious fruit is won.O\\'erwhelmed with woe thy lady lies,The hot tears streaming from her eyes.And still the queen must long and pineUntil those eyes be turned to thine.\"But Ráma stood in pensive mood,And gathering tears his eyes bedewed.His sad looks sought the ground: he sighedAnd thus to King Vibhishan cried:\"Let Sítá bathe and tire her headAnd hither to my sight be ledIn raiment sweet with precious scent,And gay with golden ornament.\"The Rákshas king his palace sought,And Sítá from her bower was brought.Then Rákshas bearers tall and strong,Selected from the menial throng,Through Lanká gate the queen, arrayedIn glorious robes and gems, conveyed.Concealed behind the silken screen,Swift to the plain they bore the queen,While Vánars, close on every side,With eager looks the litter eyed.The warders at Vibhishan hestThe onward rushing throng repressed,While like the roar of ocean loudRose the wild murmur of the crowd.The son of Raghu saw and movedWith anger thus the king reproved:\"Why vex with hasty blow and threatThe Vánars, and my rights forget?Repress this zeal, untimely shown:I count this people as mine own.A woman guard is not her bower,The lofty wall, the fenced tower:Her conduct is her best defence,And not a king magnificence.At holy rites, in war and woe,Her face unveiled a dame may show;When at the Maiden Choice(1015) they meet,When marriage troops parade the street.And she, my queen, who long has lainIn prison racked with care and pain,May cease a while her face to hide,For is not Ráma by her side?Lay down the litter: on her feetLet Sítá come her lord to meet.And let the hosts of woodland raceLook near upon the lady face.\"Then Lakshman and each Vánar chiefWho heard his words were filled with grief.The lady gentle spirit sank,And from each eye in fear she shrank,As, her sweet eyelids veiled for shame,Slowly before her lord she came.While rapture battled with surpriseShe raised to his her wistful eyes.Then with her doubt and fear she strove,And from her breast all sorrow drove.Regardless of the gathering crowd,Bright as the moon without a cloud,She bent her eyes, no longer dim,In joy and trusting love on him.Canto CXVII. Sítá Disgrace.He saw her trembling by his side,And looked upon her face and cried:\"Lady, at length my task is done,And thou, the prize of war, art won,This arm my glory has retrieved,And all that man might do achieved;The insulting foe in battle slainAnd cleared mine honour from its stain.This day has made my name renownedAnd with success my labour crowned.Lord of myself, the oath I sworeIs binding on my soul no more.If from my home my queen was reft,This arm has well avenged the theft,And in the field has wiped awayThe blot that on mine honour lay.The bridge that spans the foaming flood,The city red with giants\\' blood;The hosts by King Sugríva ledWho wisely counselled, fought and bled;Vibhishan love, our guide and stay--All these are crowned with fruit to-day.But, lady, \\'twas not love for theeThat led mine army o\\'er the sea.\\'Twas not for thee our blood was shed,Or Lanká filled with giant dead.No fond affection for my wifeInspired me in the hour of strife.I battled to avenge the causeOf honour and insulted laws.My love is fled, for on thy fameLies the dark blot of sin and shame;And thou art hateful as the lightThat flashes on the injured sight.The world is all before thee: flee:Go where thou wilt, but not with me.How should my home receive againA mistress soiled with deathless stain?How should I brook the foul disgrace,Scorned by my friends and all my race?For Rávan bore thee through the sky,And fixed on thine his evil eye.About thy waist his arms he threw,Close to his breast his captive drew,And kept thee, vassal of his power,An inmate of his ladies\\' bower.\"Canto CXVIII. Sítá Reply.Struck down with overwhelming shameShe shrank within her trembling frame.Each word of Ráma like a dartHad pierced the lady to the heart;And from her sweet eyes unrestrainedThe torrent of her sorrows, rained.Her weeping eyes at length she dried,And thus mid choking sobs replied:\"Canst thou, a high-born prince, dismissA high-born dame with speech like this?Such words befit the meanest hind,Not princely birth and generous mind,By all my virtuous life I swearI am not what thy words declare.If some are faithless, wilt thou findNo love and truth in womankind?Doubt others if thou wilt, but ownThe truth which all my life has shown.If, when the giant seized his prey,Within his hated arms I lay,And felt the grasp I dreaded, blameFate and the robber, not thy dame.What could a helpless woman do?My heart was mine and still was true,Why when Hanúmán sent by theeSought Lanká town across the sea,Couldst thou not give, O lord of men,Thy sentence of rejection then?Then in the presence of the chiefDeath, ready death, had brought relief,Nor had I nursed in woe and painThis lingering life, alas in vain.Then hadst thou shunned the fruitless strifeNor jeopardied thy noble life,But spared thy friends and bold alliesTheir vain and weary enterprise.Is all forgotten, all? my birth,Named Janak child, from fostering earth?That day of triumph when a maidMy trembling hand in thine I laid?My meek obedience to thy will,My faithful love through joy and ill,That never failed at duty call--O King, is all forgotten, all?\"To Lakshman then she turned and spokeWhile sobs and sighs her utterance broke:\"Sumitrá son, a pile prepare,My refuge in my dark despair.I will not live to bear this weightOf shame, forlorn and desolate.The kindled fire my woes shall endAnd be my best and surest friend.\"His mournful eyes the hero raisedAnd wistfully on Ráma gazed,In whose stern look no ruth was seen,No mercy for the weeping queen.No chieftain dared to meet those eyes,To pray, to question or advise.The word was passed, the wood was piledAnd fain to die stood Janak child.She slowly paced around her lord,The Gods with reverent act adored,Then raising suppliant hands the damePrayed humbly to the Lord of Flame:\"As this fond heart by virtue swayedFrom Raghu son has never strayed,So, universal witness, FireProtect my body on the pyre,As Raghu son has idly laidThis charge on Sítá, hear and aid.\"She ceased: and fearless to the lastWithin the flame wild fury passed.Then rose a piercing cry from allDames, children, men, who saw her fallAdorned with gems and gay attireBeneath the fury of the fire.Canto CXIX. Glory To Vishnu.The shrill cry pierced through Ráma earsAnd his sad eyes o\\'erflowed with tears,When lo, transported through the skyA glorious band of Gods was nigh.Ancestral shades,(1016) by men revered,In venerable state appeared,And he from whom all riches flow,(1017)And Yáma Lord who reigns below:King Indra, thousand-eyed, and heWho wields the sceptre of the sea.(1018)The God who shows the blazoned bull,(1019)And Brahmá Lord most bountifulBy whose command the worlds were madeAll these on radiant cars conveyed,Brighter than sun-beams, sought the placeWhere stood the prince of Raghu race,And from their glittering seats the bestOf blessed Gods the chief addressed:\"Couldst thou, the Lord of all, couldst thou,Creator of the worlds, allowThy queen, thy spouse to brave the fireAnd give her body to the pyre?Dost thou not yet, supremely wise,Thy heavenly nature recognize?\"They ceased: and Ráma thus began:\"I deem myself a mortal man.Of old Ikshváku line, I springFrom Dasaratha Kosal king.\"He ceased: and Brahmá self replied:\"O cast the idle thought aside.Thou art the Lord Náráyan, thouThe God to whom all creatures bow.Thou art the saviour God who woreOf old the semblance of a boar;Thou he whose discus overthrowsAll present, past and future foes;Thou Brahmá, That whose days extendWithout beginning, growth or end;The God, who, bears the bow of horn,Whom four majestic arms adorn;Thou art the God who rules the senseAnd sways with gentle influence;Thou all-pervading Vishnu LordWho wears the ever-conquering sword;Thou art the Guide who leads aright,Thou Krishna of unequalled might.Thy hand, O Lord, the hills and plains,And earth with all her life sustains;Thou wilt appear in serpent formWhen sinks the earth in fire and storm.Queen Sítá of the lovely browsIs Lakshmí thy celestial spouse.To free the worlds from Rávan thouWouldst take the form thou wearest now.Rejoice: the mighty task is done:Rejoice, thou great and glorious one.The tyrant, slain, thy labours end:Triumphant now to heaven ascend.High bliss awaits the devoteeWho clings in loving faith to thee,Who celebrates with solemn praiseThe Lord of ne\\'er beginning days.On earth below, in heaven aboveGreat joy shall crown his faith and love.And he who loves the tale divineWhich tells each glorious deed of thineThrough life fair course shall never knowThe fierce assault of pain and woe.\"(1020)Canto CXX. Sítá Restored.Thus spoke the Self-existent Sire:Then swiftly from the blazing pyreThe circling flames were backward rolled,And, raising in his gentle holdAlive unharmed the Maithil dame,The Lord of Fire embodied came.Fair as the morning was her sheen,And gold and gems adorned the queen.Her form in crimson robes arrayed,Her hair was bound in glossy braid.Her wreath was fresh and sweet of scent,Undimmed was every ornament.Then, standing close to Ráma\\'a side,The universal witness cried:\"From every blot and blemish freeThy faithful queen returns to thee.In word or deed, in look or mindHer heart from thee has ne\\'er declined.By force the giant bore awayFrom thy lone cot his helpless prey;And in his bowers securely keptShe still has longed for thee and wept.With soft temptation, bribe and threat,He bade the dame her love forget:But, nobly faithful to her lord,Her soul the giant suit abhorred.Receive, O King, thy queen again,Pure, ever pure from spot and stain.\"Still stood the king in thoughtful moodAnd tears of joy his eyes bedewed.Then to the best of Gods the bestOf warrior chiefs his mind expressed:\"\\'Twas meet that mid the thousands hereThe searching fire my queen should clear;For long within the giant bowerShe dwelt the vassal of his power.For else had many a slanderous tongueReproaches on mine honour flung,And scorned the king who, love-impelled,His consort from the proof withheld.No doubt had I, but surely knewThat Janak child was pure and true,That, come what might, in good and illHer faithful heart was with me still.I knew that Rávan could not wrongMy queen whom virtue made so strong.I knew his heart would sink and fail,Nor dare her honour to assail,As Ocean, when he raves and roars,Fears to o\\'erleap his bounding shores.Now to the worlds her truth is shown,And Sítá is again mine own.Thus proved before unnumbered eyes,On her pure fame no shadow lies.As heroes to their glory cleave,Mine own dear spouse I ne\\'er will leave.\"He ceased: and clasped in fond embraceOn his dear breast she hid her face.Canto CXXI. Dasaratha.To him Mahesvar thus replied:\"O strong-armed hero, lotus-eyed,Thou, best of those who love the right,Hast nobly fought the wondrous fight.Dispelled by thee the doom that spreadThrough trembling earth and heaven is fled.The worlds exult in light and bliss,And praise thy name, O chief, for this.Now peace to Bharat heart restore,And bid Kausalyá weep no more.Thy face let Queen Kaikeyí see,Let fond Sumitrá gaze on thee.The longing of thy friends relieve,The kingdom of thy sires receive.Let sons of gentle Sítá bornIkshváku ancient line adorn.Then from all care and foemen freedPerform the offering of the steed.In pious gifts thy wealth expend,Then to the home of Gods ascend,Thy sire, this glorious king, behold,Among the blest in heaven enrolled.He comes from where the Immortals dwell:Salute him, for he loves thee well.\"His mandate Raghu sons obeyed,And to their sire obeisance made,Where high he stood above the carIn wondrous light that shone afar,His limbs in radiant garments dressedWhereon no spot of dust might rest.When on the son he loved so wellThe eyes of Dasaratha fell,He strained the hero to his breastAnd thus with gentle words addressed:\"No joy to me is heavenly bliss,For there these eyes my Ráma miss.Enrolled on high with saint and sage,Thy woes, dear son, my thoughts engage.Kaikeyí guile I ne\\'er forget:Her cruel words will haunt me yet,Which sent thee forth, my son, to roamThe forest far from me and home.Now when I look on each dear face,And hold you both in fond embrace,My heart is full of joy to seeThe sons I love from danger free.Now know I what the Gods designed,And how in Ráma form enshrinedThe might of Purushottam lay,The tyrant of the worlds to slay.Ah, how Kausalyá will rejoiceTo hear again her darling voice,And, all thy weary wanderings o\\'er,To gaze upon thy face once more.Ah blest, for ever blest are theyWhose eyes shall see the glorious dayOf thy return in joy at last,Thy term of toil and exile past.Ayodhyá lord, begin thy reign,And day by day new glory gain.\"He ceased: and Ráma thus replied:\"Be not this grace, O sire, denied.Those hasty words, that curse revokeWhich from thy lips in anger broke:\"Kaikeyí, be no longer mine:I cast thee off, both thee and thine.\"O father, let no sorrow fallOn her or hers: thy curse recall.\"\"Yea, she shall live, if so thou wilt,\"The sire replied, \"absolved from guilt.\"Round Lakshman then his arms he threw,And moved by love began anew:\"Great store of merit shall be thine,And brightly shall thy glory shine;Secure on earth thy brother grace.And high in heaven shall be thy place.Thy glorious king obey and fear:To him the triple world is dear.God, saint, and sage, by Indra led,To Ráma bow the reverent head,Nor from the Lord, the lofty-souled,Their worship or their praise withhold.Heart of the Gods, supreme is he,The One who ne\\'er shall cease to be.\"On Sítá then he looked and smiled;\"List to my words\" he said, \"dear child,Let not thy gentle breast retainOne lingering trace of wrath or pain.When by the fire thy truth be proved,By love for thee his will was moved.The furious flame thy faith confessedWhich shrank not from the awful test:And thou, in every heart enshrined,Shalt live the best of womankind.\"He ceased: he bade the three adieu,And home to heaven exulting flew.Canto CXXII. Indra Boon.Then Indra, he whose fiery strokeSlew furious Páka, turned and spoke:\"A glorious day, O chief, is this,Rich with the fruit of lasting bliss.Well pleased are we: we love thee wellNow speak, thy secret wishes tell.\"Thus spake the sovereign of the sky,And this was Ráma glad reply:\"If I have won your grace, inclineTo grant this one request of mine.Restore, O King: the Vánar deadWhose blood for me was nobly shed.To life and strength my friends recall,And bring them back from Yáma hall.When, fresh in might the warriors rise,Prepare a feast to glad their eyes.Let fruits of every season glow,And streams of purest water flow.\"Thus Raghu son, great-hearted, prayed,And Indra thus his answer made:\"High is the boon thou seekest: noneShould win this grace but Raghu son.Yet, faithful to the word I spake,I grant the prayer for thy dear sake.The Vánars whom the giants slewTheir life and vigour shall renew.Their strength repaired, their gashes healedWhose torrents dyed the battle field,The warrior hosts from death shall riseLike sleepers when their slumber flies.\"Restored from Yáma dark domainThe Vánar legions filled the plain,And, round the royal chief arrayed,With wondering hearts obeisance paid.Each God the son of Raghu praised,And cried as loud his voice he raised:\"Turn, King, to fair Ayodhyá speed,And leave thy friends of Vánar breed.Thy true devoted consort cheerAfter long days of woe and fear.Bharat, thy loyal brother, see,A hermit now for love of thee.The tears of Queen Kausalyá dry,And light with joy each stepdame eye;Then consecrated king of menMake glad each faithful citizen.\"They ceased: and borne on radiant carsSought their bright home amid the stars.Canto CXXIII. The Magic Car.Then slept the tamer of his foesAnd spent the night in calm repose.Vibhishan came when morning broke,And hailed the royal chief, and spoke:\"Here wait thee precious oil and scents,And rich attire and ornaments.The brimming urns are newly filled,And women in their duty skilled,With lotus-eyes, thy call attend,Assistance at thy bath to lend.\"\"Let others,\" Ráma cried, \"desireThese precious scents, this rich attire,I heed not such delights as these,For faithful Bharat, ill at ease,Watching for me is keeping nowFar far away his rigorous vow.By Bharat side I long to stand,I long to see my fatherland.Far is Ayodhyá: long, alas,The dreary road and hard to pass.\"\"One day,\" Vibhishan cried, \"one dayShall bear thee o\\'er that length of way.Is not the wondrous chariot mine,Named Pushpak, wrought by hands divine.The prize which Rávan seized of oldVictorious o\\'er the God of Gold?This chariot, kept with utmost care,Will waft thee through the fields of air,And thou shalt light unwearied downIn fair Ayodhyá royal town.But yet if aught that I have doneHas pleased thee well, O Raghu son;If still thou carest for thy friend,Some little time in Lanká spend;There after toil of battle restWithin my halls an honoured guest.\"Again the son of Raghu spake:\"Thy life was perilled for my sake.Thy counsel gave me priceless aid:All honours have been richly paid.Scarce can my love refuse, O bestOf giant kind, thy last request.But still I yearn once more to seeMy home and all most dear to me;Nor can I brook one hour delay:Forgive me, speed me on my way.\"He ceased: the magic car was brought.Of yore by Visvakarmá wrought.In sunlike sheen it flashed and blazed;And Raghu sons in wonder gazed.Canto CXXIV. The Departure.The giant lord the chariot viewed,And humbly thus his speech renewed:\"Behold, O King, the car prepared:Now be thy further will declared.\"He ceased: and Ráma spake once more:\"These hosts who thronged to Lanká shoreTheir faith and might have nobly shown,And set thee on the giants\\' throne.Let pearls and gems and gold repayThe feats of many a desperate day,That all may go triumphant henceProud of their noble recompense.\"Vibhishan, ready at his call,With gold and gems enriched them all.Then Ráma clomb the glorious carThat shone like day resplendent star.There in his lap he held his dameVailing her eyes in modest shame.Beside him Lakshman took his stand,Whose mighty bow still armed his hand,\"O King Vibhishan,\" Ráma cried,\"O Vánar chiefs, so long allied,My comrades till the foemen fell,List, for I speak a long farewell.The task, in doubt and fear begun,With your good aid is nobly done.Leave Lanká shore, your steps retrace,Brave warriors of the Vánar race.Thou, King Sugríva, true, through all,To friendship bond and duty call,Seek far Kishkindhá with thy trainAnd o\\'er thy realm in glory reign.Farewell, Vibhishan, Lanká throneWon by our arms is now thine own,Thou, mighty lord, hast nought to dreadFrom heavenly Gods by Indra led.My last farewell, 0 King, receive,For Lanká isle this hour I leave.\"Loud rose their cry in answer: \"We,O Raghu son, would go with thee.With thee delighted would we strayWhere sweet Ayodhyá groves are gay,Then in the joyous synod viewKing-making balm thy brows bedew;Our homage to Kausalyá pay,And hasten on our homeward way.\"Their prayer the son of Raghu heard,And spoke, his heart with rapture stirred:\"Sugríva, O my faithful friend,Vibhishan and ye chiefs, ascend.A joy beyond all joys the bestWill fill my overflowing breast,If girt by you, O noble band,I seek again my native land.\"With Vánar lords in danger triedSugríva sprang to Ráma side,And girt by chiefs of giant kindVibhíshan step was close behind.Swift through the air, as Ráma chose,The wondrous car from earth arose.And decked with swans and silver wingsBore through the clouds its freight of kings.Canto CXXV. The Return.Then Ráma, speeding through the skies,Bent on the earth his eager eyes:\"Look, Sítá, see, divinely plannedAnd built by Visvakarmá hand,Lanká the lovely city restEnthroned on Mount Trikúta crestBehold those fields, ensanguined yet,Where Vánar hosts and giants met.There, vainly screened by charm and spell,The robber Rávan fought and fell.There knelt Mandodarí(1021) and shedHer tears in floods for Rávan dead.And every dame who loved him sentFrom her sad heart her wild lament.There gleams the margin of the deep,Where, worn with toil, we sank to sleep.Look, love, the unconquered sea behold,King Varun home ordained of old,Whose boundless waters roar and swellRich with their store of pearl and shell.O see, the morning sun is brightOn fair Hiranyanábha(1022) height,Who rose from Ocean sheltering breastThat Hanumán might stay and rest.There stretches, famed for evermore,The wondrous bridge from shore to shore.The worlds, to life remotest day,Due reverence to the work shall pay,Which holier for the lapse of timeShall give release from sin and crime.Now thither bend, dear love, thine eyesWhere green with groves Kishkindhá lies,The seat of King Sugríva reign,Where Báli by this hand was slain.(1023)There Ríshyamúka hill beholdBright gleaming with embedded gold.There too my wandering foot I set,There King Sugríva first I met.And, where yon trees their branches wave,My promise of assistance gave.There, flushed with lilies, Pampá shinesWith banks which greenest foliage lines,Where melancholy steps I bentAnd mourned thee with a mad lament.There fierce Kabandha, spreading wideHis giant arms, in battle died.Turn, Sítá, turn thine eyes and seeIn Janasthán that glorious tree:There Rávan, lord of giants slewOur friend Jatáyus brave and true,Thy champion in the hopeless strife,Who gave for thee his noble life.Now mark that glade amid the treesWhere once we lived as devotees.See, see our leafy cot betweenThose waving boughs of densest green,Where Rávan seized his prize and stoleMy love the darling of my soul.O, look again: beneath thee gleamsGodávarí the best of streams,Whose lucid waters sweetly glideBy lilies that adorn her side.There dwelt Agastya, holy sage,In plantain-sheltered hermitage.See Sarabhanga humble shedWhich sovereign Indra visited.See where the gentle hermits dwellNeath Atri rule who loved us well;Where once thine eyes were blest to seeHis sainted dame who talked with thee.Now rest thine eyes with new delightOn Chitrakúta woody height,See Jumna flashing in the sunThrough groves of brilliant foliage run.Screened by the shade of spreading boughs.There Bharadvája keeps his vows,There Gangá, river of the skies,Rolls the sweet wave that purifies,There Sringavera towers ascendWhere Guha reigns, mine ancient friend.I see, I see thy glittering spires,Ayodhyá, city of my sires.Bow down, bow down thy head, my sweet,Our home, our long-lost home to greet.\"Canto CXXVI. Bharat Consoled.But Ráma bade the chariot stay,And halting in his airy way,In Bharadvája holy shadeHis homage to the hermit paid.\"O saint,\" he cried, \"I yearn to knowMy dear Ayodhyá weal and woe.O tell me that the people thrive,And that the queens are yet alive.\"Joy gleamed in Bhardvája eye,Who gently smiled and made reply:\"Thy brother, studious of thy will,Is faithful and obedient still.In tangled twine he coils his hair:Thy safe return is all his care.Before thy shoes he humbly bends,And to thy house and realm attends.When first these dreary years began,When first I saw the banished man,With Sítá, in his hermit coat,At this sad heart compassion smote.My breast with tender pity swelled:I saw thee from thy home expelled,Reft of all princely state, forlorn,A hapless wanderer travel-worn,Firm in thy purpose to fulfilThy duty and thy father will.But boundless is my rapture now:Triumphant, girt with friends, art thou.Where\\'er thy wandering steps have been,Thy joy and woe mine eyes have seen.Thy glorious deeds to me art known,The Bráhmans saved, the foes o\\'erthrown.Such power have countless seasons spentIn penance and devotion lent.Thy virtues, best of chiefs, I know,And now a boon would fain bestow.This hospitable gift(1024) receive:Then with the dawn my dwelling leave.\"The bended head of Ráma showedHis reverence for the grace bestowed;Then for each brave companion sakeHe sought a further boon and spake:\"O let that mighty power of thineThe road to fair Ayodhyá lineWith trees where fruit of every hueThe Vánars\\' eye and taste may woo,And flowers of every season, sweetWith stores of honeyed juice, may meet.\"The hero ceased: the hermit bentHis reverend head in glad assent;And swift, as Bharadvája willed,The prayer of Ráma was fulfilled.For many a league the lengthening roadTrees thick with fruit and blossom showedWith luscious beauty to enticeThe taste like trees of Paradise.The Vánars passed beneath the shadeOf that delightful colonnade,Still tasting with unbounded gleeThe treasures of each wondrous tree.Canto CXXVII. Ráma Message.But Ráma, when he first looked downAnd saw afar Ayodhyá town,Had called Hanumán to his side,The chief on whom his heart relied,And said: \"Brave Vánar, good at need,Haste onward, to Ayodhyá speed,And learn, I pray, if all be wellWith those who in the palace dwell.But as thou speedest on thy wayAwhile at Sringavera stay.Tell Guha the Nishádas\\' lord,That victor, with my queen restored,In health and strength with many a friendHomeward again my steps I bend.Thence by the road that he will showOn to Ayodhyá swiftly go.There with my love my brother greet,And all our wondrous tale repeat.Say that victorious in the strifeI come with Lakshman and my wife,Then mark with keenest eye each traceOf joy or grief on Bharat face.Be all his gestures closely viewed,Each change of look and attitude.Where breathes the man who will not clingTo all that glorifies a king?Where beats the heart that can resignAn ancient kingdom, nor repineTo lose a land renowned for breedsOf elephants and warrior steeds?If, won by custom day by day,My brother Bharat thirsts for sway,Still let him rule the nations, stillThe throne of old Ikshváku fill.Go, mark him well: his feelings learn,And, ere we yet be near return.\"He ceased: and, garbed in human form,Forth sped Hanúmán swift as storm.Sublime in air he rose, and throughThe region of his father flew.He saw far far beneath his feetWhere Gangá flood and Jumna meet.Descending from the upper airHe entered Sringavera, whereKing Guha heart was well contentTo hear the message Ráma sent.Then, with his mighty strength renewed,The Vánar chief his way pursued,Válúkiní was far behind,And Gomatí with forests lined,And golden fields and pastures gayWith flocks and herds beneath him lay.Then Nandigráma charmed his eyeWhere flowers were bright with every dye,And trees of lovely foliage madeWith meeting boughs delightful shade,Where women watched in trim arrayTheir little sons\\' and grandsons\\' play.His eager eye on Bharat fellWho sat before his lonely cell.In hermit weed, with tangled hair,Pale, weak, and worn with ceaseless care.His royal pomp and state resignedFor Ráma still he watched and pined,Still to his dreary vows adhered,And royal Ráma shoes revered.Yet still the terror of his armPreserved the land from fear and harm.The Wind-God son, in form a man,Raised reverent hands and thus began:\"Fond greeting, Prince, I bring to thee,And Ráma self has sent it: heFor whom thy spirit sorrows yetAs for a hapless anchoretIn Dandak wood, in dire distress,With matted hair and hermit dress.This sorrow from thy bosom fling,And hear the tale of joy I bring.This day thy brother shalt thou meetExulting in his foe defeat,Freed from his toil and lengthened vow,The light of victory on his brow,With Sítá, Lakshman and his friendsHomeward at last his steps he bends.\"Then joy, too mighty for control,Rushed in full flood o\\'er Bharat soul;His reeling sense and strength gave way,And fainting on the earth he lay,At length upspringing from the ground,His arms about Hanúmán wound,With tender tears of rapture sprung,He dewed the neck to which he clung:\"Art thou a God or man,\" he cried,\"Whom love and pity hither guide?For this a hundred thousand kine,A hundred villages be thine.A score of maids of spotless livesTo thee I give to be thy wives,Of golden hue and bright of face,Each lovely for her tender grace.\"He ceased a while by joy subdued,And then his eager speech renewed.Canto CXXVIII. Hanumán Story.\"In doubt and fear long years have passedAnd glorious tidings come at last.True, true is now the ancient verseWhich men in time of bliss rehearse:\"Once only in a hundred yearsGreat joy to mortal men appears.\"But now his woes and triumph tell,And loss and gain as each befell.\"He ceased: Hanúmán mighty-souledThe tale of Ráma wanderings toldFrom that first day on which he stoodIn the drear shade of Dandak wood.He told how fierce Virádha fell;He told of Sarabhanga cellWhere Ráma saw with wondering eyesIndra descended from the skies.He told how Súrpanakhí came,Her soul aglow with amorous flame,And fled repulsed, with rage and tears,Reft of her nose and severed ears.He told how Ráma might subduedThe giants\\' furious multitude;How Khara with the troops he ledAnd Trisirás and Dúshan bled:How Ráma, tempted from his cot,The golden deer pursued and shot,And Rávan came and stole awayThe Maithil queen his hapless prey,When, as he fought, the dame to save,His noble life Jatáyus gave:How Ráma still the the search renewed,The robber to his hold pursued,Bridging the sea from shore to shore,And found his queen to part no more.(1025)Canto CXXIX. The Meeting With Bharat.O\\'erwhelmed with rapture Bharat heardThe tale that all his being stirred,And, heralding the glad event,This order to Satrughna sent:\"Let every shrine with flowers be gayLet incense burn and music play.Go forth, go forth to meet your king,Let tabours sound and minstrels sing,Let bards swell high the note of praiseSkilled in the lore of ancient days,Call forth the royal matrons: callEach noble from the council hall.Send all we love and honour most,Send Bráhmans and the warrior host,A glorious company to bringIn triumph home our lord the king.\"Great rapture filled Satrughna breast,Obedient to his brother hest.\"Send forth ten thousand men\" he cried,\"Let brawny arms be stoutly plied,And, smoothing all with skilful care,The road for Kosal king prepare.Then o\\'er the earth let thousands throwFresh showers of water cool as snow,And others strew with garlands gayWith loveliest blooms our monarch way.On tower and temple porch and gateLet banners wave in royal state,And be each roof and terrace linedWith blossoms loose and chaplets twined.\"The nobles hasting forth fulfilledHis order as Satrughna willed.Sublime on elephants they rodeWhose gilded girths with jewels glowed.Attended close by thousands moreGay with the gear and flags they bore.A thousand chiefs their steeds bestrode,Their glittering cars a thousand showed.And countless hosts in rich arrayPursued on foot their eager way.Veiled from the air with silken screensIn litters rode the widowed queens.Kausalyá first, acknowledged headAnd sovereign of the household, led:Sumitrá next, and after, damesOf lower rank and humbler names.Then compassed by a white-robed throngOf Bráhmans, heralded with song,With shouts of joy from countless throats,And shells\\' and tambours\\' mingled notes,And drums resounding long and loud,Exulting Bharat joined the crowd.Still on his head, well-trained in loreOf duty, Ráma shoes he bore.The moon-white canopy was spreadWith flowery twine engarlanded,And jewelled cheuries, meet to holdO\\'er Ráma brow, shone bright with gold,Though Nandigráma town they neared,Of Ráma yet no sign appeared.Then Bharat called the Vánar chiefAnd questioned thus in doubt and grief:\"Hast thou uncertain, like thy kind,A sweet delusive guile designed?Where, where is royal Ráma? showThe hero, victor of the foe.I gaze, but see no Vánars stillWho wear each varied shape at will.\"In eager love thus Bharat cried,And thus the Wind-God son replied:\"Look, Bharat, on those laden treesThat murmur with the song of bees;For Ráma sake the saint has madeUntimely fruits, unwonted shade.Such power in ages long agoCould Indra gracious boon bestow.O, hear the Vánars\\' voices, hearThe shouting which proclaims them near.E\\'en now about to cross they seemSweet Gomatí delightful stream.I see, I see the car designedBy Brahmá own creative mind,The car which, radiant as the moon,Moves at the will by Brahmá boon;The car which once was Rávan pride,The victor spoil when Rávan died.Look, there are Raghu sons: betweenThe brothers stands the rescued queen.There is Vibhishan full in view,Sugríva and his retinue.\"He ceased: then rapture loosed each tongue:From men and dames, from old and young,One long, one universal cry,\\'Tis he, \\'tis Ráma, smote the sky.All lighted down with eager speedFrom elephant and car and steed,And every joyful eye intentOn Ráma moonbright face was bent.Entranced a moment Bharat gazed:Then reverential hands he raised,And on his brother humbly pressedThe honours due to welcome guest.Then Bharat clomb the car to greetHis king and bowed him at his feet,Till Ráma raised him face to faceAnd held him in a close embrace.Then Lakshman and the Maithil dameHe greeted as he spoke his name(1026)He greeted next, supreme in place,The sovereign of the Vánar race,And Jámbaván and Báli son,And lords and chiefs, omitting none.(1027)Sugríva to his heart he pressedAnd thus with grateful words addressed:\"Four brothers, Vánar king, were we,And now we boast a fifth in thee.By kindly acts a friend we know:Offence and wrong proclaim the foe.\"To King Vibhishan then he spake:\"Well hast thou fought for Ráma sake.\"Nor was the brave Satrughna slowHis reverential love to showTo both his brothers, as was meet,And venerate the lady feet.Then Ráma to his mother came,Saw her pale cheek and wasted frame,With gentle words her heart consoled,And clasped her feet with loving hold.Then at Sumitrá feet he bent,And fair Kaikeyí, reverent,Greeted each dame from chief to least,And bowed him to the household priest.Up rose a shout from all the throng:\"O welcome, Ráma, mourned so long.Welcome, Kausalyá joy and pride,\"Ten hundred thousand voices cried.Then Bharat placed, in duty taught,On Ráma feet the shoes he brought:\"My King,\" he cried, \"receive againThe pledge preserved through years of pain,The rule and lordship of the landEntrusted to my weaker hand.No more I sigh o\\'er sorrows past,My birth and life are blest at lastIn the glad sight this day has shown,When Ráma comes to rule his own.\"He ceased: the faithful love that movedThe prince soul each heart approved;Nor could the Vánar chiefs refrainFrom tender tears that fell like rain.Then Ráma, stirred with joy anew,His arms about his brother threw,And to the grove his course he bentWhere Bharat hermit days were spent.Alighting in that pure retreatHe pressed the earth with eager feet.Then, at his hest, the car rose highAnd sailing through the northern skySped homeward to the Lord of GoldWho owned the wondrous prize of old.(1028)Canto CXXX. The Consecration.Then, reverent hand to hand applied,Thus Bharat to his brother cried:\"Thy realm, O King, is now restored,Uninjured to the rightful lord.This feeble arm with toil and pain,The weighty charge could scarce sustain.And the great burthen wellnigh brokeThe neck untrained to bear the yoke.The royal swan outspeeds the crow:The steed is swift, the mule is slow,Nor can my feeble feet be ledO\\'er the rough ways where thine should tread.Now grant what all thy subjects ask:Begin, O King, thy royal task.Now let our longing eyes beholdThe glorious rite ordained of old,And on the new-found monarch headLet consecrating drops be shed.\"He ceased; victorious Ráma bentHis head in token of assent.He sat, and tonsors trimmed with careHis tangles of neglected hairThen, duly bathed, the hero shoneWith all his splendid raiment on.And Sítá with the matrons\\' aidHer limbs in shining robes arrayed,Sumantra then, the charioteer,Drew, ordered by Satrughna near,And stayed within the hermit groveThe chariot and the steeds he drove.Therein Sugríva consorts, gracedWith gems, and Ráma queen were placed,All fain Ayodhyá to behold:And swift away the chariot rolled.Like Indra Lord of Thousand Eyes,Drawn by fleet lions through the skies.Thus radiant in his glory showedKing Ráma as he homeward rode,In power and might unparalleled.The reins the hand of Bharat held.Above the peerless victor headThe snow-white shade Satrughna spread,And Lakshman ever-ready handHis forehead with a chourie fanned.Vibhishan close to Lakshman sideSharing his task a chourie plied.Sugríva on Satrunjay came,An elephant of hugest frame:Nine thousand others bore, behind,The chieftains of the Vánar kindAll gay, in forms of human mould,With rich attire and gems and gold.Thus borne along in royal stateKing Ráma reached Ayodbyá gateWith merry noise of shells and drumsAnd joyful shouts, He comes, he comes,A Bráhman host with solemn tread,And kine the long procession led,And happy maids in ordered bandsThrew grain and gold with liberal hands.Neath gorgeous flags that waved in rowsOn towers and roofs and porticoes.Mid merry crowds who sang and cheeredThe palace of the king they neared.Then Raghu son to Bharat, bestOf duty slaves, these words addressed:\"Pass onward to the monarch hall.The high-souled Vánars with thee call,And let the chieftains, as is meet,The widows of our father greet.And to the Vánar king assignThose chambers, best of all, which shineWith lazulite and pearl inlaid,And pleasant grounds with flowers and shade.\"He ceased: and Bharat bent his head;Sugríva by the hand he ledAnd passed within the palace whereStood couches which Satrughna care,With robes and hangings richly dyed,And burning lamps, had seen supplied.Then Bharat spake: \"I pray thee, friend,Thy speedy messengers to send,Each sacred requisite to bringThat we may consecrate our king.\"Sugríva raised four urns of gold,The water for the rite to hold,And bade four swiftest Vánars fleeAnd fill them from each distant sea.Then east and west and south and northThe Vánar envoys hastened forth.Each in swift flight an ocean soughtAnd back through air his treasure brought,And full five hundred floods besidePure water for the king supplied.Then girt by many a Bráhman sage,Vasishtha, chief for reverend age,High on a throne with jewels gracedKing Ráma and his Sítá placed.There by Jábáli, far revered,Vijay and Kasyap son appeared;By Gautam side Kátváyan stood,And Vámadeva wise and good,Whose holy hands in order shedThe pure sweet drops on Ráma head.Then priests and maids and warriors, allApproaching at Vasishtha call,With sacred drops bedewed their king,The centre of a joyous ring,The guardians of the worlds, on high,And all the children of the skyFrom herbs wherewith their hands were filledRare juices on his brow distilled.His brows were bound with glistering goldWhich Manu self had worn of old,Bright with the flash of many a gemHis sire ancestral diadem.Satrughna lent his willing aidAnd o\\'er him held the regal shade:The monarchs whom his arm had savedThe chouries round his forehead waved.A golden chain, that flashed and glowedWith gems the God of Wind bestowed:Mahendra gave a glorious stringOf fairest pearls to deck the king,The skies with acclamation rang,The gay nymphs danced, the minstrels sang.On that blest day the joyful plainWas clothed anew with golden grain.The trees the witching influence knew,And bent with fruits of loveliest hue,And Ráma consecration lentNew sweetness to each flowret scent.The monarch, joy of Raghu line,Gave largess to the Bráhmans, kineAnd steeds unnumbered, wealth untoldOf robes and pearls and gems and gold.A jewelled chain, whose lustre passedThe glory of the sun, he castAbout his friend Sugríva neck;And, Angad Báli son to deck,He gave a pair of armlets brightWith diamond and lazulite.A string of pearls of matchless hueWhich gleams like tender moonlight threwAdorned with gems of brightest sheen,He gave to grace his darling queen.The offering from his hand receivedA moment on her bosom heaved;Then from her neck the chain she drew,A glance on all the Vánars threw,And wistful eyes on Ráma bentAs still she held the ornament.Her wish he knew, and made replyTo that mute question of her eye:\"Yea, love; the chain on him bestowWhose wisdom truth and might we know,The firm ally, the faithful friendThrough toil and peril to the end.\"Then on Hanúmán bosom hungThe chain which Sítá hand had flung:So may a cloud, when winds are stillWith moon-lit silver gird a hill.To every Vánar Ráma gaveRich treasures from the mine and wave.And with their honours well contentHomeward their steps the chieftains bent.Ten thousand years Ayodhyá, blestWith Ráma rule, had peace and rest,No widow mourned her murdered mate,No house was ever desolate.The happy land no murrain knew,The flocks and herds increased and grew.The earth her kindly fruits supplied,No harvest failed, no children died.Unknown were want, disease, and crime:So calm, so happy was the time.(1029)'}"
