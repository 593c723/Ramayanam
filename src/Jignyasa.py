         there are not many in India who havenâ€™t heard its name. The fascination that 
         this story never fails to provoke in me is rooted in childish wonder - born of tales told 
         in confidant tones, after much pleading and persuasion; furthered, by the encounters with 
         different versions; a fascination that evinced in me interest enough to try my hand at 
         comprehending the original Sanskrit version - an endeavour that has failed as of yet to 
         do anything but elicit a sense of protracted annoyance at my own excruciatingly slow progress. """)

         I decided then, to employ something that I was more familiar with - something that was 
         sure to give me the results that had so far managed to evade me. I turned thus to my trusty 
         set of analytical tools - and what answers have they given me!
