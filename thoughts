> On the side: On hover over node
![alt text](image.png)
Create a df for this, with book col also; any and all per char info as a scrollable element  

> Other metrics: (for graph)
The graph diameter (the furthest distance between any two characters) is 9 hops.
The graph is relatively sparse (meaning many characters are not directly linked) with a density rating of .032.

1) *** Chapter wise stuff: https://jeffreylancaster.com/game-of-thrones/episode/
below: node(char) and graph(chap) metrics to be displayed
> Along with the dendograms, can you also give sub-networks for chapters?(this is generated in  the cooccs data gen, but is not really put into the csv)
> Also, give centrality information?
> Char info- existing, new(see 3); in char info - give centrality tables, ranking, imp of chap to char etc
> Most important chars(most frequently occu or centrality measures)
> Proportion of important chars in chap(imp of chars derieved from per book networks and their top centralities) to determine how important a chap is to the book(also explore already calc vals in clusts ipynb like norm, freq norm etc - put them in a csv):  Rank them andproduce rank in chap wie analysis. Then you will get a list of most imp chaps to books.(this u can provide in a overview so that it can act as a guide for ppl to search particular chaps of the 493- that's a huge no.)
> k means, but only if u can manage hover and embed as html

2) Centrality analysis- Analyse book wise maybe, provide meanings, also, make graphs: ie., character wise centrality evolving over time(multi-line graph)(see c). 
or over chapters for each book
> Data - Network(coocc table), per chaps or books
> Determine which chars are imp/ how imp a char is; diff in importance of 1st imp char n 2nd imp char etc(rank them and analyse imp dist.)(the latter-is actually represented in the graphs of multiple chars over time)
> to understand more metrics: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1606/1606.02610.pdf
% PLOT EVOLUTION %

3) % PLOT EVOLUTION %
Entities: existing, new, disapperaing - over chapters/books
Interactions
(You have chars for each chap; subtract previous chap list to get new chars; from the prev to get disappearing; maintain an existing chars list ): So, u will know the chars that are introduced at each chap
Plot a graph for evolution(see c)

4) Instead of k-means; use gnn to classify nodes? and then color them. Link prediction i dont think is req  
Or apparently(:===) Girvan–Newman algorithm
Or for netwrok colors: modularity

5) Summary network graphs for books- cos the originals are too large(k-core)
> Maybe give with a summary of text also, nlp text summarization(dunno if it will work on this stupid poetry tho)
If you need no. of connections to a node, can you use pagerank or something from nx? Instead of sittin and counting from the df
> Dendogram of k-cores vertices, provided k is large enough to not end up with too many nodes?
degeneracy etc(the conept just sounds fun). creating this will require data per book and also funciton modification.
> - Now, an extractive approach for text summarization would have mapped well with the k-cores, because, under the hood it runs based on frequencies and importance of words afterall. So teh kcore map would show exactly what the exxtractive summary portrays

6) Compare 2 books
> At each chapter(gotta somehow normalise this with the timeline maybe), new char, ex char occs etc
> Maybe compare k-core summaries or coloured(classified) networks
> If they are 2 books with the same story(like in ur case) - need to normalise characters also
> Compare embedding distances(see c) 
"""Note that it would be relevant only if more than two books are processed (not the case here) — in order to have an idea of the order of magnitude for the metric."""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) BERT NER for places??
>For names: https://aclanthology.org/D15-1088.pdf
>or run a ner tagger and if 1 entity gets tagged with diff tags, get the mode
>Or chatgpt

100) You can save networks from pyvis- wanna provide navigation over book?
Or, you can just merge multiple htmls or write other stuff in this html oly


You need to figure out how to add stuff in 1 col(into books), based on another col, so that redundancy is avoided 
Can you get ai to generate pics of chars from the text itself? and then put it in the viz?

==========================================================================================

Indian texts usually have characters(the trinity for eg) appearing in multiple books. It is not a 
book series, but something better- something larger. 
Analyse - characters- occurences, descriptions, temparament over multiple books(generate inferences)

There are multiple versions of Ramayana, from Valmiki's, and Kamba's to Tulsi Das's
Analyse how the story/plot differs in each, how much importance each character is attributed, etc.

If everybody knows Rama and Rama doesnt know everybody, then in a graph, wouldnt Rama be connected to everybody unless it is a directed one? Assuming that you are forming your connections based on people knowing people ofcourse - so that wouldnt really be a problem if you are generating your graph based on conversations or occurences and proximity.

Centralities:
1) Page-Rank - Who's the most connected(to a lot of other people)(Do you have many interactions with important people?)
2) Betweeness - Who acts as the go-between for multiple communities(the sole intersection)
3) Closeness - What is the closest relationship?(Brothers? Spouse?)
4) Eigen vector -  Do you have many connections to important people?
5) Degree - Do you have many connections?

Independent Cascade(spread of roumors) -> visualize how info spreads
If at the end of the books- Sita is disconnected from everyone except a group of Hermits, then it will validate Rama not knowing of Lav and Kusha's existence until ofcourse, they meet again.

ie., The characters relationship graph should both evolve and devolve over time

Can do: 
See: https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones/blob/master/README.md#narrative-charts

1) A visualization of how long each character has been on-screen throughout the show.
2) A matrix visualization of how often characters are on screen together.
3) Locations on a Globe + char travels through it over chapters

Characters Per Location Per Time (Heatmap) before map viz of characters
Number of Characters Per Scene 
Continuous Screen Time
