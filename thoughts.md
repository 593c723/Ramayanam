> If I am somehow able to map plot evolutions - ie., how and where exactly is a plot differing in a significatn way

- A single story can be told in different ways - but with the essense and the plot remaining the same, but can you identify if the plot cahnges? How do you model this? To give a broader perspective - imagine distortion of inforamtion as it flows from 1 person to another -  thats how rumors are formed, when the truth gets warped
- So you have an original version, and then it gets changed, little by little maybe, to arrive at something unrecognisable. 
-  you need to identify these changes - their occurence and the change itself
- but when you have two or more books with more or less the same characters, how do u model the differences?
